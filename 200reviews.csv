0,"Excellent and Authentic recipe! A little more work and ingredients, but well worth it. Use FRESH basil for more flavor - I use about 1/2 - 2/3 cup fresh chopped basil. It cooks down and is sooo aromatic. The mix of sausage and beef is sublime, so no need for more salt. I always add a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture (an old italian secret!). I usually make this a day ahead for the flavors and herbs to meld in the fridge then let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking. Have made for company too, and always get RAVES on it's authenticity. Great, winter comfort food and feeds a lot of people. Another tip for lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles. Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min. Noodles won't be cooked but soft, and can complete it's cooking in the oven. I learned this from a caterer - try it!","I made this recipe using some tips and tricks from previous reviewers and from my experience having worked in an italian restaurant. This recipe does not have to be as time intensive as is recommended in the instructions. As another reviewer noted, it is not necessary to cook the noodles--just soak them in hot water while you are cooking the rest of the ingredients. You also do not need to cook the sauce. Sounds bizarre, but it's true. If you make the lasagna ahead and leave it in the fridge overnight, the flavors blend perfectly, no cooking required. For a chunkier tomato sauce, I subbed 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes with diced italian-flavored tomatoes. I layered everything in this order: sauce-noodles-ricotta mixture-sauce-meat-shredded mozzerella...i did 3 layers like this and then finished with a layer of noodles, sauce and shredded mozzerella and a generous sprinkling of parmesean on top. Following this method, I had the whole thing put together and in the fridge in less than an hour. It sat overnight and my husband had it in the oven when I got home from work. Fantastic recipe!","WOW! This really is World's Best Lasagna! From reading all the reviews, I made these changes: Added an additional 1/2 pound of ground meat, omitted the salt, doubled the onions, all the spices, the parsley, canned tomatoes, paste, and sauce. I also doubled the filling ingredients and made three layers instead of two. Everyone raved about the lasagna and I have sauce left over for another use. SIDE NOTE: For anyone who thinks they don't like ricotta cheese: Buy it at an Italian market. Brands such as Sierra or Polly-O. There is no comparison to the taste or texture of supermarket brands. I think that's why I see recipes with regular cottage cheese instead of riccota. I don't use supermarket riccota under any circumstances, it's just plain nasty!","I've convinced 3 (now-ex) boyfriends, my husband, and even a couple Italian friends at school that I make the most incredible lasagna they've ever tasted with this recipe. I make it pretty much as shown, except if I have the time, I let the sauce simmer on the stove as long as possible. I also add a bit of whatever red wine I have on hand to the sauce. And I try to make a double recipe, so I can use the sauce for other things - it works wonderfully for Chicken Parmesan, plain ol' spaghetti, and anywhere else you'd use a red sauce. Everything tastes better the second day, too. Oh, one more thing - I never boil my noodles. I simply buy regular dried noodles, and make sure I have plenty of sauce in the lasagna. It cooks long enough that the noodles boil in the oven, and you end up with a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well.","I read all the reviews and really followed ""Cookerbob""'s advise. Here's what I changed: used 1 lb. LEAN gr. beef, tripled the garlic, reduced sugar to 1 T., reduced salt to 1 t., used 9 lasagna noodles per pan and used 1 pound mozzarella (shredded) cheese per pan. I read the reviews about omitting the fennel and I have to disagree. I believe the fennel is one of the ingredients that makes this dish outstanding. I made the sauce the day before and simmered for 6+ hours. Sounds like a lot of work, but come on! How hard is it to check a pot simmering??! I had enough sauce for 2 pans of lasagna, so that's what I did. Made 2, baked one and froze the other. I just finally made my frozen one yesterday. I allowed it to thaw in the fridge overnight and then baked as directed. Just as delicious as the first batch!!! My hubby is a lasagna snob and says this is the best lasagna recipe ever. I totally agree!","I was so disappointed with this lasagna! I won't be using this recipe again. With such a high rating, I thought it would taste better. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only used 1/3 of the salt called for. (One serving of the original recipe is almost a full daily allowance of sodium.) It was still too salty. It tasted like something you'd buy in the freezer section at the grocery store. Why waste all that time making it at home if it doesn't taste any better than the manufactured stuff and isn't any healthier? There also seemed to be too much sauce and not enough of the ricotta mixture or mozzarella. Suggestions: 1. Leave out the added salt altogether. There's already enough salt in the sausage, parmesan and canned tomato products to season everything. 2. Drain the meat after browning and before adding anything else. All that saturated fat does nothing to improve the flavor. 3. Use oregano instead of Italian seasoning and leave out the fennel. Italian sausage already has fennel in it. 4. Leave out one of the cans of tomato paste. The condensed tomato flavor was so strong it drowned out the spices. 5. Use a full 16-oz block of mozzarella, and grate it instead of slicing it. You'll get more even coverage. 6. Double the ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg, parsley). 7. (Optional) Replace the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of red wine, preferably chianti or cabernet sauvignon.","I quadrupled this recipe for 32 men, and it went over so well ... they came back for seconds, and asked for the recipe for their wives ... now how many men do you know that ask for a recipe? I made a few changes to this recipe based on past reviews and am glad I did ... here are my suggestons ... use fresh whole wheat lasagna noodles (found in the deli dept.) ... no need to cook them and they come in sheets ... make 3 layers for lasagna dish ... therefore, you would require 8 fresh lasagna sheets ... I had to read through a lot of reviews to figure out what to do with the italian sausage, as it doesn't explan in the recipe how to cook that ... what you do is buy mild italian sausages (couldn't find sweet italian sausage and I understand through most reviews that most people can't) ... you then remove the casing around the sausage, remove the meat and fry the meat until cooked in a frying pan ... instead of using 1 tbsp. salt in the sauce, I used 1 tsp. ... and it was perfect ... I suggest going with your taste ... same thing with the sugar ... go with your personal taste ... the layers were a little difficult to figure out so here is what works ... make 3 layers ... first layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... 2nd layer is meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture (add a little nutmeg for taste), parmesan cheese ... 3rd layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... defiitely add the fennel seeds ... gives great f","This was very good. It didn't fit in my 9 x 13 pan, but worked out fine by placing part of the ingredients in a loaf pan. Caution: skip the tablespoon of salt! (Have you EVER heard of a recipe that calls for a full tablespoon?) Between the cheeses and the canned tomato products, no additional salt was needed. This recipe would easily be a base for your favorite additions: spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, etc. Other reviewers were absolutely correct: plan to make this the day before serving. It makes all the difference in the blending of flavors and incredible taste. I served this with homemade cheese bread and a crisp green salad.","I am giving this 5 stars b/c all of my friends liked it and asked me for the recipe! I made this for my women's group holiday dinner. I would personally give it 4 stars. It was a bit too meaty for me and there didn't seem to be enough ricotta (but I know a lot of peopele don't like ricotta anyways). I followed a couple reviewer's suggestions and soaked the noodles in a large roasting pan (try it -there is plenty of room to allow the noodles to lay flat) in VERY hot tap water for about 30 minutes. I added the browned meat / garlic / onion mixture to the tomatoes, paste, sauce, seasonings, etc. WITHOUT simmering. I assembled the lasagna the evening before (sauce, 6 noodles, ricotta, mozzarella slices, sauce, Parmesan, exact same layer again and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and rest of Parm). I purchased a 1 lb. package of sliced mozzarella and ended up using all of it (and it turned out fine). Also purchased mild Italian sausage (not the sweet stuff - couldn't find it). Be sure to use fresh parsley. It gives the dish nice color and adds a fresh taste that you won't get from the dried stuff. Also, be sure to add fennel seed. It really adds nice flavor to the dish. Leftovers were yummy. I took some to my parents, and my mom had one square. My dad ate the other 4! This one's a keeper, and is worthy of all stars because of the compliments - and shortcuts. Try them, they REALLY, REALLY work!. Thanks!","What a great lasagna. Thank you John Chandler for this recipe. After reading several of the reviews I did make some minor changes. I increased the ground beef to 1-1/4 lb, reduced the sugar to 1 Tbsp, reduced the salt to 1 tsp and only cooked 9 lasagna noodles. I made the sauce the day before, simmering it for about 5 hours and stored it in the fridge overnight. I assembled the dish the following morning, put it back in the fridge until ready to cook and serve. Cooked at 350, covered with foil, for about 1-3/4 hours and then another 15 minutes uncovered. The 9 lasagna noodles were just right for three layers in a 9x13 pan. This recipe makes twice as much sauce as you need. I froze the rest and will use it to make this recipe again. You reallllly should try this recipe if you are looking for an excellent lasagna.","Having grown up in a family of excellent Italian cooks, I admit I am a ""tough room"" when it comes to Italian recipes. Despite that, this one is so good that I am sure my mother and grandmother are smiling down from heaven in approval! I saw this same recipe on another site and it only called for 1 teaspoon of salt, not 1 tablespoon. It came out perfect with the lower amount of salt. It also did not call for any salt in the ricotta. I have some recommendations, below: Cut down the water to 1/4 cup. It makes a slightly thicker sauce and I felt the lasagna holds up better that way (although this recipe is good even with more water). Use half parmesan and half romano cheese. It gives a slightly more robust flavor. Put a few tablespoons of the romano/parmesan cheese in with the ricotta mixture. Add a half teaspoon of grated nutmeg in with the ricotta mixture. Increase to one teaspoon of fennel seed. Use 23 ounces of ricotta instead of 16. Use bulk sausage meat if you can find it. Otherwise if you buy link sausage make sure to remove it from the casing and mix it with the ground beef. And finally (and this is very important), make the sauce the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. The sauce tastes better and better as it sits and develops more richness of body and flavor. Trust me, all of these changes will improve the recipe! Mangia!",This truly is the best lasagne. I made it for a family party and everyone raved! I used spicy turkey sausage along with the ground beef and let the sauce simmer for about 4 hours. This will definately be my regular lasagne recipe!,"Great recipe! On the meat sauce, I followed a compilation of other reviewers’ suggestions: reduced salt and sugar by one-half, subbed fresh basil for dried basil, and kept the fennel seeds. On the ricotta mixture, I went to the Italian supermarket deli counter and got homemade ricotta. The only other modification to the ricotta mixture was a couple shakes of nutmeg to the ricotta. I also increased the mozzarella cheese slices and grated Parmesan cheese to a little over 1 pound each. I also soaked the lasagna noodles in hot tap water for 30 minutes before assembling the lasagna. It’s a great step saver, however, my cooked lasagna seemed a little “dry” because the noodles soaked up more liquids. Next time, I will increase the meat sauce to 2 cups per layer. So, this is how I divided the ingredients: 8 cups of meat sauce divided b 4; lasagna noodles divided by 3; ricotta mixture divided by 2; mozzarella slices divided by 3; grated parmesan cheese divided by 3. This is how I layered the pan starting with the bottom most layer and working to the top: meat sauce/noodles/ricotta/mozzarella/meat sauce/parm cheese/noodles/ricotta/mozzarella/meat sauce/parm cheese/noodles/meat sauce/mozzarella/parm cheese.","Great recipe, I'll be making this again and again. And finally, I found a lasagna that doesn't fall apart on a plate but isn't dry either! I read a lot of the reviews before deciding on how I was going to make this for the first time. I made the following changes: 1) used 1 lb of ground beef plus the sausage, 2) added a can crushed tomatoes to the sauce to make it a little heartier 3) substituted red wine for the water (wow did that improve the flavor!) 4) added only 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to the sauce 5) doubled the Italian Seasoning 6) omitted the fennel (don't like it) 7)used 1 lb of mozzarella cheese 8) added 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 8) cooked the noodles by placing them in hot water for 30 mins (worked well, they turn out perfect) 9) used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh stuff. The two things I wish I'd have known prior to making this: use the deepest dish you can find or you won't fit all the layers, and if you like the white cheezy part of the lasagna, you'll definitely need to double the ingredients for the ricotta cheese mixture. The recipe makes barely enough to fully cover my 9 X 13 dish. Hope this helps! Happy cooking!","I am going to write mt first review ever on this board, and it is for this recipe. I am from the mother country Italy, and this is the closest recipe to ones like home I have found. If you want to try a real italian lasagna, this is the one. The sauce is the key and would be great on anything. I added more garlic, but that was it. My family and friends thought this was a old secret family recipe. It is now and they will never know.","Absolutely the BEST lasagna I have ever made! Per others' suggestions, I made the following changes: 1) used brown suger instead of white 2) used fresh basil instead of dried 3) used red wine instead of water 4)didn't boil the noodles...just soaked them in hot water while the sauce was cooking. 5) added a couple dashes of nutmeg to the ricotta cheese mixture 6) used shredded mozarella instead of slices. This recipe makes A LOT of sauce. I had about 2 cups left over even after I was generous with it in my layering. My boyfriend LOVED it and said it's the best he's ever had. I didn't find it all that 'labor intensive' to make considering it is lasagna! Thanks for this recipe!","Believe it, everyone. This lasagna is amazing! I served it tonight to at a dinner party and all my guests raved and went back for seconds! I read all the reviews before I started cooking and here's what I did to the recipe to make it extra yummy - 1. I used a lb. of Italian sausage and 1 1/2 lbs. of lean ground beef. 2. I chopped a medium onion instead of using minced onion. 3. I used six cloves of garlic instead of two. 4. I used a 1/2 c. of red wine instead of water. 5. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. 6. I used fresh chopped basil and fresh chopped parsley instead of dried. 7. I used 1 teaspoon of salt. 8. I doubled the ricotta. 9. I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to my ricotta mixture. 10. I grated a lb. of mozzarella cheese instead of using sliced mozzarella. Even though this recipe is a little time consuming, it's absolutely worth it!! This is the only lasagna recipe I will ever use from now on!!","With all of the reviewers' suggestions, this recipe is definitely 5 star. As written, it could use a few improvements. Here is what I did (following others' suggestions in their reviews): - Soak noodles in very hot tap water for up to 30 mins while prepping sauce/ricotta mixture. - Use 1lb ground beef (they sell sweet Italian sausage at Trader Joe's, but I've used pork sausage with sweet chilis and that works, too). - Drain excess liquid after browning meat and before adding onions and garlic, then cook until onions are soft before adding the other ingredients to the sauce. - 6 cloves garlic instead of 2. - Only 6 oz tomato paste, instead of 12oz. - 1 Tablespoon of sugar instead of 2, and 1 teaspoon of salt (instead of 1 Tblsp). - 1/3 cup fresh basil instead of dried, if you have it (dried is fine otherwise). - 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. - Add 1 Tblsp parmesan and a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture. - I've used both sliced mozz and fresh mozz - both work great. - Layer as follows (from bottom to top): 2 c meat sauce / 6 noodles (overlap them) / 1/2 ricotta mixture / 2 c meat sauce / 1/4 c parmesan / 1/2 of the mozzarella / 2 c meat sauce / 6 noodles / remaining ricotta mixture / 2 c meat sauce / remaining mozzarella / remaining parmesan. - Cover and refrigerate overnight. - Let sit at room temp for an hour before baking. Everything else in the recipe that I haven't mentioned, I followed as written. The lasagna got rave reviews and disappeared","The very best I've ever made . . . with a few changes to the sauce - red wine instead of water, omit the sugar & salt & add 1/2 tsp cinnamon (from my Italian Nona). Save time & energy by replacing the cooked lasagna noodles with layers of uncooked won ton wrappers which are basically an uncooked noodle. No one will know the difference except to say how great it is because the noodles are not so thick.","Like many I have a very good lasagna recipe that I have used for years. Once in a while it's fun to change it up. I've tried a couple of the well rated others here but nothing was a great improvement over mine. I had thought this recipe was one I had tried, but it wasn't. This is simply fabulous. The sausage is wonderful in the sauce, subtle but noticeable. The fennel is another added flavour hint making the sauce taste homemade and unique. I like everything as is but do agree that the salt could be cut. I must commend the reviewers who explained how to build 3 layers. Now why didn't I think of that?? Liking the taste of regular lasagna pasta noodles over ""oven ready"" I have been using the soak in hot water method for a long time and would never do it any other way. Thanks so much for this wonderful addition to my menu","This was excellent and the sauce had a wonderful flavor! I mostly stuck to the recipe, except it calls for way too much salt. I only used one tsp. Also, when layering the lasagna, you need three layers of noodles (4 ea) to fit the divided ricotta mixture in between. 2 layers wouldn't even work. I used 1/4 of the sauce on the bottom, in between the layers and on top. These are very small changes about only the salt and assembly which I feel are mistakes in the recipe. Also, an ordinary, shallow 13x9 pan would be too small for this. I used a spacious lasagna pan. Thanks for the recipe!","This was awesome. I will only make lasagna this way from now on. Not that my dad's wasn't the best and he is from Italy but this is the recipe I will hand down to my kids. I only made a couple changes and they weren't even that big. I used about 1.4 lbs of meat and I used 1.25 lbs of sweet italian sausage and instead of 28oz of crushed tomatoes I used 14oz and used 14 oz of diced italian tomatoes seasoned with garlic, basil, and oregano. I made the night before so the flavors could marry and used no boil noodles. This is def traditional italian lasagna. Nothing american about this one. It's a must try.UPDATE The no boil noodles didn't work out so well. Just use traditional noodles and use the method of soaking them in hot water for 30 min. Works for me everytime. I also only added 1 tsp of kosher salt and not a tbl, I also added about a half a palm full of crushed red pepper flakes about a tsp to offset the sweetness. My kiddos and husband can't get enough of this. This is def money. Also the secret italian thing is to add a pinch of nutmeg to any sauce and it makes it pop. Why I don't know but my dad taught me and it has never failed me.","I have been on a long search and agree this is the best lasagna I have found. The sauce is fantastic, which is a big compliment from me as I'm very picky about my sauce. I read a lot of other people's comments. At the end of the day, I made the recipe as written except that I omitted the salt, use 1.25 pounds of ground beef, spicy italian sausage instead of sweet, and used only half the ricotta. How much ricotta you use is really up to personal taste. My view is a little goes a long ways. Several people mentioned doing it in three layers instead of two, but two took it up to the very top of the pan anyway. This recipe is great!","This is almost my exact recipe for lasagne - except I like to use hot italian sausage and add some chopped mushrooms to the sauce while it is simmering. A dash or two of a good red wine to the sauce isn't a bad addition either. This is an absolutely wonderful dish - a little time consuming, but worth every minute!!","No question this is an outstanding lasagna. I have had lasagna quite a lot in my life and this one is at the top. The secret, or not so secret, to this recipe is the sauce. I also love love love a good chicken parm and this will be the sauce I will use for my chicken parm from now on. I did make a couple changes that I don't think changed anything. One, reduce the salt content...it calls for too much. Two, use fresh herbs it worth the extra $. In building the lasagna, I tried to slash out some of the fat. It wouldn't be the same with any other meat than is called for so I went after the cheese to reduce the fat and cholesterol. I used non-fat ricotta cheese and lower fat mozz. I still went with the regular parmigiana cheese, however. Other than that I went with the recipe which I almost never do. Give this one a try if you like good dishes like this.",,,,,,,,,,,
1,I grew up on this casserole. I have made it dozens and dozens of time for my own family. Modifications .... for sure.....I added a thinly sliced onion when browning the mushrooms. I make a roux with butter and flour (I like my flour to have that nice nutty flavour that it gets when you make a roux) that step really amps up the dish. Also deglaze your fry pan with 1/2 cup of white wine and then pop the entire meal into the oven and cook on 325 for an hour. Fall off the bone tasty.,"Delicious as written! My chops were thick so I did have to cook them longer but this is an excellent recipe. With the exception of bacon, pork is my least favorite meat so for me to give 5 stars for pork says a lot.","This recipe is very good. I added fresh Italian parsley for color and a bit of mild flavor. It is pretty easy and tasty. Just boil some potatoes and serve with the sauce. This is a truly delicious dinner. I think dried or fresh thyme could be used and will be just as awesome as it it. Will make it again. Have some crusty bread to eat the remnants of sauce. Update: If you want to add some richness and body to the sauce, before adding the garlic and mushrooms, try this: add about 2tsps of white wine, deglaze the pan, and let the wine dissipate before adding the garlic and mushrooms. Yum!","Made it twice. First as directed above. The second time I used portobello mushrooms and added red onions and halved the broth amount and added white wine for the other half, and it was amazing!!!!","KEEPER! We can't wait to have this again! Just follow the recipe and you'll be happy! I did add about another 1 1/2 teaspoons of flour to the mix, but that's all I did. This is really good! Thanks, April!",I’m new to cooking and made a couple mistakes but oh man this was an amazing recipe!,"Thank you for sharing this recipe! I am always on the lookout for quick and simple recipes and this one definitely fit the bill. I made mine with 4 thin, boneless pork chops and I only added 2 cloves of garlic. I also added a small chopped Vidalia onion and man was it delicious!! My husband spooned the extra gravy over 2 grands biscuits because he liked it so much. I will most definitely make this again and plan to share it with my daughter and daughter in law.","Holy Hannah this was awe-some!! I made the recipe mostly as-is, with the exception I didn't have beef broth so I used Campbell's beef consume, it was delish. I also used baby portabello mushrooms, talk about visually appealing! ?I would cook noodles or rice to serve this on.","This turned out very nicely. The only change I made was with the mustard. I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard. The pork chops were very tender, and the sauce/gravy was delicious. The only thing I might add is onions with the mushrooms and garlic.",Made for my husband birthday dinner and he loves it!. Thank you Allrecipes,"Don't know, exactly, what I expected from this recipe, but I was a bit disappointed in it. Tasted ""ok"", at best, with me adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder- repeatedly. My husband liked it....... Guess I was expecting more with the recipe note that it was close to one served to the author, at a restaurant. Probability of making it again, are slim.",This. Is. So. Good. Highly recommend.,The taste was very enjoyable and the recipe was easy and simple to prepare.,I doubled up on the mushrooms but stuck to the recipe outside of that. The whole family loved this.,No changes and will definitely make it again.,"I always add wine of some sort, white , sherry, or even red ! fourth cup is good. Yummy gravy","excellent but as just for me for a couple of meals, cut the pork in half and kept the mushrooms the same as I love them.","This recipe was easier to make than I thought it would be, and tasted great. No leftovers. I’m not a fan of pork chops, but I get them when on sale. This is a keeper, thank you!",I followed exact directions and it was delicious everyone loves it. I had scallop home made potato’s with it and was great with the gravy!,Really good! I doubled the recipe and made extra gravy to served with mashed potatoes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"This one is a ""keeper""! My husband said he'd like it again! This stroganoff was different than the tomato-based one that I usually make, and we loved it! It has a hearty, rich flavor. I didn't have to adjust any of the seasoning, and the thickness was perfect, which doesn't always happen in a crock-pot recipe. I had all of the ingredients, and didn't change a thing. Looking forward to more recipes from Ann. Thanks, Ann!","I can't tell you how appreciative I am that pretty much all of you, save a few, love my stroganoff. I get excited every time I get notification that someone else has posted a review. I wish you all a very happy, safe, healthy, & prosperous new year!",This was wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the red wine because I didn't have any. Used water instead. I found that the sauce was a little thick but maybe some of the moisture cooked away. Will watch and maybe add some additional water next time. Flavor was fabulous! My guests loved it!! Will certainly make again. Thanks!,"L O VE D this recipe. Family is of German descent and everyone loved it. Stroganoff should be more than beef and gravy enhanced with sour cream..this truly is! Made to the recipe for a double recipe and a single recipe leaving out onions and chives. Truly didn't make a lot of difference. The red wine was the answer to a full flavor! Awesome ,.. This will be my GO TO stroganoff from now on! Thanks","I'll be honest, I have NEVER rated a recipe before online, but this was absolutely too fantastic not to rate! The only thing I added, which probably wasn't necessary, but I did anyway, was added about 3/4 can of Golden Mushroom soup. This recipe is definitely the one and only crockpot/slow cooker beef stroganoff that we will use over and over again! Thank you for posting this masterpiece!!","Recipe was delicious! Made a few modifications. Used trader joe's cream of mushroom soup and sautéed mushrooms, onions and garlic in butter, then added red wine and reduced until thickened. Still added red wine called for in recipe to stroganoff sauce. Best stroganoff I've ever made....thank you cwmom98.","This was okay, but I guess I was expecting more, considering all the ingredients that went into. However, I did make the mistake of adding 1/3 too much sour cream because I read the directions wrongly. Then when I taste-tested it, I found it to be quite bland, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon of extra worchestershire sauce. In the end, it still didn't have quite as much flavor as I was hoping it would. I think I'll go back to my much more simple and much more flavorful stroganoff recipe, which is basically just some sour cream mixed with a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.","The Wine, Cream Cheese, and Chives really set the recipe apart from the meager fare so often associated with an easy dish. This is worth keeping, and really enjoy it!","Instead of using mushroom soup, I used Golden Mushroom. Otherwise, I followed this recipe to a T. By far, the best Stroganoff I have ever had. It was, well, super duper. :-)","This is an absolutely fantastic recipe. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful. If you have time, there are a few things you can do to make it even better. I seared the cubes of chuck in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a bit of vegetable oil until each piece had a nice brown crust (Don't buy ""stew meat"" in the package if it's more expensive per pound than a chuck roast, it only takes a few minutes to trim and cube it yourself.) I transferred the browned meat to the slow cooker and reduced the heat to medium. I tossed in a couple tablespoons of butter and added the onions and a pinch of salt. Once the onions are soft and taking on some color, I tossed in the mushrooms and cooked them until they release their moisture and then get nicely browned. I then deglazed pan with the wine, and poured the mushrooms, onions, and wine to the cooker. The only other change I made was mixing the cornstarch and flour with water instead of the wine, since I used the wine for deglazing the pan. The result was even better than the first time I made it, so the extra steps are worth it, but this is super delicious if you just throw everything in the slow cooker. I served this mixed with some old-fashioned egg noodles, and it was to die for!","This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and both stepkids and husband loved it. Do yourself a favor and don't deviate from the recipe-- there's no need to! When I make this again I will double the recipe, as everyone was fighting over the small portion of what was left over. :-)",Very good! Thank you! I did increase the amount of meat and used sirloin. Baby Bella’s are amazing in this dish! Even better the next day.,"Very good, I would like to see something other than canned soup used, but otherwise good","Made this last night. My husband actually stopped eating to look at me and say, ""This is REALLY good. Thank you!"" So we will definitely have this again. Great recipe, thank you for sharing it.",I made this exactly as described and we loved it. Next time I will double the recipe so there is more leftovers.,"Very good! Beef was tender, sauce was super creamy, and the wine and worcestershire sauce added a well-rounded flavor. I even screwed up and cooked on high for 7 hours and it still turned out GREAT! Served over egg noodles. Yummy!","Spectacular. Made it just as the recipe said and it was phenomenal, full of flavor, beef was perfectly cooked, creamy and thick sauce. Just awesome! Thank you!!",No mushrooms . No wine I use beef broth,"Fantastic dish, juicy tender beef with a rich, creamy, complex sauce. Don't change a thing, excellent recipe just as it is. Thank you from the bottom of my taste buds. I will definitely be adding this to repertoire of winter comfort food meals.",Loved it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,This works well for certain ovens. Here is the fool proof plan! After your calculated 500 degree blast turn off the oven. In 30 minutes check the oven temp by setting it to bake at 325 degrees. If your oven is below 325 and begins to heat up your oven either has a vent fan or cools off too quickly. No problem. Set it to 275 and leave it for the next hour. You are now at 1.5 hours after the blast. Turn oven off for the last half hour. Perfection. If your oven is over 325 one half hour after the first half hour blast you should be good with original recipe.,"This is a fool proof method for making the best medium rare prime rib. Your seasonings can be changed according to your preference, but what's listed works perfectly. It's the cooking method that is the key. It cannot be stressed enough, the roast MUST be at room temperature in order for this to work. If it is the least bit cold in the middle of the roast, you will come out with a very rare roast. A mistake I only made once because I was worried about leaving it out to get warm. Don't worry! It will be fine! I usually purchase 4.5 to 5 lb roasts and take it out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to be sure it is room temp. It comes out absolutely PERFECT and juicy every time.","I know this is a culinary no-no, but we don't link pink meat, so while I partially use this method, I didn't do it exactly as Chef John suggests. I had a 4 lb boneless rib roast, which I let sit out at room temp for 4 hours. While the meat was coming to room temp I also let my butter sit out to soften. I placed the butter in a small bowl, added about 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, 4 tsp of coarse kosher salt, 2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 6 minced garlic cloves, and 2 tsp of thyme. (We don't care for Herbs de Provence.) I mixed this up with a fork then slathered the meat all over with it. I roasted the meat for 20 minutes at 500 degrees to get a nice crust, then I reduced the oven temp to 325 and continued roasting for another two hours. This gave us meat which was almost well done. It was still absolutely delicious this way, and perfectly flavored and juicy. Served with some twice baked potatoes and green beans. Perfect meal!","I have used this recipe for years and it works perfectly- ONE THING that will cause the meat to be less than medium rare, besides not having the rib at room temperature, is the fan in newer ovens!! I had no issue for many years until I got a new oven in 2012. Many new ovens have a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off. It quickly lowers the temp, which, obviously, will not work for this recipe. Since I have a built-in oven, I actually shut off the breaker to the oven so the fan doesn't come on. Otherwise you can just unplug it. I guarantee that was the problem with folks who had theirs come out rare!","I was really skeptical - I'm a thermometer checker with my meats and keeping the oven off for two hours with the door closed about killed me! I had a 7 pound prime rib roast and with the exception of the seasoning (I make my own), I followed the recipe exactly as written - roasting at 500 degrees for 35 minutes and then oven off for 2 hours. Turned out perfect. My husband was beyond impressed. I also made Chef John's Beef Au Jus. A meal my entire family loved. Thank you!","I wish there was an ability to give 10 stars! Chef John, I followed your directions... (except I was all out of Kosher salt so I only used sea salt, dang it)...and I got rave reviews. Due to having big eaters and more people than normal, I made an 11.13 pound rib roast and the directions worked for that big of an item. I couldn't believe it. Thank you so much. I have deleted the other prime/rib roast from my recipe box and now only have yours. Words cannot express my gratitude.","Absolutely, the easiest way to make perfect prime rib every time. But do not be tempted to open up the oven door until time is up.","OMG .. I have never been able to do Prime Rib correctly and I finally cracked it using this recipe. Thank you thank you thank you! The only alteration I made was to do the math (# of lbs by 5 mins per lb) and then I added about 5 extra minutes to the total time (ie my roast needed 19.5 mins in the 500 F oven, and I did it for 25 mins) this was simply because I wanted some meat on the outside edge closer to medium (for me) and medium rare inside for hubby. The plan worked to perfection and gave us exactly what we wanted for a fantastic New Years Eve dinner. I have never been a huge fan of prime rib and this recipe has won me over. I'll prepare this again and again, a big hit! (I might cut back on the pepper next time, but this wasn't a huge issue, just personal preference I also made Chef John's Au Jus to go with this and it was incredible; like liquid gold as my husband said! )","Prime rib was perfect, juicy and perfectly pink. Followed the recipe exactly with a 4 lb prime rib. Loved it! Love the video to really get a good sense of how to apply the butter and herbs. I'll be trying more of your recipes in the near future for sure!","I've never written a review here before, but I just had to for this. Today I cooked a 6.2 lb rib and it was perfect. The only thing different that I did was to use fresh Rosemary and Thyme, minced, and 10 cloves of garlic, minced, in the butter. I didn't have Herbs de Provence, and did have the fresh herbs, so that's what I used. I'd seen the garlic idea from the Garlic Prime Rib recipe on this website. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly! We do a rib for Christmas every year and before, it was a shoot, it seemed, as to whether the roast would come out medium rare or too done. This recipe has changed that for good!! The hardest part was not opening the door until the 2 hours was done. Otherwise, it was easy peasy! And SO good. I've attached a picture. Thank you so much for giving us a foolproof way to perfectly cook a standing rib! As a few others have said, I'd give it more stars if I could.","UPDATE: Christmas 2019 and I'm trying this method in a brand new oven. I forgot to disable my smoke detectors, but the brand new oven door is sealed well. Still do not have a high-temp meat thermometer but again, with a brand new oven, 500 should be true. My roast was 4.03lbs so 21 minutes then 2hrs in 'off' oven. The roast is perfect!","Love this recipe. But, I need such a big roast that I'm using two in the same oven. Does anyone know if I'm to use the roast time formula for just one of the two (they're both approximately same weight)?","I made this recipe last night for our Christmas Eve dinner. I must say that I was extremely nervous because I prepared a 14.7 pound 5 rib roast! Even though the recipe claims that the ""math"" is the trick, I was concerned that putting my roast in for 74 minutes at 500 was going to burn the outside. Well, just to let you all know, it was perfect! I was amazed! My family was definitely enjoying the meal. Thank you for making me look like a pro. :)","I had a great result. Preheated to 500...(hint to the one that complained of a smoking oven, a clean oven should prevent this, I learned the hard way lol.) My roast was exactly 5 lbs. 5x5=25 and I added 5 minutes to err to the side of caution. Solid 2 hours later, removed from oven, set aside and lightly covered in foil while I made the ""jus"" that he also has a recipe for here. The meat was a perfect tender pink throughout and just delicious. The jus took it over the top. This was my first prime rib but it sure won't be my last. I couldn't have asked for a better result.","This is a perfect recipe. My roast was almost 8# bone in....I stuck slivers of garlic in the top, rubbed it with soft butter, crushed garlic & rosemary....then topped that with kosher salt! I will never cook this any other way!","We just did 3 18 lb standing rib roasts for a catering gig and people couldn't say enough positive things about this. Used my secret blend of spices but followed roasting directions and was the most tender, moist, evenly coked medium rare prime I have done in ages. Was a little afraid that wouldn't work with roasts this size, but a dream! Thanks, Chef John, you saved my bacon!","My family celebrated Thanksgiving with my wife's sister, while I shivered and shook with with some kind of crud. On Friday I followed the recipe and technique and was able to present a very good prime rib for the family. Our oven is a good gas unit and the meet was a bit undercooked for all but me. The next time I will increase the minutes at 500 degrees and make some changes in the seasoning. Tonight the leftover roast is simmering in the stock pot with potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and onions for a great beef stew for the family.","Our family actually learned this same method of cooking prime rib at 500 degrees, multiplying the weight by 5 for the minutes to cook, etc. from our butcher in Indiana back in the 1980s. Needless to say, this method has been around a while. This recipe never fails and has served us well with Prime Rib for over twenty years...it's amazingly accurate and delicious.","I would truly love to give this the 5 Star Rating I was expecting to give when placing my two 8# roasts in the oven on Christmas Day. Unfortunately after the 2 hours we pretty much had raw beef on our plates. The flavor was great (I knew enough not to attempt butter at such a high temp for that long) and there was plenty of salt/seasoning adhering to the roasts so that wasn't a concern. The Au Jus turned out too salty ~ I wish I'd thought to use some wine to mellow it out before serving although noone other than myself seemed to think it was salty. I can only conclude that the meat must have NOT been as room temperature as I thought it was after hours of sitting out. I will make it a point of trying this method again with another rib roast and plug in a remote reader digital thermometer to watch the interior temp during that 2 hours. Good excuse for making another roast for my birthday, right? In our house, we choose our special dinner entree (or restaurant...) hee...hee.... I'd love to be able to revise this rating with a 5. I'm giving it a 4 only because I'm assuming it was something I did that kept it so rare. Chef John, if you have any comments about roasting 2 separate same weight cuts of roast at the same time, please let me know. There was enough separation between them to allow for heat circulation ~ I'm just stumped.",I was really nervous making this. First time I tried to make prime rib a few years ago using a thermometer I ruined a 143.00 rib roast. ( over cooked) so I watched Chef Johns video and printed out the recipe and proceeded to follow it to the letter. This was AMAZING!!!! I could not believe how great this was. My mother loved it. My daughter and her fiancé really enjoyed it too. Thank you so Much Chef John you've just gotten yourself another fan. I let the roast sit out for 6 hrs as suggested. And did the math for a roast that was 9.22 lbs. the hardest part was not opening the oven door. What a great way to make the perfect rib roast.. I did pull it out 15 min earlier because it was a big roast and was afraid if the bones got to hot might over cook. It was perfect. Pink moist and delicious. Also made the beef au jus from his other video. So easy and made me feel like a culinary king.. Thanks again Chef John...,"I tried this recipe on Xmas Day 4 years ago after I read a dozen reviews so I made a couple of adjustments. First, I did leave my roast out of the refrig for 6 hours before I cooked it. Take your roast out at 9:30AM, wait 6 hours. I started cooking at 4PM for a 7 lb 1 oz roast (bone in) that I ran longer than the prescribed time. The calculation would have dictated 35 minutes at 500 degrees, I added 4 minutes for a total of 39 minutes and it came out a PERFECT MEDIUM (hot pink, very slight red center, with the outside being close to well done but nice and crisp). Roast was on the table at 6:45PM. During the afternoon I prepped the rest of my meal easily. For me, I have now used this 4 more times since then as of Dec 1, 2017 with the following formula: 5.3 minutes for every pound of meat (bone in). I have gotten a perfect hot light red/pink center with no blood every time (now 5 times). Perfect outside color and even a bit warm when served after sitting 2-3 minutes before carving. I have roasted sizes between 5.6 lbs through 8.4 lbs without a problem - can't speak for anything smaller or larger than this size. You MUST get your roast to room temperature before cooling for this timing and oven setting to work. Also, if you don't watch the video, roast your meat with the ""bones down"" so the top fat layer crusts and gets crispy because it is exposed to the searing of your hot oven elements. I hope this refinement of the recipe helps people avoid the undercooking that","Ok I had a 20.14 lb prime rib big one I was so worried. I followed the receipt along with the seasoning and cook time, yes had to do some math to figure it out 1hr and 30min in the oven at 500° shut it off and did not open till 2 hrs 30 min, yes house filled up with smoke had to disable the fire alarms. Prime rib came out perfect so delicious and medium rare. Rave reviews I had to share.","This is a great recipe....and I love the method. I used some crushed garlic in my butter compound and also added a bit of olive oil to bring up the smokepoint. At 500 degrees, butter smokes in my oven....but it is a bearable amount and if you have good ventilation, the results are well worth it! Because I have a smaller electric oven, it cools a bit too quickly for this recipe. (which I knew going into it and the Chef's instructions are quite clear about a full size oven). After my sear time of 5 minutes a pound, I reduced the cooking temp to 250 degrees. Since I did not turn the oven off completley, I also let it rest about 20 minutes before carving. I took a nine pound roast out at 134 degrees and it rose to 136 over about 20 minutes. Meat was perfect. Great recipe and easy to make!","Despite being skeptical, I made this for Christmas Dinner. I put a rub of butter and Montreal Steaak Seasoning instead of Herbs de Provance. 4.5 roast, 22 minutes at 500, then l hr and 40 minutes until the therm. read 130. I took it out then as I didn't want to overcook it. It was perfect. I had enough drippings to make a thin gravy. I let it sit out overnight and the internal temperature was 63. I put bunjie cords on the oven door so I didn't open it by mistake. It was amazing to me that the meat actually cooked with the oven off. It was beautifully pink. I will use this recipe from now on. I can always rely on a recipe from Chef John.","This 78-year old (79 in eleven more days!) cook has made many rib roasts in her day. This is the third time I have used Chef John's fail-proof method for preparing a rib roast and every one (from 3-6 lbs.) has been PERFECT. I have been a bit more adventurous with my seasonings than the recipe calls for and the taste has been miraculous! My almost 75-year husband thinks he has died and gone to heaven each time I've made this meal! But it is the 5-minute per pound rule that is priceless! There is absolutely NO guess work, you don't need a meat thermometer and the results are great each time. I will never again make a prime rib with any other method!!!! Thank you so much, Chef John, for this recipe and the many other recipes that I've ""borrowed"" from you. You make me look good in the cooking department!! (People seem to think I can cook!) ;-)","I really wanted to love this. I followed the recipe to the letter. Like another reviewer experienced, my smoke alarms went off which always scares all of us. (Especially the dogs with their super hearing) After 2 hours when I took it out, it was way, WAY too rare. The only part that was cooked was the outside of it. It also still had that wiggly consistency. Had to cook it again the next day. Was really awful, and we both like rare-ish roast beef! Will never make this recipe again. Sorry Chef. Just wasn't edible to us and creeped me out looking at it.",First time I didn't have to worry about a thing! Perfect!! Thank you Chef John!!,,,,,,,,,
4,"As y'all will do, I made some slight changes. I used an entire box of beef stock (4 cups) and baby portabellas (they were on sale); Omitted the salt, went heavy on the pepper, garlic and added roughly 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce on HP for 30 mins. And heck yeah I used 1/2 the sour cream in favor of full fat cream cheese: We're EATIN here! Served with some nuked string beans on Styrofoam plates with buttered wonder bread.","This was very good, but could be better still. I used a whole onion, Worcestershire instead of soy sauce and beef broth instead of chicken, and stirred in the noodles when adding. Next time I will add more garlic and salt. DO NOT ADD FLOUR UNTIL VERY END OF COOKING! It can be dangerous to add thickeners prior to the pressure cooking stage. Wait until after the pressure cooking is done, then add the thickener and use saute setting to cook down the sauce a little.","I can only fairly give this four stars as written, but with two important changes, I believe it goes right up to a five star recipe. In place of the chicken broth, sub in beef broth. Second, skip the soy sauce and use Worcestershire sauce instead. When you add the egg noodles, stir them in to the dish, don't just pour them on top and leave them there. The instructions are not very clear on this as written. When you make these few changes, this is a delicious meal for sure!","Made this for dinner tonight. I followed the recipe exactly. It OK, not wow great. The next time I will incorporate some of the changes others have made - beef broth not chicken & Worcestershire sauce instead of soy. I think both of those will help give it more depth. I'm also going to flour the meat prior to browning. The recipe itself is poorly written & a bit hard to follow when it comes to the cooking time. You don't need to time how long it takes to come to full pressure, just how long it cooks at full pressure. So the steps about 10 minutes, then 10 minutes at high pressure - just confusing & unnecessary.","What a great one pot dish. Of course everyone will make some changes. Here’s what we did: 1 Add 4 ounces of cream cheese to the finish, decreasing the sour cream a little; 2 Used two tablespoons cornstarch as a thickening agent ; 3 Lots of freshly ground pepper-we added a lot; 4 Next time we will add Worcester Sauce, probably two tablespoons ; 5 We used beef stock instead of chicken . This made our “to keep” file. We will surely make it again","This meal is the 5th meal I’ve made with my pot. Changes I made - 2.5 pounds of meat, beef broth (just made sense), and Worcestershire (because SO many reviews said so). Next time I will just brown my meat in another pan because there was too much meat to brown efficiently in the pot. I also changed the order up a smidge based on my experiences so far. I started cooking the onion first, then browned meat, then added spices. Removed the meat mix (to be sure I was able to see the bottom) and deglazed with the beef broth. Added back the meat and mushrooms (sliced), stirred, and pressured. I did NOT add flour (because I had a prior burn experience with flour), but chose to thicken with a few tablespoons of cornstarch (tempered, of course) after the noodles cooked. When I started pressurizing the first, I was skeptical that there would be room for noodles but I waited to make a decision until It was done with the first pressure cycle. It had cooked down to under the halfway mark, even when I added in about 8 ounces of noodles. My bag was 12 ounces but I boiled about a third of the package plain on the stove for my littles. This was delicious and only took me about 10 minutes longer than the listed time, which is saying a lot about the accuracy of the recipe because I am VERY slow in the kitchen! I highly recommend this recipe (definitely at least with the change to leave out the flour and thicken at the end!)","AMAZING. I love beef stroganoff and have tried several recipes in the past. This one wins! I subbed worcestershire for soy sauce only because we were out of soy sauce, and beef broth instead of chicken broth since it made more sense to me.... and it was DEEELISH!!! Will make again and again. And SO EASY.","I used a whole box of chicken stock and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some Worcestershire sauce to the original recipe. It was my first time using the Instant Pot and I was unprepared for the huge splatter with the quick pressure release...make sure to put a tea towel over the release valve otherwise you’ll have sauce sprayed everywhere! Other than that though, it came our really well. Everyone thought it was very tasty.","This was fantastic. I’m not sure why others shared it had no flavor. It was flavored beautifully- if you follow the recipe. We used the chicken broth and worscestershire sauce combo. And only used 1/2 the called for thyme. When I added the noodles I also added 1/2 C more broth and I placed the timing for 4 minutes and let it naturally decompress for 2 minutes 30, then unleashed the valve. The noodles came out perfect. I’ll make this again and again.","New favorite Instant Pot recipe! Like many other reviewers, I substituted Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce, and beef for chicken broth. I left out the thyme (didn't have it, didn't miss it) and mushrooms (they're gross). I also doubled the sour cream... Because my love affair with dairy knows no bounds.","I've never been a huge fan of beef stroganoff but this recipe has changed all of that. It has become a favorite and we make it about once a month. The flavor is incredible and it is so easy to make. If you do not have chicken broth, use a heaping tablespoon of ""Better Than Bouillon"" in 3 cups of hot water. There is one flaw in the recipe. There isn't enough liquid to cook the noodles properly. After putting the noodles in, pat them down a little and then add about 2 more cups of hot water. The amount of water will depend on what type of noodles you use and you may have to do a little trial and error with it. It took us a couple of times to get it just right. We use dried egg noodles so 2-3 cups of water is usually enough. A couple of reviews have said to stir the noodles into the mix after you add them. DO NOT stir the noodles in until you are ready to add the sour cream. They will burn and stick to the bottom. Adding the extra water will allow the noodles to cook properly without burning or sticking and it will still have the right consistency. If you want to add a little more zing to it, serve it with some shredded cheese on top.",One small detail left out ... STIR IN the egg noodles. Too Bad.,"-Only use half the noodles. The full amount is too much -Don't add ANY of the salt. There is plenty of salt in the other ingredients. +Add 2 TB of Worchestire sauce +/- Substitute beef broth for chicken broth +Add cooking time both before and after the noodles. I found the listed time way too short - the meat was tough when I added the noodles. I cooked the noodles for a total of 15 min, not 5. I had tender meat at the end, but next time I will increase the initial cook time, plus cut the meat much smaller. 1-inch cubes are odd to eat.","Followed the directions exactly, except for a couple of modifications suggested by other reviewers: used beef broth (a 4 cup carton) instead of 3 cups of chicken broth, and used worcestershire instead of soy sauce. It was delicious and I can't imagine it without the worcestershire. Oh, one other slight difference: I used a 12 oz. bag of extra wide noodles instead of a 16 oz. bag, and it was plenty of noodles. As for the process, I did follow that exactly. After reading one review I was a little nervous about throwing the flour in there as directed to thicken, but it was fine. Do be prepared to clean the valve of your IP well, though, because the sauce sputtered through it on the quick release. Even with the extra broth and less noodles, the liquid didn't quite cover the noodles. When time was up, they looked a little underdone where they weren't covered. I stirred the pot and covered it again for a couple of minutes and everything was fine. The sauce was a perfect consistency to coat the noodles, and the meat was tender and flavorful.","I used a whole onion and probably more mushrooms than called for, and it turned out perfect. Definitely on my ""do this again soon"" list. Froze 1/2 before adding Sour Cream for future use.","After reading other reviews I made the following changes: used whole onion, used 2 cans of beef broth in place of chicken,used Worcestershire sauce in place of soy, used two eight oz boxes of baby bells which I sliced. Cooked meat and onions and spices 15 minutes, added twelve oz bag of egg noodles which I stirred into the meat mixture and cooked five minutes, added two tablespoons of flour to mixture and cooked on sauté setting for several minutes, turned off and added sour cream which I stirred in thoroughly. WOW!! The noodles tender and well flavored, the beef was tender and well cooked. My first attempt with the instant pot and it blew my wife and I away. Will be trying other new dishes soon and coming back to this one often.","While this tasted good….used a whole box of beef broth, 2T worcestershire sauce and 2T cornstarch, 12 oz noodles…..the presentation was Brown, capital B. The parsley helped but maybe some diced carrots next time?","Added paprika since that's kinda traditional with stroganoff, turned out amazing! I'll definitely make this again but will try it with the beef broth and Worcestershire the next time. First full recipe in my pressure cooker so it took some figuring to get it to temp but once I did I was on my way","Excellent. I left out the mushrooms to appease the family. Also,I subbed Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce.","Made this recipe exactly as written and I thought it was delicious! Very good flavor, meat was tender and noodles were perfect! Will definitely make again.","This was my first use of a pressure cooker. I really loved how tender the meat was. I might cut back on the salt next time, but there will definitely be a ""next time"" for this recipe!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,This is a delicious summer dish! It smells amazing on the bbq. I paired it with cilantro lime rice and a nice white wine on a summer night - yum! I took the chefs advice and used the jumbo shrimp. A good idea if you are making this as a main dish. Will definitely make this again.,My husband loved it. Will be making again and again.,This was fabulous! Made lime cilantro rice to go with it.,"Don't know if I did something wrong but after cooking, it tasted like the shrimp had a pasty texture to them. Flavor was good and the grilled pineapple was excellent.","I can't say that I loved it, But, It was very good",Very disappointed. Recipe was easy but tasteless. It definitely needed something to kick up the taste. Won’t make again.,I made it according to the recipe and it was delicious,"No changes, did mine on grill , have a covered deck. Smells good in winter.",great service,"Like one of the other commenters stated, the larger the size of the shrimp is better for a skewer but you can go as low as 31-40 count size. I have done it with 51-60 count but you need to put a lot more shrimp on the skewer (almost double), plus the smaller size shrinks to tiny shrimp when cooked. Great for the grill this recipe or the oven.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,this was my absolute favorite meal I have made in a long time.,Dish was so good!! I didn’t have any poblano peppers so I didn’t use them. My kids don’t like spicy foods so it was fine. I also didn’t have pork so I used hamburger. I think it would have been good either way. I ate it alone but you could put it in tacos shells or burritos and would be great. Thanks for sharing!!,Had to add additional broth to finish cooking the rice. Adding the salsa and corn caused the meal to cool off too much. Had to microwave. Overall was good.,"One of my 2020 New Years goal is to try a new recipe each week. So I started with this one! I’ll make again. I’ll try it with brown rice next time, and I’ll throw in a can of black beans too!",When do you cook the corn?,"It was very good, i love pork chops, but this is amazing",Awesome recipe and very tasty dish. Wife and Father-in-law approved meal. :),This is a very simple recipe and has good flavor even when heated up. And it is mostly cooked in one skillet. Loved it!,"The whole family enjoyed it, and it was easy to make.",I was worried about the rice cooking in the oven. The rice cooked perfectly. The recipe was full of flavor and I can’t wait to make it again. I did cut the recipe in half for 2 people and we were full.,"Super easy & delicious! Used ground beef instead of ground pork. Made this for the adults. And, made a second batch but omitted the poblanos for the kids since the poblanos gave it a pretty good amount of heat/kick.",good - had a personal problem - I didn't turn oven from broil to bake. took forever until I figured that out.,"I made it using ground chicken sausage and it was delicious!! And so easy to make. I also didn't roast the peppers, because I forgot, and just added them in to bake with the mix. It was still great!","My husband dove into this before I could take a photo. It was delicious. He said the salsa added so much brightness and added flavor. Next time I’d double the salsa. I used a SouthWest veggie combo by Birdseye ( or Green Giant ??) with cirn, black beans and peppers. It was perfect. I made the poblanos but did not use as I did not like the taste. I will try this again with chicken or ground beef. But definitely the pork again! We loved it","This recipe is so forgiving it's worth noting how easy it is to adapt. I didn't have roasted corn, so I used plain frozen corn. I also added a can of black beans, a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chilis, instead of fresh, because I had it all in the pantry. All this went in before it went into the oven. I also used jarred salsa to top it. It was delicious, and it used up stuff I had in the house. Regardless, the original recipe is very easy and very good. It's a keeper.","Took a lot longer time to make. Tasty, too much rice. Husband said,it was just ok.",We don't care for peppers so we left them out and it still worked great! It has a wonderful zesty Mexican flavor! We've even tried doubling the salsa and making soft tacos with the recipe. Same great flavor!,"Excellent for a family dinner. I couldn't get Poblano peppers so I used orange and yellow - still good. I am sure the Poblano would give it an amazing flavor! Also, i had to use ground beef instead of pork but I loved it. I hope to find both original ingredients next time I make it!",Whole family loved it! That never happens! I had some leftover chicken that was marinated in a carne asada (so I guess it’s pollo asada...? Lol). Turned out great and got to use up some leftovers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"I made this for Christmas and my family loved it. I used the baking instructions from the ""Perfect Prime Rib"" article found on this website. I chose to sear the meat then do cook the meat at the low temperature for a long time. It turned out great. Here is the information: Time and Temperature There are two ways you can roast it: At a low temperature for a long time, or At a high temperature for a shorter time. Your roast will shrink less if you cook it low and slow, but you won't get the same flavorful, well-browned exterior that a high roasting temperature gives you. It's possible to combine the two methods by starting the roast at a high temperature to sear the outside of it, then turning down the oven after 30 to 45 minutes to finish the roasting. If roasting at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), the meat will take about 17 to 20 minutes per pound. If you start the roast at 450 degrees F (235 degrees C) for the first 30 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), allow about 13 to 15 minutes per pound. The meat was tender and delicious. Thanks!","Wonderful! Even though I cooked a 4.5 lb roast, I made the amount of garlic mixture called for in the recipe, which covered the fat very generously and produced a delicious crust. One reviewer mentioned their garlic was bitter. I imagine that the high initial temperature of 500 degrees scorched the garlic. I seared my roast at 460 for 12 minutes, and then since the fat seemed like it was on the verge of smoking, I turned the oven down to 400 for the last 8 minutes. I then roasted at 350 degrees rather than the 325 in the recipe, until my meat thermometer read 130 degrees. It was juicy with beautiful pink color in the center. Thanks Chen!","who knew making prime rib could be so simple! I have to say that this is the best piece of beef I have ever prepared. The au jus was eloquent! Just the right proportion of ingredients. The combination of the thyme and garlic gives a lovely flavor to the meat. Had a 4# piece, so halved the recipe for the marinade and it was spot on. Used kosher salt and ground the paste with my mortar and pestal. Scored the fat and placed the marinade on top pressing down on the marinade to soak into the cuts. Marinated this morning and placed in fridge, took out 1 hour before making. Thanks for the recommendations of turning down oven; did at 450 for the 20minutes then proceeded. I did add some beef broth to the bits at the bottom of the pan and it made a lovely thick, rich, dark au jus. I would love to use this on other cuts of beef using the same method. thanks so much!","My first prime rib, but not my last, I can't believe how easy this was, and so good. I made this for 8 adults and it got rave reviews, my husband said it was the best he ever had. I was so nervous, I've been known to overcook many a roast, but not this one, it melted in your mouth. The only changes I made were like some of the other reviewers stated and I browned it at 460 for 12 min. and then another 8 at 400, reduced it to 325 and cooked for 20 min per pound. I took it out when the temp registered 125 (was getting nervous), and let it sit out for 20 min. It was definatly a perfect rare in the center and med-rare on the ends. Terrific! The only change for me would be maybe take it out when temp reached 130, because I like more med-rare to med. But trust me no one complained, it was high 5's all around.","Very good!! I personally think that an instant read digital thermometer is key to making a perfect prime rib. I cooked a 5 pound prime rib and used the same amount of mixture ingredients as a 10 pound roast calls for. I followed other reviews and cooked at 460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes & 325 for the remainder. I cooked it for 20-25 minutes a pound and took out of the oven when the internal temperature hit 125. I covered it in aluminum foil and let sit for about 10-20 minutes, until the internal temperature was about 135. It was a perfect medium rare.",I tried this recipe and it is awesome! I used a smaller cut of meat and adjusted the seasonings. Use an instant read thermometer and you cannot go wrong. I'm planning on using it again for our Christmas dinner. Thanks!,"Excellent flavor and easy to do. (Though I'm always a wee bit nerveous when making Prime Rib.) I followed the other Reviewers suggestions and dropped the searing temp. to 460 degrees and increased the roasting time & temp: 15 minutes & 350, respectivly. **I cut the thyme to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary. Use a meat thermometer and you really can't go wrong. Came out fabulous! I'd do this again in a minute!","Oh, my! This is absolutely fabulous, I can't believe that I made it. I used a 5.44 lb roast and followed the suggestions listed below. Thanks, Chen!!","This was the absolute best Father's Day meal I have ever fixed my husband of 15 years. After the smoke cleared out of the house (I gotta clean that oven!), it smelled like heaven in here! The crust was perfection! I was afraid the garlic and salt would make the drippings too strong to make a good gravy, but I was so, so, so wrong! After using some of the goodies from the pan to make the Yorkshire pudding, I only had about 1/3 cup left. I poured some cold canned beef broth into it, which was great because the change in temp made some of the fat coagulate so I could skim it off the top). I then thickened it with some cornstarch and served the BEST beef gravy I have ever made. Next time, I'll take the beef out at 130 so it is truly medium rare after the carryover cooking stops. I'll also get a bigger roast as my first-grader declared it his favorite meat and has been gazing longingly at the leftovers that will be tonight's dinner. Then again...maybe we'll have the beef for lunch and make Dad stop for a pizza on the way home. Hmmm! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.","Fairly standard roasting directions. Marinade nothing special. I'm curious as to what makes other reviewers believe this average ""recipe"" is 5-star caliber.","I had a 5 lb. rib roast and made half of the rub. I put the roast in at 450 for 20 minutes then reduced to 325 for the remainder. (I thought 500 degrees might burn the garlic like some other reviewers mentioned and didn't want to take the chance.) I took the meat out at 135 degrees, it rested for exactly 15 minutes, and it was a perfect light shade of pink. While the roast rested I made the following au jus: I removed the fat from the pan and added 1 cup of beef stock and a 1/2 cup of cabernet sauvignon to the drippings, and gave a light sprinkle of dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt and pepper and reduced until it thickened up a bit. Then I added 1 T of unsalted butter off the heat. The roast was tender, juicy and just perfect. Thanks, Chen!","I've done this with both a boneless and bone-in prime rib but both needed more cooking time than stated making dinner a little late but definitely worth waiting for. I made the full amount of marinade mixture for my 5.25 lb. roast. I cooked at 450 for 15 minutes to sear the outside, then lowered the temp to 325 for about 2 hrs. and 20 min. till it reached an internal temp of 140. I removed from the oven, covered it in foil and let sit for about 10 minutes. The slices on the outer edges were slightly pink and the slices towards the center were slightly more rare. Other reviewers mentioned taking the roast out at 125 or 130 which I think is too early. Cook time probably has to do with how cold the piece of meat is when it goes in the oven. I had mine on the counter for 1 hour but it was still quite chilly. I vow to get this in the oven earlier next time! I made a very simple au jus to serve with the meat by pouring off all but about 1-2 Tbsp. of fat from the roasting pan and placing over heat. I whisked in 3 cups beef broth and 1/4 cup red wine. You may need to strain through a colander to remove the blackened pieces of garlic. I also make a creamy horseradish by mixing sour cream with horseradish. We made prime rib french dip sandwiches with the leftovers. Spread the horseradish on the buns and serve with au jus. So good!","These are fairly standard seasonings for a rib roast, unfortunately though, roasting this piece of meat at such a high temperature (500 degrees) will make the garlic bitter and ruin a very expensive cut. Practice tells one to reduce the heat to 450 - 460 before putting the roast in. Pull the roast at 125 degrees and tent with foil for 10 + minutes which will allow the roast to continue to cook and the juices to absorb. It should settle at 135 degrees for a perfect medium rare!!! Good with changes....","AMAZING!!! AMAZING!! Prime rib has always been my favorite cut of meat and my grandmother would make it for me on special occasions. And although I couldn't contact my grandmother for her recipe and cooking tips, I decided to rely on this recipe and hope for the best. The results were OMG! I followed everyone's advice of 12 mins at 460 and 8 mins at 400 and then 15 mins per pound at 325 and then took it out and covered for 15 minutes. Each piece of roast was the perfect shade of pink on the inside and a bit less pink on the outsides. Even the end pieces were juicy and perfect. The roast melted in our mouths. It was a 4.5lb roast for 2 people (I wanted leftovers!) and we ate about 1lb per person cuz it was too good!! This is definitely a 5 star recipe!!! THANK YOU Chef Mike!","This was very good, but I did use different tempatures than recommended. I cross-referenced this recipe with the one in the America's Test Kitchen (ATK) cookbook. I mixed everything for the garlic topping as shown here, and it was delicious. Change nothing about it. I also then salted and peppered the rest of the prime rib. For the the temps, I did sear it in the oven at the beginning at 475 degrees, but then I turned it way down to 250 degrees. ATK recommended this to keep it juicy, and boy was it ever juicy. It will take longer to cook this way, but the slow cooking resulted in the juiciest beef. It took me about 1.5 hours to cook a 3.5 lb. roast to rare. Also the final temp of the beef I think is a little high here. ATK recommended taking it out at 125 degrees for rare, and that temp was perfect. The most important step is to take it out of the oven at the end, and tent foil over the top. Let it stand for 20-30 minutes before carving to retain all of the juices. All of your hard work will be for nothing if you don't do this most important step! Finally, I served it with a basic horseradish sauce - 1 c. sour cream, 4 tsp. prepared horseradish, 1/8 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper. Perfect for our Christmas dinner!","This prime rib was wonderful. I made it for Christmas dinner and it was the most tender prime rib I've ever had. I followed the directions exactly and couldn't have been happier with the taste. My prime rib was 8.5 pounds and unfortunately did take a little over an hour longer to cook than the stated cook time of 1:30 for medium rare. I took the roast out when the meat thermometer read 145° and that was at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I am only mentioning this for the future makers of this recipe so they can have a meat thermometer handy so they can judge when they should start to prepare their side dishes so everything will be done at once. All in all, an amazing recipe and the taste and tenderness more than made up for the late dinner :o) I highly recommend this recipe! Thank you for posting it!","This is the best roast recipe ever, look no further!!! I use a 2.5 - 3 lb. prime rib roast and half the ingredients. It has been suggested to use half thyme and half rosemary, but I always use both in equal amounts. I usually let the roast sit out for the full hour with the mixture on, I find the flavour to be more full that way. I also find the cooking time to be off (good idea to use a meat thermometer), for a 2.5 lb med-rare roast I bake at 500 for 20 mins, turn oven down to 325 and roast for an additional 50 mins, then tent the roast for 15. Enjoy!",there was a lot of smoke coming out of my oven at 500F which scared my dog like i never seen before but i stuck to it and it came out beautifully. i've used this marinade on rib-eye steaks too. works great!,"After searching the web, I stumbled across this recipe and saw soooo many good reviews of this recipe so I decided to make it. Boy am I glad I did. The taste was great, but I overcooked my prime rib roast. Lesson learned. The details are below. The only modifications I made were: -I put 6 slits on top of roast and stuffed 3 cloves of garlic (cut in half) in it. -I used kosher salt. -I used 10 cloves of garlic instead of recommended number. -I used the seasoning all over the roast. Meat: -4.5 pound prime rib roast from Costco Thermometer: -Pyrex Pro Digital Thermometer from Bed Bath and Beyond ($20) Prepared seasonings the night before and rubbed it all over roast and put in fridge overnight for a total of 16 hrs before taking out for room temperature. Left out side to come to room temperature for 2 hours. (I live in the Bay Area and my house is colder than most houses) Put in 500 degree oven for 20 minutes. (The first 10 minutes made my kitchen smell sooo good of garlic. There was no burning smell or smoke.) I then put in the thermometer (because of warning from thermometer) and put in 3 large brown potatos and 1 large sweet potato on the sides of the drip pan (not inside the drip pan). Lowered temperature to 325 degrees and cooked until internal temp hit 135 degrees. I took it out of oven and tented with foil until 145 degrees. I cut open the roast and served dinner. The meat came out perfect medium (my guests and I prefer medium rare, but it was still very","When you pay that much for a good cut of meat these days ($6.99/lb) its hard to risk trying a new recipe, but after reading all of the reviews on this one, I felt I couldn't go wrong. Boy, was I right! I had a roast of just over 4.5 lbs but as others recommended, I used the same amount of ingredients and rubbed it over the entire roast. I let the roast sit at room temp for about 45 mins. and then seared it in the oven for about 18 minutes at 425 degrees. I turned the oven down to 325 and it took another 2 hours or so to reach a temp of 140 on the meat thermometer. I took it out of the oven and let it sit, and it reached 145 on its own. Part of the roast was on the medium side while the rest was a perfect medium rare. Will definitely do this again. Update: Tried this with a 4lb New York Roast, (hubby bought it on sale saying it was half the price of a rib eye and just as good... yeah right)... The flavor was just as great (due to the marinade, of course) and the meat was very tender, but the general quality of the meat just does not compare to rib eye. Sorry honey! Don't skimp on the cut. It is well worth the price.","This was my first attempt at prime rib, and it turned out wonderfully! I had a 4 pound roast, so I lowered the initial cooking temp to 450, for fifteen minutes. I lowered the temp again to 325 for about 1 hr and ten minutes and used a foil tent. I agree with other reviewers in that the key is watching the thermometer! The roast was taken out at 130 degrees, and in fifteen minutes it was juicy, pink, and delicious. Can't go wrong with this recipe! Thanks!","First prime rib was a major success. To die for! Chose the 460 for 12, 400 for 8, 325 for 20 mins per pound. Sat 35 mins. Perfect med rare. Garlic did burn in spots but the crust was soooo delicious just the same.","Delicious! I used a 5lb prime rib. Cooked in a 460 degree oven for 12 minutes, turned down to 400 for 8 minutes after that I then turned the oven down once more to 350 and cooked it 20 minutes per pound and then an additional 15 minutes because we like OUR prime rib cooked to medium... light pink in color! It was perfect and I made an AU JUS for dipping...I added 1 cup of beef broth to the pan and and put it over heat till all the brown bitscame loose from the pan. I then strained it. PEFECT! =)","I used the recipe substituting tenderloin for prime rib due to my personal preferance, It was absolutley perfect. What a great recipe","I consider myself an expert when it comes to EATING prime rib. It's one of my favorites. So I figured it was high time for me to learn how to make this for myself. I went to the grocery store and ask the butcher for a really good cut of prime rib roast. He suggested a five pounder that was $12.00 a pound!! Now I know why it's so expensive at the resturants! So I take my little treasure home and mix up the stuff to season it with exactly per the recipe. Then I covered the entire roast with the mixture instead of just the fat part. After reading about smoking up the house at 500 degrees, I put the roast on the BBQ. I checked the temperature after two hours and it was 150 degrees. I had dinner ready for my wife when she got home complete with mixed veggies, squished taters, champagne and flowers on the table! We both thought it was one of the best tasting and juiciest prime ribs ever. The next day I made sandwiches on french bread and that too was excellent. Our BBQ has three burners and I set the front and back one to medium heat and the center one off and put the roast in the center of the BBQ and didn't open the door for two hours and it was medium with a little pink in the center. I think one and one half hours would be right for it to be rare. Absolutely, positively delecious!!!!","Everyone kept saying it was the best prime rib they ever had! And I agree! I made two 5 pound roasts and timed the cooking as a 5 lb cut. I used fresh thyme. As others suggested, I did 12 min at 460, 8 at 400, and 1 hr and 40 min at 325. Came out perfect at 125 degrees. I can't get over how good this was!",,,,,,,,,,

9,"I made Chef John's meatloaf a week or so ago and it was quite tasty which made me excited to try his meatball recipe. The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I'd double the italian seasoning but that's really just personal to our family.","These meatballs were awesome! I added more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, left out the red pepper, and used beef broth instead of milk. They were a big hit and I even posted a picture! Thanks Chef John!","CJ's Italian Meatballs Haiku: ""I can't believe it. These beat 'Meatball Nirvana' And they held up too!"" So my biggest praise for these meatballs is that after I made a double-batch, w/o changing the recipe, I froze them into weekly portions, but after thawing a handful of them in sauce last night, I couldn't have been more delighted that they held their meatball shape and didn't fall apart! So I don't know what of CJ's method, or ingredients, resulted in a firm (oh yes, and scrumptious!) meatball, but I think this recipe has replaced AR's 'Meatball Nirvana' in our house from now on.","Excellent meatballs! They are perfectly seasoned! I prefer to mix the bread crumbs with milk in a large bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes then mix in the eggs, parsley, parmesan cheese, the sautéed onions with garlic and all of the dry seasonings into this bowl. In a separate large bowl, I mix the beef and pork together then mix the contents of the previous bowl into the bowl of meat and place it into the fridge for an hour or so before forming the meatballs. I think that by doing so – everything mixes together more evenly. I find it impossible to mix the beef and pork together without using your hands, same goes for mixing the meat with the remaining ingredients. I didn’t notice any toughness in the meatballs by doing it my way. I’ve heard numerous times to not work ground beef too much otherwise the meat will turn tough. I don’t believe that myth. I use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and pack them into balls with wet hands. I added half of the cooked meatballs to a simmering pot of marina sauce and finished simmering them in the sauce for an hour. The remaining meatballs were put in a freezer bag and frozen for later use.","These are FANTASTIC meatballs! I used meatloaf mix, b/c it was cheaper (believe it or not) than buying the beef and pork seperately. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain and dried parsley in place of the fresh. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise and would not change a thing next time. I was scared b/c the mixture was so soft (even after refrigeration), but I proceeded on, and I am so glad I didn't add extra breadcrumbs like I wanted to...these held their shape and were so moist, tender, flavorful and delicious...one of the best I've made/eaten! I used my large cookie scoop and got 26 out of this recipe. My family RAVED over these...even my 10 month old twins couldn't get enough, lol. Seriously, these are sooooo good! I will def be using this recipe over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)","These meatballs were excellent! I followed the recipe as is. No problems with it whatsoever. Thanks Chef John! Fellow members, please refrain from changing the recipe to suit yourself and rate it as if its the exact recipe that is posted. If you make changes, any changes to the recipe, you're rating your own recipe..Doesn't make sense.",I just took these out of the oven and they were swimming in liquid!! They weren't browned or even close - the flavor of the meat is good but the consistency of the cooked meatballs is wrong - won't make again!,"These tasted really good and were super easy to make. Just a couple of things: I think next time I'll use maybe a 1/3 cup of milk as they were almost too juicy to form into balls. Also, next time I will try baking them with a rack in the pan as they really did make a lot of grease and I think they would taste better without sitting in it. Third, I wish they would have browned up a little better. I even kept them in the oven for a few more mintutes at 450 and that didn't help. But, again, the best tasting meatballs I've ever made. Nothing wrong with the recipe as written, just personal preference, a five star recipe for sure!","Wow. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe to a T and I wasn't disappointed. These meatballs were intended for sub sandwiches with marinara, but after tasting them fresh out of the oven, I felt like I was doing an injustice to this fine specimen of meat by slopping marinara over it. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be using this for years.",Amazing!! Made these to add to my spaghetti sauce and they were delicious exactly as written! We froze half of them and I can't wait to use them for meatball subs!,"I made these mostly as written though I halved the recipe for my small family. They were the tastiest meatball I've ever tried! I chose to use all ground beef instead of with pork, and used 93% lean for a healthier choice. I loved that this didn't require the pan browning first. We ate these plain without a sauce with herb roasted potatoes and a salad, and it was such a tasty meal. The meatballs were very moist with a perfect texture. I'll make these from now on, and will also add these to my spaghetti sauce!","Ok I have already reviewed the Recipe, but I had to add this one too. I came home from work and we were having Spaghetti with Meat Sauce. After a couple of bites, I said this was a terrific sauce and asked where my bride had gotten the recipe. She smiled a little then told me how she was a little distracted when making the meatballs and how she just added the meat to the sauce pan with the onions, and when she realized what she had done it was too late. Very Funny, so I think we stumbled on another Recipe ""Chef John's Meat Sauce"".",This was my first time ever making meatballs. I thought they were a bit of a pain and did not add anything to a recipe. But my husband specifically asked for meatballs with his spaghetti so I decided to try this one since it did not call for them to be cooked twice like every other meatball recipe I have ever read. I could not be happier than if I had not had to make them at all! This recipe was super easy and super tasty! These were as easy as making meat loaf and tasted better! I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us and put the full recipe amount of the herbs as my husband likes things spicy. Even the red pepper flakes. They were not too hot even for me and I cannot tolerate a lot of hot. I would cut them in half for children though. I was worried about the salt because I don't care for a lot of salt but I left it alone this first time except for cutting it in half thinking if it was too salty I would cut it next time. It was just right. We both loved this recipe. If you try only one meatball recipe make it this one you will not be sorry! Thank you Chef John for sharing this super good and super easy meatball recipe!,"These meatballs were awesome! Like most other people, I did change a few things, but only because I didn't have the exact ingredients listed. I had 93/7% ground beef so I used 1 1/2 lbs of that and I was going to use 1/2 lb Jenni-O Sweet Italian Sausage with casings removed. But by accident I had bought Turkey Bratwurst. So I used 2 of them and mashed them thoroughly into the ground beef. I also used about 1tablespoon of dried parsley instead of fresh, only 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. And when the onion was about finished cooking, I added the chopped garlic to bring out the flavor. For me, it made 28 meatballs and each was 2 Weight Watcher points plus. Since it's just my husband and myself, we have 2 more meals now in the freezer already in the sauce that I made and 16 more meatballs (without sauce) bagged in the freezer as well. Now we can have these delicious meatballs any time we want.",Best meatballs ever! These were delicious and hit the spot for the hubs who was craving spaghetti & meatballs. Instead of using plain ground pork I used groung italian sausage (mild). After baking them I let them simmer in marinara with sliced italian sausage to meld the flavors. We had leftover meatballs so made meatball subs for lunch the next day. Even better the second day. Will definitely make this recipe again!,"Huge hit w/the boys here! Easy & quick to make. I didn't precook the onions, just chopped them fine in my mini chopper & threw them in. Decreased the salt & pepper by 1/2 as a personal preference.","This recipe is perfect!! The meatballs held together very well, perfectly spiced!! I scooped with a cookie scoop to make sure all meatballs were even sized.","Fantastic recipe - made GREAT meatballs sandwiches! I love the red pepper flakes, they gives the meatballs a little added punch!","My husband hates italian food, but he will eat it occasionally for me and the kids. He LOVED these meatballs!! He actually went back for 2nds and 3rds!! Thank you Chef John!!!","Delicious meatballs. I have always baked my meatballs. It gives them a great flavor and makes it easier to cook and to cleanup. The only change I made was to use only ground beef instead of beef and pork mixture, its just a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe Chef John.","O so delish. Loved them. I did add more Italian seasoning, about TBL. Also added more garlic, about 4 gloves. Served them on steak Italian rolls. Put provolone cheese on rolls then put under broiler until melted. Um Um good. Thanks Chef John for the recipe.","I've made big batch meatballs this way for the freezer for years, and I use all the ingredients here except for the olive oil and salt. I never make less than 5 lb meat at a time, and this makes about 6 quart size freezer bags of 30 meatballs each. I don't really measure seasonings anymore, I just eyeball them. I do have a rule of 1 egg to 1 lb meat, and no more than 1 C of filler to 5 lb meat. The rest I wing to taste, as many of the 600+ reviewers also do. I mix the fillers, seasonings, liquids, and eggs in a big mixing bowl, then add the meat and mix thoroughly. I don't precook anything, and it all comes out of the oven very tender. I use cookie scoops, small for spaghetti and large for subs, to scoop out a half sheet pan of balls, then go back and roll them. I bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, pull out the tray, drain grease, then use a spatula to loosen the balls and shake them around at bit. Back in the oven until well browned (sometimes need to broil a bit), and drain again before cooling and packing in freezer bags. My husband likes meatballs, and this is the most painless way for me to satisfy his craving. I think this recipe is more about process and less about amounts as everyone's taste is a bit different.","I tried these meatballs for the first time today. I made them exactly according to the recipe like I always do when I try something for the first time. Whenever I am looking for a particular recipe I always try Chef John's first so this was a little disappointing. I'd like to make a few comments that others can use or take with a grain of salt (excuse the pun): 1.The red pepper didn't make the meatballs spicy or hot so I wouldn't hesitate to use it again. 2.The meatballs were not ""Italian"" enough for me so I, like others, would increase the Italian spices or use fresh & 4 cloves of garlic would have been better than three. 3.The onions only took about 10 minutes to become transparent. You don't want them to brown and taste like ""fried"" onions so watch carefully. 4. The recipe had too much onion and made them taste like meatloaf. I would cut back or eliminate next time. 5. I felt 40 smaller meatballs would be better in the sauce. I made thirty but they seemed big. 6. Mine browned only slightly but I didn't keep them in longer as I didn't want them to dry out. May try 450 degrees & decrease the time if I decrease size. 7. I used at least 1/2 cup of parsley, pressed down, and it was fine. Question: Any tips on how to keep them from going flat on the bottom? All in all a pretty good recipe I will try again. Video shows good instructions for forming and mixing. Thanks Chef John.","This is honestly the best meatball recipe around! If you use the suggested ingredients and assemble the meatballs as Chef John suggests you will have tasty, juicy, flavorful meatballs every time! They also freeze well and are just as good reheated.","I made this recipe for appetizers, so I made the balls about 1"". I baked the meatballs on a cookie cooling rack on the baking sheet so the grease drains off, plus the heat circulates around the meatballs (350 for 12 minutes). They are perfect! Very tasty! I plan to reheat the meatballs in marinara sauce on New Years.","He knew the battle had been won, but at what cost? The destruction made the thought of a Pyrrhic victory pleasurable. An impossible luxury. The dust settled, the expectant groans and echoing screams of such a fight rang in his head but the grounds offered only silence. There were no survivors. Evil incarnate. The scorched Earth salted by the blood of the aggressors sucked the spectrum of light into its depths, reflecting back the closest resemblance of Hell even Mother Earth could not comprehend of the once bountiful pasture. Lucifer himself winced at the sight, and far be it from any being to assume him a coward. You would do the same. Who is to blame, he thought. Blame? An irrelevant childish concept. Had simply one more meatball been crafted, baked, seared to absolute undeniable juicy perfection, perhaps I wouldn't be telling this story. The story of the time I served John's meatballs at my neighborhood potluck. Chef John's Italian meatballs.","Quite good. This recipe makes a lot. If you're not feeding a crowd, I recommend using the leftover meat in ""Chef John's Stuffed Peppers"", which are super good",This recipe is super and easy. It is the homemade taste I have been looking for. I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. I used 2 lbs. beef and 1 lb. Italian sausage. instead of fresh parsley and garlic I substituted with 3 teaspoons garlic salt with parsley in it and held the salt as well. The rest of the ingredients were increased by 50% to accommodate the extra beef. I got 60 meatballs out of my batch!,Followed this to the letter; makes fabulous meatballs! Family loved them! Thanks!,,,,,,,
10,"Great flavor and wonderful seasonings but I made a lot of revisions. First I used 2 pounds stew meat rather than 1/2, and I didn't boil the beef, I dredged it in seasoned and browned it, then set it aside. I omitted parsnips (what are parsnips anyway?) and zucchini. Rather than go through the whole roasting pan ordeal, I dumped the browned beef & 1 can of beef broth into the pot with veggies, added a cup of water put the lid on & simmered for about 1 1/2 hours. The only change I will make next time would be to add the apples about half way through, because they were a bit soggy after cooking. Other than that, it's DELICIOUS! Wasn't too spicy for my kids either.","Delicious! I added some vegetable stock and rosemary to the chicken (I had no beef) while cooking and substituted 1 extra carrot and 1 extra potato because I had no parsnips. I left out the raisins and used peanuts too. It turned out great, but I'm sure it would have even without the adjustments.",A good spicy meal. My hubby made it while I was out and I came home to the house smelling yummy! The spice was a little much for me but perfect for my hubby.,"This was heavenly! And wow, did it smell good cooking. I think you could use just about any combination of vegetables and it would work. We served it with saffron rice and naan, and it was delicious. Thank you so much for posting this!","This was a delicious curry and excellent way to use up left over root vegetables. I added a can of coconut milk to the recipe. It had a bit more spice than I like, but my husband found it just right. It was perfect for a cold winter night meal.","This is a great recipe!! We only used half of the recipe, the other half went in the freezer. So to half of this recipe, I added 1 can coconut milk, (just because we love it, and it makes a nice sauce) tablespoon of mango chutney, more curry powder, and used left over roast beef, which I added near the end of the baking time, with the apples. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!","Fantastic! A flavorful escape from our norm and even the kids enjoyed it. I forgot to buy the beef so we did just the vegetables and used beef broth as the liquid (also threw in a rutabaga). The house smelled so good while it was cooking. We used extra garlic but still found that the ginger was the strongest flavor. Looking for the 5 spice, I found Dukkah blend at Trader Joe's: almonds, sesame seeds, fennel seeds, coriander, anise seeds, and kosher salt. Used about a tablespoon of that with the curry and turmeric but forgot to add cinnamon and cloves. Overall, it was better than I thought it would be.","The spices are nice, but made it a stoup instead of baking, made few adjustments since I don't like the bland result. So I added 2 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoons Thai yellow curry paste, 150ml coconut milk (not too thick). I add in apple at the end. If you mix a bit of couscous or oatmeal, garnish with coriander leaves, it becomes a full meal and tastes wonderful, very light beef curry stoup, the coconut milk does wonders.",Just ok. Served this over rice,"Delicious! Floured and browned the beef first, then put in crockpot for 4 hrs., added 3/4 can of coconut milk as someone suggested, also doubled curry, last 1/2 hr. added cashews and raisins.","In progress, ingredients are very appealing. Although much a pealing to do... looks great so far. I couldn't find locally sourced parsnips, so substituted a turnip. We'll see if turning up the volume does anything bad. check my other substitutions in the pic",This is a very tasty and comforting food. I made it how the receipt calls for. Next time I will not boil the meat but sear it in the pan that the veggies get cooked in. Then cook it for less time in the oven. Also I might try to add coconut milk in it to sweeten it and add another depth of flavor.,"This was okay. The recipe was followed, with the omittance of cashews, as none were on hand. The beef needed another 30 minutes of slow cooking. We both felt it needed a bit more flavor, be it curry, garlic or seasonings.",Interesting. I made it with boca burger instead of beef and eggplant as I did not have zucchini. And more of potatoes instead of pasnips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Very tasty! I only used 2 Tbsp. of oil, and I think next time I will half the salt. I cooked it on medium for 6 minutes per side to avoid having the sauce stick to the pan. Very easy to make and great flavor!","What an amazing recipe! I made it exactly as written, except that I grilled it outdoors instead of cooking in a pan. The flavor was outstanding. The cardamom really takes this to another level, so don't leave it out! It's a pricey spice, but well worth it! I will be making this frequently, especially for guests because it will definitely impress. Next time I will try it with the orange zest, as suggested. Thank you for the great recipe!",I loved the flavor combination. Will keep in the rotation for weeknight meals. I like to buy a large tray of salmon at Costco and then freeze it in smaller portions - this is a great way to use the frozen/thawed leftovers.,"delightful! we eat a lot of Indian cuisine, so I had all the spices on hand. I added a little cayenne since we like heat. baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. To my taste the flavors were very subtle and didn't overpower the flavor of the fish, but rather complemented it nicely.","Wow! Fabulous flavor and so easy to prepare! I usually poach our salmon, so just made a half recipe of the sauce and poured it on top of 3 salmon filets from Costco. I only used an 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper, as some of the family have sensitive stomachs. I added perhaps one or two tablespoons of water, so there would be enough moisture to create steam to poach the fish when the lid was placed on the pan. I'll be making this again and again! UPDATE: I made this for a second time, poaching as before. This time, I sprinkled the dry spices over the salmon, and drizzled a bit of maple on each filet. I skipped the oil entirely and everyone liked it even better than last time. It's my new ""impress the company"" recipe!","My husband fishes in Alaska every year, I always have a freezer full of fresh Salmon and I am always looking for new recipes this one is a keeper, it is simple and simply delicious. Don't hesitate give it a try.","Ahhhhhmazing. But the Cordamom can be overpowering so my recommendation is to use a little less than the recipe calls for. Even so, I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. I cooked it for a friend and she couldn't get enough of it! She said to me: ""This is restaurant quality food."" Will definitely make again and again.","I’m always looking for new ways to fix salmon. This was a nice change from what seems like the same old boring seasonings. The spice combination complimented the salmon very well. My only problem was keeping the salmon from burning. Thank goodness hubby is a sport when it comes to eating charred food. I reduced the heat to a lower setting, but the longer cook time still resulted in a slightly burnt coating. I think this would be fantastic cooked on a grill.",Tasted great. Easy to make. Family loved it.,I used the sauce on a whole salmon I made on the BBQ. It was really good. Everyone in the family loved it though a couple people commented it was a touch too salty. I'll cut the salt back to 1 tsp next time.,"I really liked this a lot. My husband and kids were not as thrilled as me, but they don't enjoy salmon as much as I do, either. The flavor was great and it was easy to cook. I served this with soba noodles but I think rice would work better. I might reduce the oil a bit next time as well.","I made this yesterday with some spinach. It was excellent. Next time I make this salmon, I will not put so much salt. I think 1 teaspoon would have been enough.",Yummy!,"I made this specifically because of the cardamom. I was looking for more recipes containing cardamom. This sounded wonderful with the maple syrup. I rubbed the salmon with the oil and then rubbed the spices in. Then added the maple syrup. I did this about an hour before cooking Delicious and will certainly make it again, especially for guests. Quick and easy.",It was ok but nothing special to my taste,"This is a unique blend of smoky and sweet. Super easy! Will definitely make this again. Hint - do use the orange zest, really kicks the taste up.",I cut back on cardamom and it was still too much.,"Made this nearly as written, only I used regular canola oil as I didn't have the grapeseed and used half as much salt. Plus I added a bit of orange zest, which was a good choice. Turned out the orange zest was all I could taste! It was all pleasant enough, though mostly boring, but I really wanted to taste the cardamom. Maybe with some tweaking this could be better but I'm not sure if anything will make me remember it long enough to try it next time.","Amazing! I left it a little longer in pan it burned just a tad, and it was amazing. Thanks",Tasty! I followed the recipe and enjoyed it.,"Very east to make and quite yummy! The taste is not too sweet, just right.",Really wasn't a fan of the cardamom :/,Holy moly! Super delish!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,My husband and I loved this entree and would highly recommend it! I substituted Bone-In Pork Shoulder Spare Rib meat and Yukon Gold Potatoes (what I had on hand) and found it to be delicious! The funny thing is...I'm not even a big pork fan by nature. L&M from MN,Very satisfying and easy to make.,"OMG, this was soooo good. Leftovers were good too. I made some changes only because I bought a 3.8 pound top pork loin on sale for $8 instead of the 1.9 pound pork tenderloin for $16. So I had to go to my good old Betty Crocker cookbook and to the internet to get cooking times. Did all of the ingredients the same, except left off garlic and doubled all the ingredients and increased apple cider to 2 cups. I did the rub ahead of time because I was home anyway and let it sit under a blanket of plastic rap for 4 hours before cooking. Betty Crocker said to cook Top Pork Loin at 325 for 30-40 mins per pound to get internal temp of 170. I cooked it for a total of about 2 hours at 350 with just the cider mix (no sweets or apples). Also had to look up Sweet Potatos = 350 degrees for about an hour. So added them after Pork loin cooked for one hour. And I looked up Apples = 350 for about 15 minutes (I did smaller slices - like 8/apple). Even though I did over cook it a smidge, when I made the first cut, liquid squirted out and I knew it would be juicy and tender, which it was. For leftovers, we put potoatoes/apples/juice in sauce pan on low. And my husband dabbed some of the juice on the pork slices and put brown sugar/ginger mix on each side. He cooked them separately in the oven on stoneware plate at 350 for about 7 minutes then broiled at 500 until a little bubbly - a couple minutes.","I liked the seasonings very much, but, while the sweet potatoes cooked to perfection, the apples were mushy. I would recommend making sure you use a firm apple like Granny Smith or Pippin.",Strong cumin taste. I will probably omit the garam masala next time. Apples & sweet potatoes were perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14,"super good but the broth, peas, and wine were missing from my ingredients. lucky I had these. just wanted to bring attention to this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Added evaporated milk to make it creamer.,"Wow, super comfort food quality! I would like to say that I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have any liquid smoke so I had to leave that out. It was very thick so I added a teaspoon of Better than Bouillon beef concentrate with a cup of water and this was made it the perfect consistency to spoon over the egg noodles.",Very easy and delicious recipe. The sauce is very thick. If you like a thinner stroganoff I think this would be good by including a little beef broth when adding the ingredients at the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"I added sliced portobello mushrooms because I love them and used Victoria White Linen Marinara. I couldn’t find the chili paste so I used red pepper flakes and chili powder. This recipe is really easy, has a lot of flavor and makes a lot of leftovers.","Really good! I made it exactly as instructed (er.... except I did 5 cloves of garlic... hehehe) since I’ve never made anything like this before and I’m a novice cook. I’m not on keto but just a wanted something tasty and healthy. I usually don’t like cauliflower but the cauliflower rice was well incorporated and didn’t bother me at all. The only thing is that I would like to find a way to make the sauce of the mixture a little bit thicker next time (maybe slightly less water or a little bit of some kind of thickener? Or let it simmer a bit longer?). Sorry my picture isn’t great, the red plates we have don’t make food the most photogenic. Anyway it was delicious and I’d definitely make it again even if I can’t thicken it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Very good, simple straightforward and delicious.","wow. we've made this as ordered, but we also used the buttermilk marinade for chicken wings and are REALLY pleased with the results. We haven't been back to that... place since we started making this recipe. If you do it right, it comes out great.","I'll admit that I did make a couple changes: I used pickle juice instead of buttermilk (didn't have it) to marinate the chicken, I didn't add any hot sauce, and I forgot to add the ranch mix to the marinade so I split it between the wet and dry coating. I was most impressed by the crunchiness of the batter! I have a go-to Chic-Fil-A copycat recipe that possibly has a slightly better flavor, due to the addition of a TB of powdered sugar in the dry batter, but it does not achieve the crust that you'll get with this recipe. I really liked the flavor! I definitely recommend marinating your chicken overnight or as long as you can before cooking.","Made this the way Chef suggested (mostly), and split the recipe two ways to make a mild version for me, and a spicy version for my husband. The breading was great, but I think next time I will use slightly less cornstarch, because I think that might be why the breading comes off the chicken when you bite into it. I didn't really care though, the overall seasoning is awesome.","This had a breading that was similar to a cross between a Mc chicken sandwich and a Chick-fil-A sandwich. I highly recommend you only use one chicken breast to make two sandwiches. If you prefer the bun a Chick-fil-A sandwich comes on, you really need to use brioche buns and be sure to toast it before assembling your sandwich. Do not be afraid to add the cayenne pepper to your breading. it doesn’t really add any heat, just flavor. I also added hot sauce to mayo. At 40 years old, this is the first fried chicken I have ever successfully made. It is super easy if you follow the recipe. Good luck and Enjoy!!","So first off I used a breast that was WAY to thick which made for some very raw chicken in the center, this meant I had to throw it into the oil for a second round. Beyond my own personal failings I actually found the breading itself to be rather basic, not terrible, not great. I generally don’t enjoy frying things since hot oil scares me so needless to say, given all that this won’t be one of the Chef’s recipes I go back to. (Luckily there are plenty of others I love to cook over and over!)",I followed this recipe and it does not have the taste of either Popeye's or Chick fil a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

20,"We love this recipe and I keep finding new ways to modify it (I feel I have to, since I make it at LEAST once a week)This is how we like it: I use celery seed rather than celery salt and usually have parmesan-romano cheese blend on hand so I use that. I also add 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes. I don't add any lemon juice anymore (I used to just reduce it by half) but now use low-fat mayo that I find to be quite tangy. I also double the amount of pepper and add about 1/2 c. of bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, which creates a nice texture and keeps the topping in place. Seasoning the fish with a bit of Old Bay seasoning, as others have done, really adds to the flavor as well. Thank you for helping us eat fish on a regular basis, Phoebe!","I made some changes to this recipe to lower some of the fat content but I still think it was delicious and deserved five stars. Instead of using regular mayo and butter, I substituted fat free mayo and light butter. I also sprayed the fillets with olive oil cooking spray before placing them under the broiler. Since tilapia cooks quickly, I didn't turn them at all. I let them cook 3 or 4 minutes (oven rack on second slot from the top), added the cheese mixture, and removed them when the cheese started to brown.","I've made this several times and this is absolutely the easiest and best tilapia, or any fish, dish I have ever made. Everyone I make it for wants the recipe. I do line a broiler pan with foil and spray the foil with cooking spray. The only other thing I do differently is to sprinkle the fish with Old Bay Seasoning before putting under the broiler for the first time and then again before topping with the parmesan mix while it is out of the oven. I also make sure that I start with the side of the fish that has the dark vein running through the center facing up starting out then it should end up on the bottom when finished. Low fat mayo makes it even more healthy than it already is without making a big difference. I've found it best to follow the cooking time closely. It's quick. It's tasty. Try it!","Excellent! Hubby declared, ""best fish ever, let's have it next week""... Only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 tsp garlic powder (because we love garlic) and 1/4 tsp paprika. The paprika really gave it a nice flavor and added a wonderful color to the cheese sauce. We will definitely be making this often.","I scaled this recipe in half and went with some of the suggestions of reviewer, Shannon:) (click on ""most helpful"" and you'll see her review). I've only had tilapia once and wasn't that impressed with that fresh-water, farmed fish, so I went with rockfish (aka: red snapper in warmer waters; rockfish in colder northern waters). I added to the parmesan mixture: some garlic powder, paprika, a touch of cayenne pepper & some panko bread crumbs. This cheese mixture is really what makes the dish; it was excellent and I liked the way the bread crumbs/cheese browned lightly under the broiler. I only had to broil the fish 2 minutes on each side, plus 2 minutes with the cheese mixture. Served with steamed broccoli. Talk about an easy, quick-prep meal! Thanks, Phoebe!","I was really desperate for something to do with some recently defrosted tilapia fillets and spotted this recipe and it looked interesting. My husband loved it. Loved the texture, the zing of the parmesan and spice was just perfect. Will definitely make again for family & friends. Only issue was I made the spread and put it in the fridge for 1/2 hr. early and it melted way too fast in the broiler. Lost 1/2 the topping. My error. Don't recommend chilling spread 1st.","Have made this on several occasions trying to find the right balance of cheese mixture to fish. The first time I made the recipe exactly as stated (as a courteous nod to the submitter) and it swam in butter so I rated this at three stars (wonderful but loaded with calories). The second time, I reduced the butter again to an 1/8 cup and it was still overpowered by the butter, so try, try again to one tablespoon of butter for the perfect mixture. Wonderful flavor!!!","We're fish lovers, so maybe that's what influenced our opinion of this dish. The sauce is pungent and overpowers the delicate tilapia. It would work better on a fish with more substance and flavor to it. Tilapia is best served by lightly dressing it with olive oil, real butter and lemon juice, lightly salted and broiled. We won't want this again.",My husband and I loved this dish. It was so fast and easy. I didn't have any celery salt so I added garlic powder. I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!,I've made this twice and it is awesome and sooo easy. I would make it any day for my picky seafood eating freinds. The second time I used sour cream because we were out of mayo and it was as good if not better.,"Very easy and flavorful. Makes plenty of topping, I actually used about 1-1/2 times the amount of tilapia called for with no problems.",This recipe is great--I've already made it twice! I put each piece of fish in a foil packet (make sure you spray your foil first so the fish doesn't stick!) and then spread the topping on. Fold up the packet and grill for about 20 minutes...turns out perfectly and doesn't make the kitchen smell like fish!,"What a quick and tasty recipe! Tried this tonight, and dealing with my 3 year old ""trying to help"" me in the kitchen took me longer than the actual prep and cook...I read a lot of the reviews, and changed this about the recipe. Added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, a 1/4 of paprika and 1/2 cup of panko crumbs. I didn't have non stick spray or olive oil, so I just spritzed the foil covered cookie sheet with some butter spray, and lightly seasoned the fillets with some old bay seasoning. I broiled vein side down for 4 minutes, topped with cheese/crumb mix, and broiled for another 3...came out great and the family inhaled it! Now warning, if you don't like parmesan cheese, then don't use this recipe, it's a predominant flavor..And tilapia is a mild, somewhat delicate fish, that benefited from the stronger taste of the topping. And although I did change the origianl recipe to suit my tastes, I still give it a deserved 5 stars, for without the basis of the original recipe, I wouldn't have anything to build off of...",This recipe is similar to a halibut recipe that I make. I omitted celery salt since I didnt have any but other than that I followed recipe. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes. Perfect.,"This is a delicious tilapia recipe. I seasoned the filets on both sides with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, and seasoned salt before putting the topping on them. No need for all the mayo and butter--adjust however you want. I also added some bread crumbs to get a crispier topping.","I have similar version of this recipe that will knock your socks off! You line the bottom of a baking dish with sliced tomatoes, sprinkle about 1/2 cup of chopped Kalamata olives, add some lemon zest and squeeze lemon juice over the top and add salt and pepper. Then lay the tilapia pieces over the top and spread the mayo-parmesean mix over the fish and bake at 450 for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. It is AWESOME!",This is great. I added a 1/2 tsp. of Horseradish to kick it up.,My husband really liked it; a nice way to dress up fish.,"This is definitely a winning recipe to try!!! A recent tilapia purchase brought me to allrecipes.com for a good recipe. A 5-star rating and the fact that I happened to have all ingredients required prompted me to try this recipe. Only thing I omitted was the celery salt (not a fan). ADDED BONUS: TAKES VERY LITTLE TIME TO PREPARE!! This recipe came out so good, I went back to the store and loaded up on tilapia for the freezer- and I'm cooking it again tonite! Try!!!","This is an excellent recipe. I had no celery salt, so subbed a bit of garlic salt, and used Smart Balance instead of butter. It turned out fine. Next time I will try low-fat mayo. I only had a pound of fish because there are just two of us, but made the full amount of topping -- which was great on cooked cauliflower.","I've made this recipe at least a dozen times since I first found it. It's excellent and family and friends are crazy about it! One snowy day last year, I wanted to make it but had no tilapia. I used chicken cutlets instead and it was just as good.","As if this recipe needed any more reviews. It was great. I subbed dill for basil and used garlic salt instead of celery salt and added a little old bay. My husband and I both enjoyed it. 2 year old not so much, but that is expected. update 12/14/06:I changed up a bit the second time and added a few bread crumbs on top. Much better this way and 2 yr old loved it.","This is a wonderful base recipe! As I am a cook who does not always use exact measurements I made the following adjustments: Banged up some garlic crotons, Parmesan/Romano shredded cheese blend, Tony Chachere's Seasoning, Old Bay, Miracle Whip, and a little extra butter than called for (made extra topping). Topped the fish with that magical combo (most important do not over broil) and it was delectable. In the words of the infamous Rachael Ray...YUM-O!!! Served with egg noodles tossed with the extra topping and steamed broccoli. People could not get enough of this; so now I make it all the time!","This recipe is awesome. My son loved it and so did I. I made this with about a pound of tilapia, therefore I had extra sauce. I used the extra sauce in my rice pilaf. Dinner was a wonderful eating experience.","After over a 100 sterling reviews of this tilapia my two cents doesn't seem necessary, but for the doubters I would have to agree this is pretty darn tasty. So simple. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't alter any of the ingredients. I did add a pinch extra parmesan, but really, can you ever have too much parmesan? The flavor was excellent, prep time a breeze and all diners at my house were pleased and cleaned their plates. I will make this again and recommend others try it too! Tilapia can taste so boring, but this recipe added the punch it needs without an overpowering flavor. Yummy.",Great recipe! My wife even loved it...,I have made this three times and will make it again tonight. I used 1lb. of tilapia and added a little more lemon juice. I think I will add lump crab meat to the mixture the next time.,I got to say im really a fish lover and always looking for new recipes this one is A number (1) loved it...,,,,,,,,
21,I have made this recipe at least 15 times. What I have found that the best cut of meat to use is a tri-tip roast. There is no need to brown the meat but I do recommend triming off as much fat as possible. One problem I had was that there was always too much gravy left over. I have recently discovered that this recipe comes out just as spectacular using one can of soup and half a can of water. Do use the regular amount of onion soup mix. It should be cooked to perfection in about six hours. I also have a suggestion on the type of slowcooker used. I first tried making this recipe in a small Nesco but it was not able to keep the roast completely immersed in the soup mixture. I use a Rival. It is 7 inches wide and about 5 inches deep. This is the most typical slowcooker around. Finally a word on adding vegetables. I tried adding carrots and potatoes to this recipe and for some reason the gravy was not very flavorful. For this reason I just leave them out. Good luck!,"OK.... I tried this recipe using a 4 lb. angus bottom round roast, and after reading all the reviews that said the gravy needed to be thickened. I decided to flour the roast with flour, granulated garlic, salt and pepper. Then I browned it on all sides in a little olive oil. While it was browning on the stove, I added the rest of the ingredients to the slow cooker, I also put in two 4 oz. cans of mushrooms. However, I substituded the water for beef broth (same amount) and when the roast was done browning, I put it in the slow cooker and covered it with the mixture in the slow cooker. I also cooked it on low for 4 hours then high for the rest of the time. It came out VERY tender. No need to thicken the gravy, because the flour thickened it while it was cooking. My picky 12 yr old daughter (who eats like a bird) ate some for dinner, then again when she got home that night, and my 9 yr old son asked me to make this more often. I served it with mashed potatoes and canned corn. It was the easiest pot roast I ever made!!","BADA-BING! I have been making this recipe for quite some time now, with the exception of the cream of mushroom soup. The soup adds that OOMPH to the gravy that I have been looking for! I used beef broth instead of the water, & added 2 TBSP of corn starch to thicken it up before serving. In the last 3 hours cooking in the crock pot I added fresh carrots, green beans, potatoes & sliced onions. YUM! The family LOVES it & when my neighbors find out I'm making it, they always take dibs on the leftovers! Thanks Brenda!!","I wasn't able to follow this recipe, since I didn't have the soup and onion mix. But I wanted to add a tip that makes cooking in a crockpot SO much easier. Line the crockpot with a Reynold's oven cooking bag, Turkey size, or smaller depending on the size of your crockpot. Cooking time is the same. Then the best part, clean up. Just remove the ingredients, lift out the bag, and your done! The crockpot remains clean.","Best tasting pot roast I ever had. To make it a little healthier, I cooked it all day on low and then refrigerated it. The next evening I was able to peel off over a 1"" layer of beef fat that had hardened on the top and reheat the pot roast in the oven. I realize this defeated the 'dinner ready when you get home' purpose of a crockpot but this process removed at least 1000 calories from the dish and it still tasted fantastic!",Just an additional note to say that it's important to sear the meat on all sides before adding to the crockpot- it only takes a few minutes and really helps to seal in the juices of the meat. I made it yesterday and forgot to sear the meat first. Still tasted good but not nearly as moist as when I've seared the roast first. Enjoy!,"I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, and Lawry's Seasoning Salt. I browned the roast on all sides in a hot skillet with a little olive oil in it. I transfered the roast to the slow cooker. I added the water to the skillet and scraped up all the bits and pieces of meat that have so much flavor. I substituted a package of dry ""au jus"" mix for the onion soup mix and blended this and the mushroom soup with the water in the skillet. I put sliced onions on top of the roast, added some minced garlic, and poured the liquid over the roast. The longer you cook it, the better it gets. It is a family favorite ~","This recipe is excellent and you can't really tell canned cream of mushroom soup was used for gravy. A couple of things I substitute is an envelope of pre-packaged ""pot roast"" seasoning (McCormick's Bag 'n Season) instead of onion soup mix, and red burgundy wine instead of water. I also add diced yukon gold potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and sliced onions at the bottom of the crockpot. Cooking time for a 4-lb. roast is usually 9 hours on Low and the longer the better. I thicken the gravy slightly with cornstarch and water at the very end. Overall, very very good!","This is the best!!!! The whole house had a wonderful aroma all day. It is the best roast I have ever had and probably the easiest. I did not brown the meat ,but rubbed the roast with cajun spice. I used cream of chicken and a can of french onion , 1 pkg dry beefy onion and used a coke instead of the water. I can't wait to make it again!!!!Thanks Thanks Thanks to Brenda","This is absolutely fantastic! For this recipe, I typically use about 4 to 4 1/2 lbs of Beef Chuck Pot Roast Boneless (trim off a little of the fat) and for a family of four, this makes a two-day meal. I tweaked the recipe by using two cans of Cream of Mushroon Roasted Garlic and added beef buillion to the water. For the roast itself, I patted both sides with garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, black pepper, and flour. Then, I brown it in olive oil. All the ingredients go into the crockpot and cooks on high for 2 hours, then I add one white onion (quartered) and an 8 oz package of button mushrooms (sliced thin). It then cooks on low for 4 1/2 to 5 hours. I thicken the gravy with 2 TB of cornstarch. The first night I pair half of the roast and sauce with mashed potatoes. For the next day, I take the other half of the dish and add about 1 cup of sour cream, a pound of cooked egg noodles, and 1/4 cup of chopped green onions to make a very tasty, simple, yet different dish--beef stroganoff! Absolutely delicious meals for any two nights of the week!","This is a great, tried and true, reliable recipe for slow cooker roast that I've used more times over many years than I can count...and continue to go back to. It also works equally as well with a pork roast. Variations, of course, are endless, and I'm sure everyone will come up with their favorite way to make this. I always dredge a 3-4 pound roast in flour first, salt and peppered, then brown it on all sides in about 1/4 cup of butter. This adds so much to the flavor, and gives the roast great color as well. I use one can of cream of mushroom soup, one package of the dry onion soup mix, and 1/2 cup dry white wine -- no water at all! Tender, delicious, and gives your whole house a wonderful, homey smell in the process!","I thought maybe I did something wrong when I made this and it turned out terrible, but when my mom tried it and mentioned her horrible results, I decided it wasn't just me. I don't know why the reviews are so high, but this recipe isn't that great. The only thing that's great is that it's easy and quick to assemble. The flavor is pretty weak and the gravy was awful. I would never make this again and would rather do the extra work to have a roast that tastes yummy with gravy that IS gravy.","After reading and learning from most of the reviews I changed the recipe very slighlty and WOW, what a dish!!! I made this on mother's day for my mother in law and the entire family inhaled the dish within a blink of an eye. I marinated the tip roast the night before with minced garlic, pepper, and onion powder. The next day I slighlty browned the beef on all sides to lock in the flavors. I added half a cup of red wine and half a cup of beef broth, which replaced the cup of water. I added an onion and two garlic cloves on top. Also, I let it soo on low for about 9 hours. I made 6 pounds, but had no left overs!!!! Imagine that... My husband asked me to make some more just three days later!! Thanks everyone for your many tips and suggestions!! I still can't beleive that I impressed my mother in law!","I've made this a few times and I think I've just about perfected it (for me anyway)- just thought I'd share what I do: I flour a 5lb chuck roast (with the twine on) in a mix of season-all, pepper and flour and brown it all over. Then I plop it in the slow cooker. I deglaze the pan with a splash of zinfandel (any bold red wine will do - zinfandel or cabernet), scraping up all the brownings, then add another cup of the wine, mix in the package of dry onion soup mix, throw in a can of beef broth and a can of cream of mushroom soup, pour that over the roast. Add onions, potatoes and carrots all around and on top, and throw in a few sprigs of thyme, put the lid on and let it go all day. When I get home I remove the roast and veggies, cut off the twine, throw away the thyme sprigs and cook the liquid with more of the flour blend until I get a rich gravy. I serve with buttermilk biscuits. SO SO SO FABULOUS!!!!!","I read a BUNCH of reviews, and then did this....Used 1 can of Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup. Mixed it with 1 envelope of Lipton Onion soup mix, 1/2 cup beef broth, and 2 Tbsp. worchestershire sauce. Generously sprinkled Montreal Steak seasoning all over a 5 lb. bottom round roast, then coated it in flour. Browned it on all sides, put it in the crockpot. De-glazed saute pan with 1/2 cup beef broth. Poured the onion soup mix over/around the roast, then poured the de-glazing liquid over that. Cooked on LOW for 8 hours. FABULOUS!! The roast was super-tender, but not mushy (you could still cut it into slices). Perfect amount of gravy (about 1 quart) with a nice meaty, ""brown"" flavor, with no need to thicken up with flour or cornstarch. One of the best comfort foods there is! To sum up other's suggestions...only one can of soup? YES!! GOLDEN MUSHROOM soup? YES!! Monteal Steak seasoning? YES!! Dredge roast in flour? YES!! Beef broth instead of water? YES!! Don't add veggies to this dish? YES!! Try this recipe this way (add mashed potatoes, veggies etc. seperately, keeping the meat and gravy tasting, well, like meat and gravy should!). You will love it!!","Awesome!! After reading numerous reviews, I followed the advice of others. I floured, seasoned and browned my half-frozen roast (which was 3/5 lbs.), used the same amount of gravy ingredients, also added 4 cloves minced garlic and worcestershire sauce. About half way through I added a chopped onion. I let it cook on low for about 10 hrs. It was juicy and fell apart. The gravy was fantastic (especially on garlic mashed potatoes). I'm not a huge roast fan, nor do I like mushrooms but I served this for company and everyone (including kids from 5-16 yrs.) kept raving. Thank you, this is a definite keeper!","I made this recipe for my family and they thought this was awesome, by far the best pot roast I've made. I did make some revisions, taking into account comments of previous raters. I added a 2 lb bag of baby carrots (probably could of just used 1 pound), 6 or 7 small whole red potatoes, 4 quartered onions, several chopped celery sticks, 4 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic (we LOVE garlic), 3/4 c. red wine instead of the water (DEFINITELY a good suggestion), crushed peppercorns, 3 bay leaves. I mixed the wine and soups together, poured some of the mixture over the veggies, then put the meat in, then poured the rest of the soup mixture on the meat. Finish with plenty of crushed peppercorns over the top!! I also cooked it for 6 hours. Definitely the BEST I've ever tasted.","This has been my recipe for the past 3 years now. Everyone I feed it to loves it. A few things I have noticed during my reign as roast queen. First, it doesn't need to be defrosted fully. For some reason, it cooks just as well and retains moisture . Second, I love whole grain mustard as a binder for the seasonings. When I am dumping (horrible word choice I know) all of the soup and mix into the pot. I use the mustard to keep the good stuff on the meat. I also score the meat and stuff garlic in the slots. Fresh ground pepper and rosemary are the last to go in. About an hour from when I serve it, I add a cup of a good red wine (its like the last kick that makes it wow). It also doesn't hurt to drink a glass to reward myself for the awesome meal I am about to give. Serve with smashed taters and broccoli and cheese sauce and I have a very happy table.","This recipe is not only very user friendly it is delicious. It comes out nice and tender-full of flavor. Obviously you can cut recipe in half if you are not having guests. I added carrots, celery, potatoes, and mushrooms about 2 hours before serving. Just dont add them too early on or they will get mushy. :)","I've made this recipe several times, it is just that good!!!! The first time I try a recipe (especially if I rate it!!!) I always follow the recipe to a ""T"".... and the next time I modify it to suit my taste. I've rated this 5 stars ""as is"" for ease and deliciousness!!! It's fantastic as written.... I've done some things differently along the way though: I use beef broth instead of water, and I season and sear the meat before adding to the crockpot. One thing about this recipe is it makes ALOT of gravy.... So what??? I take the leftover gravy and freeze it! Our fav use for the leftover gravy is to put it in a saute pan, stir in about a 1/4 cup of sour cream, heat it up with some oven baked meatballs and serve it over egg noodles, with a salad on the side! My 9 year old eats it up! But I digress... :) Bottom line: this is wonderful as written but you can definitely tailor it to your tastes! I love recipes like that! :))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

23,"I know I'm just another in a long line of reviewers, but I enjoyed this recipe just as much as everyone else! I didn't read through all the reviews, but from most of them I gathered modifications, which added up to a winning recipe! - I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. - I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix. - I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg. - I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. Plus, I love celery, so I chopped up some of that and added it in. Finally, I used a cup of season bread crumbs instead of the crackers. Being impatient and hungry, I followed another user's idea and made mini-loves in my muffin pan. I put the ketchup/brown sugar sauce on bottom, cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, then spooned the rest of the sauce on top and cooked another 15. This was so delicious, I can't wait to make it again - this time in actual loaf form. Yum yum!","I think the brown sugar and ketchup should be on top of the meatloaf, not in the bottom of the pan. When I sliced the meatloaf, the brown sugar/ketchup mixture remained in the bottom of the pan, so I tried to invert the pan so that the mixture would drain into and flavor the meatloaf. This was a disaster - the sauce splattered all over the kitchen. I just don't see the point of having the brown sugar/ketchup in the bottom of the pan as it didn't flavor the meat much. It should be on top.","Delicious. I did make one alteration though. I don't like to make meatloaf in a loaf pan as i find the meat just sits in the grease. I formed my meat loaf, put it in a large casserole dish and put the glaze on the top. I was able to drain the grease 3 or 4 times during the cooking process. The glaze remained in tact and the meat came out moist and delicious.",Very good. I placed two slices of bread in the bottom of the loaf pan. (I saw this on Foodnetwork)The bread absorbs the grease. Then I placed the meatloaf on top of the bread. I mixed the brown sugar and ketchup and spread it on top of the meatloaf and placed 4 thick slices of good bacon on top. I turned out very good. Thanks. Joyln,This recipe was fabulous!!!! Instead of spreading the ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan I mixed them together and used it as a glaze on top of the loaf and it came out beautifully. I won't be using any other meatloaf recipe again!,"Yummy!! Best meatloaf I ever made. I did use onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion and only 1/4 c. milk, thought the mixture was moist enough and didnt want it to be too mushy. I also took the advise of other reviewers and used only 1/4 c. of the brown sugar and a few splashes of worcestshire with the ketchup and spread this on top of the meatloaf. Very tasty....thanks for a fabulous recipe, Starbuck!!","This was excellent! I took reviewers' suggestions and used only 1/2 cup of milk, and added garlic and 1 tblsp worcestershire to the beef. I used about 1/4+ cup of brown sugar, the catsup, and yes, a tbls of worcestershire to the glaze. Outstanding, and rave reviews.","I am not a meatloaf eater, but I found this recipe to be absolutely wonderful! My husband agreed (and he's a picky eater). I did have to tweak the ingredients a little. I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2; ground turkey instead of ground beef; 1 packet of onion soup mix instead of a chopped onion; and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers. I also mixed the ketcup and brown sugar into a glaze and used it on top of the meatloaf. I let the glaze cook on the meat for the last 15 minutes of oven time. It was great!","This is very close to a recipe my mom made often, the only difference being she added some mustard(dry spice works nice) and worchestershire to the brown sugar/ketchup mixture. (We put it on top too.) That might add some zing for those that found this recipe a lil bit too sweet. I also add garlic to the meat as another reader did, as I'm a Garlic-holic myself. ;)","I increased the recipe to feed 12 & then cooked most in the called-for loaf pan & the rest in a mini loaf pan. Per reviews, I made the following changes (I gave 4 stars to the recipe as written but w/ the help of the other reviewers this was 5 star).... I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar & I did add a couple tbp. of worcestershire to the sauce. I added a pkt of onion soup mix & used half chopped onion. Decreased teh milk to 1/2 cup (remember I have increased the recipe by half) & I only put a little bit of the sauce on bottom, using most of it on top. I also used half ground beef & half ground turkey. This was moist, flavorful & hubby said it beats out his recipe. Thank you Starbuck & fellow reviewers! I served it w/ roasted sweet potatoes & onions & a salad....cherry salad (from allrecipes) for dessert.","My husband is a meatloaf conneisseur. I, on the other hand, can't stand the stuff. However, his arrival home from the war in Iraq prompted me to make this as his homecoming meal: good old-fashioned, USA comfort food. Meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The only problem is, I didn't have a recipe for it. I searched on allrecipes.com, read the ratings and reviews for each recipe, only wanting to make the BEST for my dear hubby. Alas, I picked this recipe out of all the others and made it. My very first attempt at making meatloaf! It was easy to follow and my husband almost fainted when he realized what he was getting for dinner! He LOVED it and even more amazing, I (the world's biggest anti-meatloaf person) loved it as well. This is our new favorite dinner, and I really want to thank you all for rating this, which drew my attention to it-most of all, I want to thank Starbuck for posting this recipe!!!",Very Yummy. I did what others did after reading ALL of the reviews. (yes it took me a long time lol) I mixed the ketchup and brown suger together with a dash of worstechire sauce and placed on the bottom and the top of the meatloaf. I also used onion soup mix instead of raw onion. Added Worstechire sauce and garlic to the meatloaf mixture. Lowered the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Lowered the milk to 1/4 cup. Used bread Crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. AND I cooked it 1 1/2 hours. I like my meatloaf well done with no pink. Seems like a lot of changes but after reading the reviews this is what I felt I needed to do. YUMMY!!!!,"I don't know how I missed reviewing this! I HATE meatloaf. I can't stand it. I LOVE this recipe! I did make changes based on everyone else's reviews. Here's what I did: 1.) I cut the brown sugar in the sauce in half 2.) I added a Tablespoon of Worcestshire sauce to the sauce. 3.) I put the sauce on top of the meatloaf. 4.) I only used 1/2c. milk, not 3/4c. 5.) I used seasoned salt instead of table salt. 6.) I used 1 package of dry onion soup mix instead of an onion. 7.) I used Progresso Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. With these changes, I made the BEST meatloaf I have ever eaten (and like I said, I don't even like meatloaf!). This has become a weekly request. Thank you! I am so happy I found this recipe!","I've made this a number of times now and I have learned a few lessons: First use a flat jelly roll pan, it gives you more delicious crust and glaze and keeps the loaf from stewing in its own fat. Second, line the pan with aluminum foil, otherwise you will have a sticky mess that you cannot soak off. Third, put the brown sugar glaze on top, it flavors the loaf more. Fourth, use coarse ground chunk, lots of flavor and the coarse makes it easier for you to mix the loaf lightly.","I wasnt exactly impressed with this recipe for the simple fact that I have been topping my meatloaf with equal parts of brn sugar & ketchup for years. The meatloaf its self was pretty boring and I think I was looking for some umph. So I made it a second time added kc masterpiece BBQ seasoning, garlic worcestershire, and some italian bread crumbs, chopped green pepper, red onion, paprika, oregano, basically I kept adding until I had the smell I wanted . Turned out better with more zest to match the topping. My family thought it was spot on. Save yourself the hassle mix the brown sugar and ketchup and just top your meatloaf halfway through. So much easier with the same taste result. So I will continue to make with these changes and that vaults this into a 5 star in my book. My 8 and 5 year old boys ate more than I did exclaiming how I should make it again. BBQ seasoning in the meatloaf is a must! Make in cupcake pans and top with mashed potatoes that have been died with pureed beets for the perfect April fools dinner.",AWESOME. I'm in with the rest though. Put the brownsugar/ketchup on top instead of bottom. Couple shakes of worstshire in meat. Hour later. CHOW DOWN. Thanks...,"My favorite recipe from Allrecipes! Most meatloafs taste like hamburgers but this one is better. I used 1/4 br. sugar, 1 egg and omitted the milk. I added 1 garlic clove, 1 TBL worchester sauce, packet of onion mix instead of raw onion. The cracker crumbs could also be replaced with seasoned bread crumbs. We sure to put bread end pieces on the bottom to soak up the grease plus it's helpful if the meatloaf is overcooked, the bread prevents the bottom from being burnt. I don't bother doing layers, it is easier to mix everything with the ground beef and it still tastes great!","The key to making this recipe AMAZING is to listen to the most helpful reviews. If you do what the top 5 most helpful reviews say to do, then this meatloaf can't get much better!! For convenience, here are the recommended changes: 1. Use the brown sugar and ketchup as a GLAZE instead of putting them on the bottom. Use 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup, add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, mix these 3 ingredients separately, and pour it on top of the formed loaf evenly (I recommend putting some on the sides of the loaf, too). 2. For the meatloaf mixture, use 1/2 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup, and use 1 egg instead of 2. Also add in 2 cloves of minced garlic. 3. Use a 9x9 casserole dish (or bigger) instead of a loaf pan. Form the meatloaf so that there is at least 1/2 inch of space on all sides. Not only does this allow the glaze to be applied all around the meatloaf, but it also makes draining the excess juices easier. 4. After 30 minutes of cooking (halfway through), drain excess juices, let it finish cooking, then drain again if need be. 5. OPTIONAL: Add strips of bacon on top of the glaze before cooking. When you take the dish out to drain after 30 minutes, flip the bacon strips. Flipping the bacon in the glaze may seem awkward and messy, but it turns out beautifully when the cooking is finished. My wife, who normally hates meatloaf, LOVED this.","Sorry, but we didn't like this at all.","I was very surprise by this one .I fellow the recipe just as its written .So I will rate it.as so 4 1/2 Star .texture was very nice ,ginger did a lot for the taste. Sauce was sweet and very tasty .I use lean beef but if you do the sugar and sauce on the bottom I would recommend very lean beef, because you are not able to drain any fat off as the recipe is done .For taste this is a 5 star for me but if you have a savory loving person in your home they may not care for it as much as my family did . Milk and saltine may need to be adjusted to get the right texture but it was very close to perfect .Next time I make this I will put brown sugar and sauce on top, So that I can drain off the fat if it is too much I may even heat some ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar in a pan to serve on the side as a sauce to use on the meat loaf. Hope this help and thank for a great and differ meat loaf","This is the best meatloaf I have ever had or made. The brown sugar is what does it! I ran out of ketcup so I ended up using half BBQ sauce/half ketchup and it was fantastic. I may just do that on purpose next time! For those reviewers who didn't like the idea of the sauce on the bottom, you are mistaken! The sauce on the bottom marinates the meat almost thoroughly because its melds with grease (necessary for juicy meatloaf) and keeps the meat moist and flavorful. Putting the sauce on top only allows the oven heat to dry it out. Trust me. Don't change anything about this recipe! I will never use another meatloaf recipe again. Oh and one last thing, I always serve with mashed potatoes!","This is a really sweet version of regular meatloaf...I loved it. Instead of putting all of the brown sugar at the bottom of the pan, I mixed it up with the meat. Gave that sweet flavor to the entire dish. It was great.","This meatloaf is excellent! My entire family loved it! I didn't follow the recipe exactly as directed. I forgot the milk, and did not add ginger as I did not have any. I did not think the recipe was too sweet, although we do enjoy sweet foods. Instead of layering the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I mixed it together, and combined about 2/3 of the mixture in with the meat mixture, then brushed the remaiming sauce over top of the meatloaf before cooking. It was excellent! After taking his first bite, my 4 year-old said, MOM, THIS IS AWESOME!!! :) This is definetly a keeper!","My family loved this recipe, and I have requests to make it again. We have a gluten allergy, so instead of saltine cracker crumbs, I substituted gluten free crackers.","If you put the ingredients into the loaf tin then place upside down onto a baking sheet, bake for 15 mins then remove the loaf tin you have a perfect loaf right side up, then brush the ketchup, brown sugar (I add half teas dry mustard to it) then continue baking. I also add teaspoon of dry mustard and 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.","This was really just okay for us. I made as written, except that I too put the glaze on the top of the meatloaf the last 15 mins of cooking. It was just a tad bit bland for our taste. We added ketchup to it on our plate, which helped some, but still wasnt a favorite. Thanks!","Excellent meatloaf!My whole family loved it.My husband took a bite and said ""You did something different to the meatloaf.""I told him ""Yes, it's a new recipe.""He said ""It's better"".Everyone asked for more.The only things I changed about the recipe was to divide the brown sugar and ketchup between the top and bottom instead of putting it all on the bottom.I didn't use lean ground beef and used a little more salt and pepper than the recipe called for, but not much.The meatloaf turned out very moist and yummy.There were no leftovers and they were all fighting over the last piece.If you are NOT using very lean ground beef, do NOT add as much milk as the recipe calls for because it won't need it. Great recipe! A real kid and husband pleaser!",,,,,,,,,
24,"Try RICOTTA CHEESE instead of sour cream and skip the provolone for a real Italian version of Baked Ziti. Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don't need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then repeat layers. For a really nice look, slice a brick of mozzarella for the top layer instead of using the shredded kind. This is SO MUCH BETTER than the sour cream version!","Hey yo, what's up fellow cookers?? Check it...I hate when people give extraordinary recipes ratings that they don't deserve. I sort my recipies by ""most helpful."" Every person that I know who knows anything about cooking KNOWS to cover up whatever it is that they are baking so it won't dry up. Now that I got that off my chest, I just want to say that this is definitely ""HALL OF FAME"" material. I didn't make any changes to the recipe with the exception of how I layered it. I read some of the other reviews and decided to put the sauce mixture directly on top of the ziti, then add the cheese, sour cream and so forth. I even stirred the bottom layer of ziti and sauce together before I added anything else just to make sure that the sauce ran all through the noodles. I may try Ricotta cheese next time just to see the difference in taste or may mix Ricotta with the sour cream. Grease the pan real well before you put anything in it....or just use a non-stick cooking spray. If you like your meals cheesier, meatier or saucier, than you can add a little more, but that's strictly on your preference. Oh yeah.......keep in mind that this meal does make a huge dish so you might want to have a smaller baking dish on the side for any extra that doesn't fit in the first one. Better safe than sorry.....and trust...YOU WON'T BE SORRY FOR MAKING THIS AT ALL!!!!","I'm rating this only a 3 star because the recipe doesn't tell you to bake it COVERED! I baked uncovered and it dried out. Not good, and certainly not ""Hall of Fame"" worthy. I'll try it again, but definitely covered when baking.","Just made this dish for dinner tonight and it was delicious. Instead of greasing the pan (I used a Pyrex dish) with butter, I sprayed a light coating of Pam; the pan was a breeze to clean afterward. Per some of the suggestions other reviewers made, I added minced garlic and had put the sauce directly on the ziti, before the provolone. Because I like the pasta to soak up the flavor of the sauce, I did the same for the top layer ziti, (adding the sauce to the ziti before the mozerella cheese). Since I wasn't sure if doing so would make the pasta too soft, I shaved a minute off of the suggested pasta boiling time. It came out perfect, this recipe is a keeper.","I love this recipe! It gets five stars because, made as directed, it's absolutely delicious; creamy, savory and just perfect. If I could give this recipe more stars, I would, because it's also extremely flexible. I've made this with Italian sausage or ground turkey instead of the beef. I've also made a vegetarian version by substituting sliced zucchini and mushrooms for the meat. Sometimes I add chopped garlic and fennel seed. (There's something about fennel seed that, to me, is integral to Italian cooking. It's like cilantro to Mexican food.) Obviously, the key to the greatness of this recipe is the substitution of a layer of sour cream and provolone for the usual ricotta. That's what makes the dish so moist and creamy. Who hasn't make a beautiful lasagna only to have it dry out in the oven? I like ricotta as much as the next Italian-American, but the stuff is pretty dry and really adds no flavor. It's essentially just a binder. Here, the combination of the provolone melting into the sour cream is truly inspired; the sour cream adds moisture and the provolone adds flavor. I'm planning to use the same combo instead of ricotta in my next lasagna. The importance of using a high-quality sauce for this recipe almost goes without saying, so I'll stop here. Thanks, Colleen!","Rewrite of review - This was one of the first recipes I found on Allrecipes back in 2002. Just made it again last night for friends (including 2 kids..who including the adults..went for seconds) and family. This dish makes plenty of leftovers - pack them in tupperware and freeze for another night. Always a fantastic turnout with this dish!! Did make a few altercations though...as always: Didnt realize i picked up Penne pasta instead of Ziti at the store. I omitted the onions. Used hot italian turkey sausage (squeezed the meat out of the casings and cooked it like you'd cook ground beef). Seasoned the meat with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Mrs Dash. Added 2 TBS of minced garlic to browning meat. Added 1 (drained) can of mushroom pieces with stems. Added 2 jars of pasta sauce and let simmer for 15 mins. Halved the amount of (reduced fat/light) sour cream and replaced it with (reduced fat/light) ricotta. And used the rest of the ingredients off the recipe. Layered PAM sprayed Pyrex baking dishes like so...Ziti, sauce, Provolone, Sour Cream, Ricotta, ziti, rest of sauce and Sargento's Italian 6 Shredded Cheese Blend - Mozzarella, Provolone, Asiago and Parmesan. Covered with foil and baked for 30 mins. :) Yummmmy **TIP** Unless you have a big family or are having company...i suggest if you are feeding up to 4 people to half the recipe. Thanks Colleen for a great recipe!","This is great! I use 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound Italian sausage and add onion, green pepper and garlic while browning. I add 1 TBSP of Italian seasoning, sliced mushrooms and sliced black olives to the sauce. I mix the pasta and meat sauce together, place half the mixture in the pan, then the sour cream and 1/2 of the cheese, then the remaining ziti mixture and top with the remaining cheese. I like the pasta completely coated with sauce. I use shredded Italian blend cheese and PILE it on, at least double what the recipe calls for, and increase the Parmesan as well. Definitely use 2 jars of sauce, it sounds like a lot but other wise the Ziti will be dry. This is perfect for a family gathering, it makes a lot.","Delicious and great make-ahead recipe for entertaining. Read a ton of the reviews and recommend following changes suggested by others: use larger dish (31/2-4 qt.), saute several cloves of minced garlic w/meat and onion, add layer of sauce over ziti before provolone/sour cream layer, cover while baking so it doesn't dry out, if making ahead and refrigerating, be sure to double the cooking time. I used Bertolli Five Cheese spaghetti sauce with a little sugar and crushed red pepper -- excellent! If","This was a really good recipe. I wasn't able to find any sliced provolone cheese so I substituted it w/ a shredded cheese w/ provolone in it. It still came out great, but it was difficult to spread the sour cream. That was easily corrected by placing the sour cream in a zip lock bag, snipping a corner, and then evenly spreading it over the ingredients. Everyone in my family loved it!","This recipe was easy and good, and as other reviewers have said it is very similar to lasagna. I would make one change next time I make it and put the bottom layer of sauce dirctly on the noodles, then the cheese on top of that. When assembled as directed, the provolone cheese layer made a barrier and kept the sauce away from the noodles below and made for a layer of naked noodles at the bottom. I also ended up with extra sauce while assembling because it didn't settle down to the bottom. This recipe makes a VERY full 9X13 pan, and definitely use a well seasoned sauce (like tomato & basil) and the half & half ground beef and italian sausage. My 3 year old really like it too! Thank you!","The reason why I love this site, is to be able to try new recipes. If you are going to suggest making a completely different recipe in a REVIEWRATE, then submit your own recipe. It's not fair to the other person to have their version shot down completely. **I made this and took it to a family reunion this past summer....it was a big hit! Try it, you will be pleasantly surprised!**","This was delicious, the only thing I changed was the addition of salt and pepper and 2 cloves minced garlic. Side note: I've noticed many of the reviews who rated this recipe low had modified the ingredients, in particular using ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. I thought the sour cream added a wonderful flavor and feel there is already plenty of cheese flavor and no need for ricotta. Reviewers need to remember that when modifying or customizing ingredients of recipes to their own liking or opinion it is inappropriate to leave a poor or low review or rating.","Love this Ziti!!! Simple to prepare, flavorful, and very easy to modify based on your own family's preferences. I made the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of the spaghetti sauce. As I didn't have any, I defrosted John Chandler's sauce from his ""World's Best Lasagna"" listed on Allrecipes. I'm sure using his sauce made all the difference! Thanks Colleen for submitting this recipe!","Simply delicious! This is very easy to throw together and perfect for a hearty weeknight meal. So if your're in the mood for Italian but think you don't have the time - think again. I added 1/2 lb. of sausage to the ground beef and onion along with some fresh minced garlic. And, to the sauce I added a little red wine and some Italian seasoning to give a bit of a flavor boost. The sour cream was a nice change from the usual ricotta cheese and I just eyeballed the other cheeses when layering. I covered it and baked it a little longer than 30 minutes leaving it uncovered for the last 10 minutes. Great with garlic bread and a salad!","I've made this twice now: the first time with the ricotta substitution (per other reviews) and the second time with the sour cream (per the recipe). If you like a creamy sauce with your pasta, stick with the recipe. This was more to our taste and liking. Ricotta is too dry for Baked Ziti IMHO. I mixed half of the meat sauce with half of the ziti for first layer (stir to coat the ziti), added provolone and sour cream, then added the other half of the ziti and meat sauce. Topped with mozzarella and parmesan. Cook covered for 30 min, took foil off last 5 min to brown the cheese. It is super easy and tastes great, and worthy of company.","This was great!!! I modified a few things from reading other reviews. I changed the serving size to 4 and that filled a 9x13 pan alone! I also did half ground beef and half ground sausage and used garlic powder and oregano when I browned it. I also used half sour cream and half ricotta cheese. Came out really good. I love cheese so I used a whole 16oz. of mozzarella. With the sauce I used half in my meat mixture and mixed the other half with the ziti noodles so they were completely covered in and out. Also when you bake it, COVER it with foil and the last 5 minutes uncover it and broil it so it gets that nice crispy brown topping! I loved it and my husband did also! Definitely a keeper!!!","I hope you are still reading your reviews, Colleen, after at least 2 years. This is the BEST BAKED ZITI! Your recipe is WONDERFUL as it is written, not to be changed. The sour cream and provolone is what makes it SPECIAL and DIFFERENT. Don't substitute anything. I used ""Classico Sausage & Pepper"" sauce and it was perfect, I destroyed my old baked ziti recipe.","I was surprised at how good this was. I used organic, low fat sour cream; organic pasta sauce and 5% fat ground meat. I didn't expect much from this recipe but will definitely make this again. I think the sour cream did the trick. Now I'm wondering if sour cream would be a good replacement for ricotta in lasagne!","I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I must agree with a few of the other reviewers - the sour cream just doesn't fit the dish perfectly. I love sour cream, but I think the sour cream and provolone cheese would best be replaced by ricotta cheese. If you do that, and add in a little spinach, this becomes a very easy lasagna like dish. WARNING! This recipe fills a HEAPING 9x13 pan...so don't add anything unless you subtract something or it will not fit!! You could easily 1/2 this recipe and still generously feed a family of 4 and still have leftovers. Great staple to use in your regular menu rotation! Thanks!","This recipe Is WONDERFUL !!!. I Made this for dinner last night with garlic cheese bread - It was AWESOME !!! I used 1.5 lb.ground beef.I added the noodles to the meat sauce so it would soak into the noodles.Spray pan with cooking spray.I put half the pasta meat sauce in the pans (I used 2 pans because it made a lot) layered the provolone, sour cream and Mozzarella. Then put the rest of the pasta meat sauce on top and sprinkled with parmesan. Make sure you cover it with foil. I did add extra cheese - I like cheesy. The provolone was kind of hard to slice – next time I will have the deli slice it or buy it already sliced. YUMMY !!!!! (update) I gave this recipe to my sister and she said it was absolutely Wonderful !!! I froze half of it. I took it out of the freezer, put it into a casserole dish and covered with tin foil - baked at 350 for one hour YUMM!!!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe !!!!","GREAT Recipe! BUT you MUST cover the dish with foil before putting it in the oven. I spotted this issue with the recipe before making it, but an inexperienced cook may not. Also, Mix the Ziti with the Sauce prior to layering cheeses. I just mix my pasta and sauce together, then layer 1/2 pasta and sauce mix, provolone, sour cream, 1/2 pasta, mozzerella on top. It is great. You can also add kalamato olives and mushrooms to the sauce for great flavor bonuses. I use Classico brand Tomato & Basil Sauce. It's perfect with this recipe and two jars is jut the right amount. TRUST THE SOUR CREAM!! I do not use ricotta. It's too heavy and not worth it. The sour cream is simple and it tastes amazing when it's done. TRUST IT. I'll make this again, for sure. The whole family loved it.","This is a wonderful recipe, tastier than your standard baked ziti, in fact much tastier than any I've had from a restaurant. The addition of provolone and substitution of sour cream (for ricotta) really kick up the flavor and makes it more savory. My wife who never really cared for baked ziti loves this dish. We use the ""Old Italian Meat Sauce"" recipe on this website which is really good. A little bit of advice for everyone who thinks of using ricotta instead of sour cream. Stop!!! Don't!!!. Once you do that it's pretty much just the standard old boring recipe. The sour cream is integral to making this dish such a keeper.",This was a big hit with my family. I used a jar of Ragu sauce with Romano cheese flavoring and was very happy with the results!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,This recipe was excellent. I have made it twice already. I added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic just for a few minutes until the onions were softened. It was delicious!!!!! thanks,Good Stuff - I did follow the advice of other reviewers: 1. Sauted the onion 2. Use seasoned bread crumbs 3. Doubled the ketchup mixture and reduced the amount of mustard a tad 4. 1 tbsp Worstishire in the meat mix 5. Line the pan with foil for easy clean up 6. LET THE MEAT REST before slicing. Served it with Paula Deens Cottage Potato's and steamed vegetables. No complaints from the boys who were over for dinner. Went down well with a 2004 Pinot Noir. Will make this again.,"This was a great recipe. I compiled and followed all of the advice of previous reviewers: -I lightly browned the onions in butter before adding. -I also added chopped green onions, mushrooms, and a green bell pepper. -I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs. -I tripled the sauce (many said that there was not enough sauce/topping) and -I baked for longer than the recipe states (I baked for a total of one hour and 25 minutes). It came out perfectly. Thanks for the great recipe, and reviewers thanks for the great hints/amendments!","I have tried some more ""exotic"" meatloaf recipes on this site which have turned out quite good, but my husband wanted more of a basic meatloaf so that it would be good on a sandwich the next day. I chose this recipe based on the high marks and the easy ingredients. I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and followed the ""most helpful"" suggestions of sauteeing the onions in butter + garlic, and adding 1 Tbsp. of worchestshire to the meat mix. Other than that, followed the recipe completely, and it was wonderful!!! Very tasty and moist (one thing I can't stand is a dry meatloaf, not this one!) and I have a feeling it will make great meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow. Thanks for the post!",I made this recipe and altered it according to previous reviews: 1) I added Worcestershire Sauce 2)didn't have any fresh onion so I used minced 3)added garlic powder 4) added 1 slice of bread ripped into pieces since it seemed too wet when mixing 5)used a glass baking dish 6)doubled the topping 7)used seasoned bread crumbs. A 1.30# of meat cooked in an hour. This turned out great and we went back for seconds even when my man is sick and said he wasn't hungry! I personally thought the topping was a tad too sweet so I would do everything the same next time except reduce the brown sugar some. This was very easy and a big hit. Will definitely make again and again!!!,"YUMMY!!! Made this dish for company the other night and WOW! It was a BIG hit! My 6 yr old had 2 huge pieces and my hubby even had leftovers for breakfast the next morning while we were all still sleeping! I used 2-1/4lbs. of ground beef, kept the 1 onion(1 of my guests is not a big onion fan), 2 eggs, 1-1/2 cups of both milk and SEASONED breadcrumbs, threw in some garlic powder and parsley flakes and doubled the ketchup mixture. Seasoned breadcrumbs are a must for this recipe; Would be very bland without them. Thanks for the great recipe! :)","Hands down, this was the best meatloaf that I've ever made. I used about 2.3 lbs. of ground beef. Following some of the advice of others as well as adding a few of my own tweaks, the meatloaf was perfect. Here's what I did: 1. I sautéed finely chopped onion, 3 cloves (minced garlic) & 2 stalks of celery in butter (which really makes the loaf tender); then added it to the ground beef. 2. I added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture along with 2 eggs instead of 1, 1 1/4 cup of milk & about 1 1/2 cup of dried Italian bread crumbs. 3. For the sauce: I initially made it as the directions indicated with 2 TBSP. of brown sugar, and found it to be way too sweet. I then added 1/3 more ketchup and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and it was perfect. 4. It was an abundance of sauce, and a lot of the other reviews said that there wasn't enough sauce, so I spooned a thin layer at the bottom of the loaf, molded half the loaf, then sauced the top, and then added the rest of the loaf on top and sauced it really well. This was absolutely perfect. 5. Lastly, there was no specification on whether or not to cook the meatloaf covered or uncovered. I used enough aluminum foil to line the baking dish as well as cover the top (so I essentially wrapped the loaf in foil) and cooked covered for 45 minutes, drained most of any accumulated liquid and cooked uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. This was super moist and delicious!!!!!","I made this meatloaf with my boyfriend. Not only was it delicious but we had a lot of fun making it. At first i was worried that it would be too onion-y, but using the whole onion was well worth it. it was a dark dark scary night and i was home all alone, hungry and scared, all of the sudden the hunger kicked in and i walked in the kitchen, opened the fridge and there it was, a big juicy hunk of meat with onions, pepper, and one medium sized egg. without a second thought i clenched my teeth into it and mmmmmmmmm oh my lord it was so meaty and loafy. my night was made. it just... just... magical.","This recipe was definitely easy to make but I wasn't sure of the brown sugar mixture that goes on top and sure enough when my husband tried it, he said it was like eating desert and dinner at the same time. He said it was way to sweet and that he couldnt taste the meat b/c of all the breadcrumbs. May want to cut back to less than 3/4 cup. He made me promise not to make this again. Personally, I thought it was ok.","This is the same recipe that I have used for years. My son only likes ketchup on his, but the rest of us love the sweet/tangy sauce. I also add 8 saltine crackers crumbled into crumbsand reduce the bread crumbs by the amount of crackers and a small minced cut carrot to it. This is a very good and moist recipe. This recipe also does well with green pepper or mushrooms added to it.",Sorry But this was the worst Meatloaf I ever tasted! Although my dogs loved it!!,"Whoops! The recipe submission lists 2 tablespoons brown sugar, not the 2 cups we published. We have revised the recipe to include the correct amount. We apologize for the inconvenience.","Don't be discouraged by the unimaginative ingredient list. I made this recipe exactly as instructed, adding some worcestershire to taste, but I think it would be fine without it. The raw onions give a perfect crunch, I would not pre cook them. The flavor punch comes from the perfect sauce, my family loved it. I look for good meat loaf recipes like I look for the perfect purse. And this is IT for me. It would be good to use it as a base for adding whatever else you wanted, but I don't want to mess with a good thing. This is IT for all you cooks.","Absolutely love this recipe! It was so easy to make and so delicious!! My boyfriend and I both had seconds it was so good. I did some altering to the recipe, which I thought made it even better. I listened to the other reviewers and sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic powder. I also did half a cup of crushed Ritz crackers and half a cup of Italian Seasoned bread crumbs. I added a 1oz packet of Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning for flavor. For the topping I did 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup sweet baby rays bbq sauce and 1 tbs regular mustard. I had bbq sauce on meatloaf at a really nice restaurant and it gave me the idea, the combination is perfect!!!","I would like to read reviews of THIS recipe. When you alter THIS recipe, you have created a NEW recipe.","Almost identical to the Ranch House Meat Loaf recipe I use. I use 2 lbs gr. beef, 1 cup cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs (trust me it is better), 2 eggs, 1/2 cup onion, 3/4 of 10 oz. can of beef broth (instead of milk), 1 tsp. sage, 1 tsp. thyme and 1/4 tsp. pepper. For topping: 3 tbsp. brown sugar, 4 tbsp. ketchup and 1 tsp. dry mustard. Bake meatloaf at 325 for 1 1/4 hours. Remove from pan and place on plate (this gets the meatloaf out of the grease for the final cooking). Put topping on meatloaf and return to oven for additional 30 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!!","This meatloaf was great! I did as some of the other reviewers did, I tweaked a few items. B 4 cooking I read some reviews about the meat being too mushy. The trick to solve this problem is to put two slices of bread in the bottom of the pan before the meatloaf. Also, use 1 packet of Lipton's onion soup instead of real onions. And to give the meat a nice flavor, use 1 tblspn of Worstcestershire sauce. Instead of using 1 cup of milk, use 1/4 cup. My family loves a more firm meatloaf and this was perfect. After dinner, my hubby fell right to sleep! :-) Guess that's what GOOD comfort food does to ya.","This is a great, classic meatloaf, and the topping mixture is delicious! However, using all ground beef resulted in a very dense and sort of chewy meatloaf. I would advise using a ""meatloaf mix"" of either beef & pork or beef, pork and lamb. Many grocery stores sell a mix like this already pre-packaged, but you can always just buy them separately and mix them together. I used such a mix when I made this for the second time, and it resulted in a meatloaf that was moist and had a more pleasing texture. I did add about 15 minutes to the baking time. Other than that, I loved it and will make it again!","Very tasty meatloaf but came out really mushy for me because I didn't let it sit long enough after it came out of the oven. It needs to sit for at LEAST 10 minutes, this definitely should be in the directions. I took other reviewers advice and did the following: 1) added garlic powder and worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. 2) Used less brown sugar in the topping mixture (probably more like 1 tbsp of sugar). I also used crushed white cheddar Cheese-Its instead of breadcrumbs, gives it a nice cheesy flavor. Some reviews say to double the amount of topping, which is true, it does need more, but I would suggest reserving some of the sauce and warming it up at very low heat in a saucepan. Then, drizzle over the meatloaf after you slice and plate it. Yummy sauce!","This was very good! I read through the reviews and took a few tips and added some of my own. First, I used ground chuck (80/20). It had a wonderful flavor and consistency. I think ground beef would be mushy and ground sirloin might turn out too chewy so watch that. Ground Round would work ok too. I minced my onions very fine and they were great. I did add several splashes of woscheshire and some garlic powder to the mix. I doubled the sauce (but not the sugar) and I thought it was fantastic. I baked this in a foiled lined glass dish that was round and I poked a hole in the middle of the raw meatloaf with the end of a wooden spoon before the sauce went on to facilitate even cooking. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours on 350, took it out of the oven, drained away some of the fat that collected and then most importantly I tented it with foil and let it rest for 10 mins before slicing into it. You have to let the meat juices redistribute so resting is an important step. Also, the temp of the meat continues to rise another 5-10 degrees so you know your food is properly cooked. So what I ended up with was a moist, succulent restaurant quality meatloaf that looked and sliced great and tasted even better. This is the ultimate comfort food. This recipe easily serves 4 and makes great left overs. Thanks everybody! Enjoy.",Really enjoyed this meatloaf. I added a few tablespoons of worcestershire sauce and a little garlic powder. I also made 3 small loaves instead of one big one. It cut down on the cooking time from 1 hour and 15 to about 50 minutes or so.,"I struggled for a long time to find a perfect meatloaf recipe. The famly always claimed my meatloaf was good, but I never cared for it. First time I made this meatloaf everyone just raved about it, including the more picky eaters. I did add a dash of low sodium wortceshire sauce. This is a keeper and will be my main meatloaf from now on.","I LOVE this recipe! It tastes great and is easy. The only modifications that I made were to: 1) Leave out the ketchup 2) Put the brown sugar in with the meat and other ingredients (a mistake the turned out to be great) 3) Use BBQ sauce as a glaze 4) Bake it in muffin cups By baking it in muffin cups, we were able to get 12 servings out of it, which helps with portion control, because when I slice meatloaf, there's never enough for two meals. Great recipe that I'd certainly recommend to others.","I tried this several times to see if I could tweak the recipe to something less sweet/more solid. The basic meatloaf ingredients are right but the ketchup/sugar/mustard sauce is way too sweet even for someone with a sweet tooth. I doubled the ketchup as other reviewers suggested but I don't think you need to add any sugar to it. I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup which helped a lot, kept the bread crumbs at 1 cup. My only other suggestion is to maybe increase the ground beef to 2 lbs or find a really lean 90% and above ground beef so that the natural fat in it doesn't make it so greasy. If you want to use this recipe, I recommend leaving the sugar out and using lean ground beef.","This is a very delicious, basic recipe. I would have given it 5 stars, but I made a few alterations which prevented it from being on the bland side. I added about a tablespoon or so of Worcestershire sauce (I just eyeballed it), used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain, sautéed the onion with a few cloves of freshly minced garlic, added some fresh chopped parsley into the meatloaf, and I added about a tablespoon of BBQ sauce to the glaze just to give it a little more dimension. And for my tastes, I used a teaspoon each of salt and pepper (if anyone wondered how much should be recommended). Don't forget to double the sauce! **Also, here's a helpful tip on how to cook it. Free-form the loaves, and place them on a cookie cooling rack. Line a large cookie sheet/baking pan with foil, and place the cooling rack on top of the baking pan. This will allow the fat/drippings from the meatloaf to fall onto the bottom of the pan, so any draining/soaking will not be necessary.** The original recipe yields a pretty good meatloaf, very moist and with the right proportions...but the modifications made it even better! It was my first time making it, and I even made my grandma proud. :)",I thought this was a great recipe! I added the worcestershire and cooked the onion as previous posters said. I cooked it 1 hour in a pampered chef stone loaf pan and it was a little underdone. I think 1 hr 15 would have been perfect.,,,,,,,,,,

27,Five stars and an A+. This is the perfect basic sloppy joes recipe. I won't be buying the canned stuff anymore. We like ours just a little stickier so added 1/2 cup water and a tablespoon of quick oats then simmered it down. MMM Next time I'm going to double it so I can freeze the extra. I fill the cups in a muffin tin with the leftovers and freeze. When frozen just pop them out and store in a Ziploc bag in the freezer. Each one is the perfect size for a bun and ready to microwave at a seconds notice.,Best sloppy joes ever! My boyfriend absolutely loved it...instead of 3/4 cup of ketchup I only used 1/2 and replaced the other 1/4 with barbecue sauce. It turned out perfect..not too ketchupy or anything...oh and I also skipped the brown sugar - only because the barbecue sauce I was using already had brown sugar in it.,"I browned the ground beef, onion and green pepper. I then put the remaining ingredients into a crock pot and cooked on low for about 3-4 hours. This recipe was really simple & delicious.","This is wonderful! My family loves this when I slice the top off hogie buns, hollow out the shell, stuff with the hot Sloppy Joe meat, top with cheese and broil until the cheese melts. Save the bread from the buns for crumbs or whatever you need them for. I freeze mine.","Much better than Manwich and SO easy! The best thing is it's made with ingredients I always have in the house and it's not a hundred ingredients either so it's fast to make. I always make more sauce than it calls for, I think it's too dry otherwise. If I make it with 1 lb. of meat I double the sauce, 2 lbs. I triple it, 3 lbs. I quadruple it, etc. It's great in the crockpot too; I make it in the morning when I have a minute and it sits in the crockpot on low all day. I've passed this recipe on to anyone who will take it.","Absolutely delicious. This is the perfect recipe for sloppy joes in my opinion. People complain about the reviews being overrated because this isn't all jazzed-up into something special. Well what do you expect, it's only sloppy joes! I haven't had sloppy joes in years, and I am so glad I chose this recipe to finally have a taste of some. The only thing I would definitely change is the simmer time. Even on the lowest fire I had to cut it down to 20 min. instead of the original 30 because it started sticking to the pan. But it was finished by then any way and the flavors have already come out from the seasonings. This was AWESOME! A definite keeper. If you would like to simmer for the full 30 min, follow the advice of others and add just a bit of water and/or extra ketchup. This also adds more sloppiness. Yum!","Our family loves this recipe (I make it a lot). I have to double it for my family of five (makes great leftovers, if there are any). I also add 2-3 tsp of white vinegar, a tsp of Worcestershire sauce, and some tomato paste. Quick, simple, and DEEEELICIOUS!","This is a wonderful, easy basic recipe, as the high ratings can attest. However, for those who tend to find this too sweet, don't add the brown sugar until the last, at the same time you adjust the S&P. If you find it doesn't need the sugar, skip it; or add just a tiny bit at a time until you like it. Or try 1/2-1 tsp. molasses instead of the br. sugar to add depth of flavor without much sweetness. Still too sweet? You might also need to substitute tomato sauce for the ketchup (in which case you might want to add a bit of additional spices.) If you have already made the recipe as listed, and find it too sweet, DON'T THROW IT OUT! Remember that acids are sour and will offset the sweetness. Therefore, add a splash of vinegar or unsweetened tomato products (such as tomato paste or chopped tomatoes) a little at a time until the sweetness is corrected to your tastes. Then follow the steps above next time you make this. Don't pass up this quick, easy, tasty recipe without tweaking it to suit your family's tastes! :)","This went over big at the fire station. Adjusted the recipe for ten and barely fed 8!! To make the sauce a little ""sloppier"" instead of addind more ketchuo, I added chicken gumbo soup.",this was so simple and just plain tasty. good recipe for good old fashion sloppy joe.,Much better than Manwich!,"really good! i put the mixture in a 8x8 pan and layered shredded cheddar cheese on top. then i made the Golden Sweet Cornbread (on this site) batter and poured it over the beef mixture and cheese, baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. insta-meal!","This was a big hit at our super bowl party... I exchanged the hamburger for ground turkey... I promise you NO ONE could tell the difference and I certainly didn't tell anyone! I did add a little water after it simmered awhile but that was it, Definitely will never buy the canned stuff again!!!","This one always makes EVERYone happy! :) I add a tsp of liquid smoke, 1/2 c. bbq sauce and a tbsp of apple cider vinegar for a little zing. Then I mix a little mayo, garlic salt & parmesan cheese & spread it onto the buns. Add jack cheese to one side & broil until bubbley, then top with sloppy joe. A favorite in our house for sure! I'll never by Manwich again!! Thanks! :)","Sloppy Joes elevated! Such a quick easy recipe to make and modify to one's taste buds. Too sweet, use less brown sugar. Want spicier, use 1/2 ketchup and chili sauce. Health conscience, use ground turkey. Thanks to Arnolddirr for the freezing method tip using muffin tins and to Tamara the submitter of this recipe.","I made this for the varsity/JV basketball teams (35 kids!) and it was a HUGE hit!! 10 pounds of ground beef later, one boy said it was the best meal yet! I did use 1/2 ketchup and 1/4 barbeque sauce, put everything in the crockpot on low for 6 hours. Success!","I forgot to pick up a canned sloppy joe mix and turned to all recipes. This recipe had so many reviews and such a high rating with simple ingredients I knew I'd give it a shot. Well, it brings flashbacks to the days when people made things from scratch. Funny thing is...it really takes maybe 5 minutes longer to assemble than sloppy joes using a canned sauce and it tastes unbelievable! You have to try it!","These sloppy joes immediately moved into first place at our house, knocking my once-favorite recipe out of the running! Everyone loved the not-too-sweet, not-too-tangy flavor and rich, thick consistency. I made it exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing! To save time, I prepare the mixture several hours ahead of time and keep it warm in a slow-cooker until dinner. I have also tried quadrupling the recipe for a crowd and it works great, affecting neither flavor nor texture.","Everyone is right, this is a winner! I made two batches today using 6 lbs. of ground chuck in each batch. I stock the freezer for future use. To cut the fat, I cook just the meat and then pour very hot water over it and drain. Next, I added the raw onion & peppers and the remaining ingredients and simmer for a couple of hours. There is so much flavor going on that you'll never miss the fat.","I give these the highest rating because it tasted great, it was easy to make, and it consists of everything you'd have on hand. Sloppy Joes shouldn't be a gourmet affair, it should be a quick-to-make weeknight meal that tastes good. These are the only ones I will be making from now on.",added a few extras but the original recipe is excellent!,"Added a couple Tablespoons of hubby's favorite BBQ sauce, a teaspoon of Goya Seasonings, a couple dashes of Chili Powder and a couple teaspoons of Worcestershire Sauce, I used red bell pepper instead of green, and used 2t of brown sugar instead of 3 and instead of Garlic Powder, I used 2 minced fresh cloves of garlic and added that after the meat, onion and pepper were cooked and drained so as not to burn the garlic and simmered covered only 20 minutes instead of 30. So freaking good! My husband said its the best Sloppy Joe's he has ever had and me too! Thanks for this basic recipe with all ingredients usually on hand! Love it and love this recipe! Will be a regular in our rotation!","This sloppy joe is the BOMB. I will NEVER eat Manwich again. By far it is killing Manwich. When I make this, it is amazing and it's so hard to stop eating it! I use 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup of sweet baby rays bbq sauce per pound....MM MM MM! I also use red and green peppers. TERRIFIC!","This was good, but not my favorite. It was a little bit too sweet for us. I also didn't really like the green bell pepper taste with it. I think I will keep using my own recipe. Thanks for the post.",Best sloppy joes ever! Only additions - red pepper for kick and a little water to simmer. Kids loved it and I loved it because all ingredients were in my kitchen. Will never use powder mix again.,My family loved it! One review stated it was better than canned sloppy joe mixes and they were absolutely correct and who doesn't have these ingredients on hand all the time!! So easy. Only change I made was adding a bit of worchestershire sauce. I would recommend 1 tsp and tasting to see if you prefer a bit more. I added about 3 tsps. This will be own only sloppy joe recipe now! Thank you so much for sharing and I highly recommend a test of this one! :O),"I love this recipe! I usually add extra ketchup, as the boys in our family are ketchup maniacs and we like our sloppy joe's really saucy. I've probably made this recipe 50 times over the last few years, and everyone loves it. It's easy, fast, and really cheap!",,,,,,,,,

30,"I took some advice from pervious reviewers and made sure that I fried the chops until the outside was very crispy (make sure the oil is hot before adding the chops, makes a difference in how tender they turn out). I also doubled the gravy, and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom. That really helped keep the dish from having that ""some kind of meat covered w/cream of mushroom soup"" taste. I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms in the pan I'd cooked the pork in and added them to the soup mixture. I added some extra garlic and just a couple dashes of cayenne. I cooked the chops for 20/20.....needed less cooking time I think cause I'd browned them so well. Turned out wonderful!","I intended to submit this review two weeks ago & since then, my husband has requested this dish three more times. I did change a couple things. I baked for 35 minutes and warmed the sauce in a pot on the stove rather than pouring it over the chops. I also used cream of chicken rather than mushroom, since we're not mushroom fans and doubled the milk rather than using wine. It turned out fabulous. THANKS so much for this recipe!","This smells great after you take it out of the oven, and the preperation wasn't as long as I thought it would be. I did not bake them for as long as the recipie called b/c I ran out of time. They were done after 35 min and everything tatsted great, very tender and juicy. The sauce textrue was ""just right"", not too watery and not too chunky. One suggestion I have is to make double the sauce if you like to dip the meat because you'll wish you had more after you try it. I substituted the white wine with Vermouth, and next time I am thinking of adding more of the Vermouth or white wine and taking away some of the milk. This I think will strenghthen the taste of the sauce to be even better as the wine/Vermouth seems to play a big part in the taste of the whole meal. A note of caution: be careful not to burn the pork chops when frying, keep the heat at med/high and check often, I ""saved"" them just in time :). A+","Excellent recipe! Past reviewers that complain the dish is soggy possibly don't understand that the breading is INTENDED to soften up. I think the breading is just for a little color and flavor. It was not intended to stay crunchy while being baked in a lot of sauce. Anyway, I served this with mashed potatoes and asparagus and it was delightful. Only things I would clarify are that I used Lawry's brand seasoning salt, Chardonnay for the wine, and I only used 4 pork chops with the same amount of gravy in the recipe. The perfect amount was left to drizzle over the potatoes. Maybe a little more wine could be added next time. Thanks again!!","Breaded pork chops are always a hit with my husband and I've been making pork chops like this for years. I always use Italian style bread crumbs and just eyeball extra seasonings to add like garlic powder, cracked black pepper, dried parsley, Italian seasoning and some grated Parmesan cheese. I always dip my pork chops into the egg/milk mixture then the seasoned bread crumbs and then repeat that procedure (double dipping). This gives the pork a thick breading and keeps it moist while baking. To cut calories and time I spray the bottom of a glass baking dish with Pam, place the breaded pork in (no frying needed) then spray the pork with a little Pam, cook at 350 for 20 minutes, turn and cook for another 25 minutes. They'll come out moist and tender. This recipe has the pork cooking for way too long - it'll dry right out! And, there's nothing worse than dried out pork. I tried the soup mixture over top and well, it was OK. I poured it over half the chops during the last 15 minutes of cooking. I think I'll stick to the breaded pork chops without the soup mixture.....","Man......THESE PORK CHOPS ARE SLAMMING!!! I can't even describe how friggin good and tender they were!!! I followed the recipe, but I did make a few changes........of course. I followed some others' advice and added golden mushroom with the cream of mushroom. That, along with the white wine, is the key to this wonderful tasting dish. I also added some sauteed mushrooms and green onions to the sauce right before I poured it on the chops. Make sure you use a non-stick cooking spray on the bottom of the pan before you start baking so the coat on the pork chops doesn't stick. I served this along with the Angel Chicken Pasta recipe I found on here. It was a very rich meal, but worth every calorie we digested. Put it like this........I have a cousin who can not stand ANY VEGETABLE KNOWN TO MAN. You know what...........he had three servings the first night. That was one of the best compliments I could've gotten. Thank you Dawn for this better than OUTSTANDING RECIPE!!!","I love these folks who alter a recipe and when it comes out a disaster blame the initial recipe! The problem... dear folks is not the recipe...it's YOUR changes. I have used this recipe ""as is"" on several occasions for 20-36 people and I can assure you...IT ROCKS1 Let's be fair...if you alter a recipe accept the results and admit YOU messed up!.","This was great! I too have a fear of making something that tastes like your greasy spoon tasteless meat & canned mushroom soup. So--using someone's idea of boneless chops, I doused the chops with bottled minced garlic, rubbed them with a bit of Kitchen Bouquet, used sour cream instead of milk, used Lindeman's Chardonnay(an inexpensive but but very good Australian wine, threw in about 1 or 2 T sweet Hungarian paprika, & a lot of fresh, sliced, sauteed mushrooms. Did all that make it any better than the original? Don't know, but I do know it got rave reviews. Thanks, Dawn--I've already done this 2x for company, & will do it again till I've run through my list of friends. Jean in Honolulu","I normally don't care for pork chops, but decided to give this a try. It was excellent. I did change a few things though. I used 2 huge butterfly pork chops (instead of 6). I doubled the sauce-used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 2/3rds cup of white wine (I used Chardonnay) and only used 3/4 cup of milk. I sauteed an onion in a tsp of oil first, then added the gravy mix. Heated that up and topped it over the chops. I also cut down the cooking time-45minutes/30minutes. Turned out increadibly tender. My husband had seconds.","I just made this last night and it was delicious! It definitely is not just another blah pork chops w/cr. of mushroom soup recipe. My picky 3 1/2 year old and 18 mth. old ate it up! I used 5 1-inch thick boneless chops - seasoned w/roasted garlic & pepper blend as well as Nature's Seasonings. Baked 45 min. I sauteed some onions and a can of mushrooms (didn't have fresh). We like a lot of sauce so I used a can of cr. of mushroom and a can of cr. of celery. Added 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup Chardonnay, sprinkled a bit of paprika, cayenne and parsley. Baked 25 minutes, then served over rice. Definitely a keeper!",I was NOT impressed with this recipe. The pork was tender but lacked a strong flavor. The steps to prepare it left a lot of dirty dishes too. The cooking time was as other reviewers mentioned off as well. I did 30 min before adding the soup mixture and 30 after.,"OK this is like the 10th time I have made these. The first time I made them they were AWESOME, so tender and juicy they fell off the bone, every other time I made them they didn't turn out tender like they did the 1st time. This is what i learned, DON""T use wicked thick pork chops, I used center pork chops w/bone. I used chops about 1inch thick, Make sure your oil and pan are hot before you add them. brown them well on both sides. I always double the soup, It gives you tons of sauce, but more the better. I also sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms in the pan I fried the pork chops in then i added to the soup. The most important part of this is NOT to use wicked thick pork chops, they wont come out as tender as they should. I made this last night just like i said and again my husband said they were the best pork chops he has had. hope these tips help. this is definetly a keeper. thanks again dawn","There's always a few people out there who are in the minority when it comes to a great recipe and I'm one of them. My husband and I are not pork lovers but I thought I'd give this one a try. I made this with a pork tenderloin and lowfat/low sodium soup. Baked for 20 min. then poured on gravy and baked, loosely covered, for another 20. Meat was very tender but totally lacked flavor. I even added 1 T dried sage to gravy. It didn't help. Also, I did not bother using the olive oil when browning. Perhaps if I had followed the recipe the outcome would've been better. In any event, I won't be making this again.","What a great recipe!!! I used boneless pork tenderloins, doubled the gravy using cream of chicken and mushroom soup, and chicken broth instead of the wine. I decreased the frying time to about 2-3 minutes per side and the baking time to 20 minutes/45 minutes with the soup mixture. (It required less time because the tenderloins were not very thick). I also followed the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled some french onion soup mix into the bread crumbs and all over the top of the dish after covering the pork with the soup mixture. The pork chops were so tender and moist and the gravy was delicious on mashed potatoes, too. The dish was very flavorful due to extra garlic powder and the french onion soup mix. My husband said, ""this is the best pork chop recipe I've EVER had!"" I have never seen him this enthused about any recipe! My extremely picky 9 year old loved it too. I, of course loved it and have included it in my family favorites. I find it very helpful to review the remarks of others for tips on modifying recipes. I'll be making this again soon!",I used apple juice instead of white wine and these were superb!,"Like most cooks, I like recipes that are simple and to the point. If I don't have each and every ingredient in the cupboard, I improvise. This recipe turned out very good, even though I did not have all the required ingredients. I seasoned my pork chops with some garlic pepper after patting them dry, and proceeded to follow the directions to the letter, minus the wine. I have never been a huge pork chop fan, but I had a package of some center cut chops in the freezer, and decided to try a recipe from this site. The pork chops came out quite tender and tasty, and it's true...you won't need a knife to cut the chops. The breading on the chops was very good, and the gravy made from the soup and combined with the porkchop drippings, was excellent. Preparing the chops for the oven was not difficult, and the only ""drawback"" that I can find with making these chops is that it does require some extra cooking time, something we all don't seem to have any more. Make time for these chops. As I said, I did not use each and every ingredient in this recipe, and as far as I'm concerned, the integrity of the meal was not compromised. This is a great way to prepare the meat, and it went fast in my household. I will make this again, and have added it to my recipe box.","This was excellent! My kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds. I love the wine flavor...next time I might pull back on the milk and add a little more wine. Also I agree with others that the time may be a bit off... my chops were boneless and about a 1/2 inch thick. I fried on high heat until crispy (prob only 2 mins on ea side not 5 as the recipe states). Then I baked them for 30mins w/o sauce and then 30mins with sauce. They were just perfect for us...tender, moist, and definitely not over cooked.","These were the BEST chops I've had in a long time! Thought it would be kind of bland, but not so at all! One of the things I changed was the cooking time, which I cut back to an hour total. After about 30 minutes of cooking, I added the gravy/sauce to finish off this dish. Otherwise, the pork gets tough and leathery. Also, I added more wine (about 3/4 cup), less milk (1/4 cup), to the soup, and it just POPPED with flavor!!! Make sure to really brown your chops too, so the breading doesn't get mushy. Oh my gosh! My six year old LOVED this! Served over rice makes an excellent meal. I don't agree with others who said this took too much time to make. Well worth the effort! Over a thousand people couldn't be wrong with this one! :)","I made these pork chops for my boyfriend and I last Sunday. We both enjoyed them. I was worried that the breading would turn to mush, but it was fine. I omitted the wine completely and mixed the mushroom soup with a 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead. After I browned the chops in oil and placed them in the oven, I sauteed a vidalia onion and a bunch of fresh sliced mushrooms in broth and minced garlic. Smothered the pork chops with them before covering all with the mushroom soup/broth gravy. Only baked an additional 1/2 hour and they were cooked through and very tender. Served them with rice and green peas. It was delicious!","I didn't get to taste this, as I was out for the evening, however, my gang loved this recipe and told me so the moment I walked in. I used my mandolin and very thinly sliced three potatos which I seasoned with garlic and onion powder, pepper and a little italian seasonings and placed on the bottom of the casserole dish. I doubled the sauce and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and beer in lieu of the wine. After quickly frying the chops, I placed them on top of the potatos and immediately added the sauce and popped them in the oven for about an hour. Cooking time would most likely have been a little less had I preheated the oven sooner. Thanks so much Dawn!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33,Hi - this is Starflower and I submitted this recipe. Just wanted to let you know...you never marinate fish for more than 30 minutes! It is not like meat. Per professional chefs.,"oh my!!! this has got to be one of the yummiest things i've cooked lately! i used organic DARK maple syrup.. natural soy sauce (tamrari) and made it in tin foil.. placed in a glass pie plate... opened during last 5 min or so and broiled it.. also drained off sauce.. reduced it in a small saucepan.. added a tiny bit of cornstarch, whisked it and poured over salmon on warmed dinner plates. Made carrots baked in the oven with a bit of butter and cinnamon and a cranberry wild/brown rice pilaf. :) i'd say this is one my fav meals in a long time.. thank you soooo much. i didnt use garlic salt.. i used 2 cloves of garlic and added a bit of ground sea salt... and freshly ground pepper. :):) sooo good.. will make for company for sure! :)","The recipe was pretty good as is. I would specify that cooking salmon is not as simple as placing in oven for x amount of time. You should cook salmon based on thickness. Bake uncovered in a preheated 450°F oven for 4-6 minutes for each .5 inch of thickness. As others have stated, you shouldn't marinade fish for any longer than 30 minutes. If you want the flavor to really soak in, marinade in tin foil to keep the marinade on the filet. Great recipe idea and some great alternative ideas!!",One of my favorites with this small variation. I bake in foil for 15 minutes and then break open the foil under the broiler for the last 4-5 minutes. This makes for a dryer crisper outer crust that our family likes.,"This is a great recipe with one change. Add fresh ginger... I use about a tablespoon, or a little more/less to taste. I also don't add garlic salt. The soy sauce is enough to add plenty of salty taste and sodium. To marinade this, I just place the glaze in a shallow dish and lay the salmon in it, skin up. This works perfectly. This is FABULOUS","I have made this once. My family REALLY liked it, especially me because it was easy. The only thing I did different was instead of using a shallow baking dish I placed the salmon on foil, poured on the sauce and wrapped it up so that there would be maximum sauce on salmon coverage. I let it sit for 30 minutes as recommended and baked for about 25 to 30 minutes. No leftovers to store, no clean up and great fish...5 stars. Good Luck!","************ Mondo- beyond extra stars!!!! This is the best way to do salmon- EVER! In a restaurant or at home. YUM!!!!!!!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly- and added a tablespoon of horseradish. (I knew it would be too sweet for us- we're spicy people here!) This recipe is awesome and delish! I cooked my salmon for 20 minutes and took the foil off for the last 5, spooned some of the sauce over the top after it came out and it was PHENOMENAL!!!!!!! Rock my socks good! Thanks so much for this recipe! It is great! UPDATE- made this again with thicker cuts of salmon and had to cook longer - maybe 40 mins. The cooking time really seems to vary depending on the thickness of the fish.","I make this recipe exactly as is and I absolutely love it. If I lived on a farm and this recipe was a pig I'd want to keep it as a pet and give it only the finest table scraps. I'd probably name it Oinker, or maybe Oinkr in a pathetic attempt to seem trendy. I would keep trying to give it a collar (that would be so adorable!) but it would always find a way to get the collar off. It would get along famously with the dog. I would post an obscene amount of videos on youtube of the two of them interacting. Its family would still be brutally slaughtered but pigs aren't too bright so I don't think it would care or even notice.","Even though my husband doesn't often enjoy ""sweet"" meat, he likes this one. I purchased frozen salmon and made up the marinade as the salmon was thawing. The changes I made: I don't like to use garlic salt so I decided to omit it. I used light maple syrup so I added a tablespoon of dark brown sugar (which oddly added a nice sweet hint of molasses). I minced up a two small cloves of garlic and added some extra garlic powder on top. I double layered a sheet of aluminum foil and set the mostly thawed pieces of salmon in with the mixture. I folded up the foil into a bag and set everything into a baking dish and turned the bag occationally while the salmon finished defrosting. While in the oven I flipped the bag over twice more and then at the end I opened the bag and broiled the top of the salmon for just about 3 minutes so the sugars could carmelize a little. *My filets were about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches thick so I could beef up the flavor... maybe if yours are thinner you might add a little less, use your judgement.",So easy and great flavor! I omited the garlic salt and marinated overnight. The maple really gives the salmon a nice touch!,"This was an interesting salmon recipe. The maple syrup is very nice for the taste buds, though personally, I'd use a little less syrup. (I used the real deal organic maple syrup, though, so perhaps the taste was a little stronger?) Anyway, the problem I have with this recipe is the contrasting tastes. Although syrup sounds fascinating when pairied with garlic and pepper and soy, the flavors seem at odds and even compete with each other. Especially the garlic. It's just not a pleasant complement, aaccording to my family's preferences. In fact, I'd say the whole recipe competes too much with the natural taste of salmon. So, if you're a traditional fan, and love salmon + lemon/lime/etc, you might want to stick to that. However, if you love sweets and don't mind heavy unusual- tasting dishes, this might be the recipe for you.","I've made this twice. First following the recipe to the T and it was good, but I felt the flavor could be stronger.=== The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe and followed some suggestions posted in the reviews. I marinated it wrapped in tin foil to keep as much of the marinade on the fillet as possible. After 30 minutes, I placed the pouches on a baking sheet and baked them for 20 minutes at 400F. While they were cooking I prepared another baking sheet with tinfoil and lightly greased it with cooking spray. Removed salmon from oven. Very carefully I removed the fillets from the pouches and placed them on the second baking sheet, reserving the liquid. Poured the liquid into a saucepan and added about 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch. Increased the oven temperature to Broil and returned the fillets to the oven for five minutes. Meanwhile, cooked the remaining liquid over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes to thicken sauce. Served over fillets. DELICIOUS!!! My boyfriend and his brother both LOVED this recipe.","I catch about 40-50 salmon a year so it is a staple food in the house. I made this recipe exactly as written, added a bit of cayenne because we like the heat. This is fantastic and simple! Most People overcook fish. I cooked for 13 mins at 360 and took the fillets out slightyly pink. By the time they are served they are PERFECT.. Remove fish from oven when slightly pink..Thanks for a great recipe!","Delicious!! Make sure you put some of the left over glaze on the fish when you serve it, it's very good. I will defnitley make this again...not to sweet, just perfect!",I've been forced to host dinner parties just because of this maranide.,This is an excellent recipe. I took the advice of one reviewer and added ginger. I also omitted the garlic salt. I will definitely make this again.,"Very tasty without overpowering the taste of the salmon. I had 1-1/2 lbs. of salmon and there was plenty of marinade. I baked for 20 mins., then turned the oven off and let it bake for another 10 mins. I did not have any problem with the marinade burning or drying up. I brushed the sauce on the salmon a couple times during the baking process. Great recipe, starflower! **Note to melodysmall: You have to use real maple syrup. Mrs. Butterworth, and similar brands, are just corn syrup with flavoring. The consistency isn't the same at all. Once you start using real maple syrup, you won't want to go back. Try a medium or light amber.",This is a decent base recipe but FRESH GRATED GINGER IS A MUST to make this recipe a real winner; before I added it the dish was unremarkable. Ginger root keeps very well in the freezer. Grate ginger over the top to your desired taste. YUM!,"Extraordinarily tasty--and beautiful to see! I did this for guests and had rave reviews. I followed several of the reviewer suggestions and it worked very well: I used REAL maple syrup, added about 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, baked the salmon in a foil-lined pan for about 15 minutes, and then broiled it for 5 minutes. It was tender and juicy with a gorgeous glazed look on top, and was very easy to clean up.",The sauce is very sweet but goes along with the salmon great. Very similar to a salmon recipe you would get at a nice chinese restaurant. It has an oriental undertone because of the soy sauce. I made this with a side dish of couscous.,Used brown sugar in place of maple syrup (it's what I had on hand) and my entire family loved this recipe!,We make salmon all the time and this is an excellent recipe! We doubled the garlic and added 2 tsp. horseradish like another reviewer. The maple really gives this dish a unique flavor. We served with Pecan Wild Rice and spinach salad. great dinner.,"I've made a recipe similar for years; it's a big hit esp. with my kids. I use FAR more garlic usually - I run 5-10 large cloves through the garlic press, until the glaze is almost a paste. Sometimes use a Tbsp. of fresh grated ginger as well. I've done this in the oven, under broiler, and on the grill with great results each time.",Yummy & Easy!! My husband loved this salmon - and it's one of many that I've made him. The preparation is simple and fast. The cooking time is quick and the result is delicious. Big thumbs up!!,"Excellent marinade. What I like about this is that the sauce itself is not strong or overpowering in any way. It is a nice subtle sweet maple flavor and works real well with the salmon. The prep, ingredients, directions and baking time were all spot on! I did place the salmon in an aluminum foil, along with the marinade, 30 minutes prior to cooking. The salmon baked up, uncovered, at 400 degrees in 20 minutes. The salmon flaked easily with a fork. The marinade smelled very nice. The maple sauce was delicately sweet and I like the hint of soy sauce and garlic in the marinade. The salmon was tender, flavorful and melted in my mouth...Mmm. I am glad that this dish turned out real well. Mahalo STARFLOWER for sharing your recipe.",Delicious!!! I used 5 garlic cloves finely minced and a few drops of lemon juice to make it zestier. I double the recipe. Wowwww this was a real success at home and my husband ate it at first as a favor to me and later wanted to eat more and more.,"I have not tried this yet, but came across the recipe while looking for salmon with a maple pecan glaze. Has anyone tried adding toasted pecans pieces to this recipe? Seems like it would work.",,,,,,,,,
34,"I have one thing that I do every time I cook salmon. I always make a little foil packet for each fillet and close it up, leaving a little room for air to circulate inside. If you bake the foil packets on a cookie sheet at 425 for about 15 minutes (slightly longer depending on number of fillets), the salmon cooks to perfection every time! This is a great recipe to use when preparing salmon in foil packets... it poaches gently in its on juices and always comes out so tender and delicious!",My husband really liked this one. I used 1/3 c. lemon juice and 1/4 tsp. black pepper instead of the lemon pepper. I cut the soy sauce to 1/4 c. to lesson the salt flavor and used only 1 T. olive oil to cut calories. I also sprayed the grill plate with olive oil to keep the salmon from sticking. Turned out wonderfully.,"FANTASTIC! We live in Alaska, and have lots of salmon to eat. We are always looking for the next great Salmon Recipe. This one is now our favorite. Try it, you WILL like it. My only suggestion is to grill the fish, flesh side down first (facing the hot coals). This allows the brown sugar to glaze the fish and seal in the moisture. Then after about 7 minutes, flip the fish over with the skin side down facing the hot coals. Don't worry about sticking to the grill, the oil in the recipe help to make this not a problem. Enjoy....Thanks for the recipe!","Excellent recipe. Be sure to use plain Lemon Pepper and not Lemon Pepper Seasoning Salt (you will oversalt if you do). If grilling is rained out, this can be baked in a 450 degree oven for 12 minutes, and then broiled for 5 minutes. The soy sauce and brown sugar blend wonderfully with the salmon flavor.","YUM! This is one of the best marinades I have tasted for salmon! I'd rather stay home and make this than pay for salmon at a restaurant with this recipe! The longer you marinate it - the better. I tried grilling this on a bbq - and it came out very good but didn't hold the seasoning in well (even though I wrapped it in foil). The second time, I wrapped it in foil again and broiled it in the oven - and the marinade really stuck. I use both the lemon pepper seasoning AND fresh lemon juice. I will make this recipe over and over again - especially since I live in the great Northwest where salmon is abundant. I think this would taste good with other types of fish also.","This is now a staple in our low-fat home. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and it worked beautifully. Also, leftovers can be sauteed in a little olive oil and fresh lemon juice, and it's even better the second time around!! Try the Dill Sauce recipe with it - Yum!!","This is my FAVORITE marinade for salmon! My whole family raves over it and it is SO easy! One tip - I grill the fish with the skin down first to capture the juices, when I flip it over the skin just peels off! Even people that don't like fish - love this recipe!","Must agree. I have used this recipe for years and have a tip for the grillers. Place the salmon side, skin side down, on aluminun foil. Grill for 8 minutes on medium heat. When it's time to turn, grab a long edge of the foil, sliding it off the fire and flip the fish gently onto the hot part of the grill. Gently remove the foil, and, viola, the skin comes right off. Brush on some more marinade at this point. Cover the grill and cook 7 more minutes. Mmmmmmm....","I made a variation. I used honey crystals rather than brown sugar (that's what I had on hand). In addition, I sprinkled the salt and lemon pepper seasoning on the fish. Finally, I cooked it in a hot skillet on top of the stove with the remainder of the marinade from the bag plus a little water. By the time the marinade had reduced the fish was tender and flaky and among the tastiest dishes I have ever made. A very forgiving recipe that really tastes great.",My 4-year old begs me to make this! I followed the advice of another reviewer and usually bake this in a 450 degree oven for 12 minutes and broil for 5 minutes. I also transfer the marinade to a saucepan to make a yummy gravy by adding 1 T. of corn starch and bringing to a boil. Serve with rice for an absolutely super meal!,LOVE IT!! Yummmmmyyyy.....VERY good recipe! The whole family loved it (including a VERY picky husband). My kids loved it! The only substitution I made was extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable and I baked it in the oven at 450 for 12 mins and then broiled for 5 mins. (It was TOO cold to go out and BBQ). This one is a keeper and I have already shared this recipe with several of my friends. Thanks:),Very good salmon. I love salmon and the flavor of the marinade was great!,this is a very good recipe. definitely save the marinade and cook it separately. add some cornstarch to thicken it and pour it over the salmon as a gravy. the flavor is a little light just the way it is right now. the gravy would make it perfect. serve it with rice and have the rice soak up that sweet and savory salmon gravy. very yummy. you also if you dont have time just bake the salmon plain then use the marinade to make a gravy to pour over the salmon. still works,"This was great. I skinned the salmon before marinating it overnight, used lemon juice and pepper (instead of lemon pepper), light soy sauce, and olive oil (instead of vegetable oil). Cooked them in foil packets at 425 for 12 minutes, served with steamed green beans, sauteed, herbed red potatoes, and sauvignon blanc. Delicious!","My husband said this was better than any salmon he has ever had! I only marinated for about an hour and it still turned out good. I have a basket to put on the grill so it is easy to flip the fish over without it sticking. I put all the seasonings in with the liquids too, and it turned out great!",Excellent! Summer lunch supreme....,"I used ¼ cup of pure maple syrup in lieu of the brown sugar. My choice of soy sauce was ""low sodium"". Added a dash of cayenne pepper (ground chili) to up its tanginess index and rubbed the fish down with all the ingredients incl. the oil. Skipped the lemon pepper and the salt. Baked in an open, lightly oiled Pyrex dish at 450ºF (10 min. per inch of thickness). Even without marinating this is a superb dish, a keeper; thanks!","My husband loved this, but I found it far too sweet. If I make this again I'll add lots of ginger and maybe some sriracha to balance the sweetness.","I used a frozen fillet of salmon and baked it in foil. I sprinkled brown sugar, garlic powder, lemon pepper and salt on the bottom and then put the fillet down. I pushed the sides of the foil up and sprinkled the seasonings on again and then mixed the soy sauce, water & olive oil and poured it on top and sealed it in. I cooked it on a baking sheet in the foil at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. It was moist and delicious!!!","I've made this salmon twice, never altering the recipe and both times it was FANTASTIC! I did follow the recommendation of another reviewer and grilled it fleshside down first (skin up) and this creates a nice carmalization of the marinade. When done the meat slid right off the skin. The first time I made this, I only marinated it for the minimum of two hours, and it was really good. The second time I marinated the salmon all day and it was even better! A must add to the salmon recipes!",This is the best way I have learned to cook salmon. My gf that wasn't sure if she ever likes salmon loves this recipe!,"I have made this salmon recipe - exactly as written here - for family (both immediate and extended) and for friends... dozens of times over the past several years. I will never... I repeat NEVER... make salmon with any other recipe other than this one. So simple, yet so delicious. My two sons ask me to make it for them all the time; I would, except buying quality salmon isn't inexpensive. I have found that our local Costco has some of the freshest salmon available here in the desert southwest... plus, I like that their salmon comes skinless. (Just a matter of taste, but I'm not a big fan of skin on fish of any kind.). UPDATE: 11/1/14: In my opinion, this Is THE best recipe on AR!",Absolutely fabulous! The taste was great even when in a hurry when I couldn't let the salmon marinate for the complete time alloted in the recipe! Excellent meal!,"WoW! You will love this recipe. I have been using this for years and everyone I serve it to just raves! I substitute a lemon garlic spice blend for the lemon pepper and I throw in a generous amount of minced garlic as well. We liked the recipe as submitted, but we all love garlic, so we decided to make the change. You will not regret trying this recipe!","This marinade was absolutely delicious! I actually baked 6 oz. salmon filets, so I made some modifications. Added a couple splashes of lemon juice to the mixture, instead of seasoning the filets directly with lemon pepper. I also used jarred minced garlic to taste. Let the filets marinate for two hours, then wrapped them along with the all of the juice in tin foil and baked on 375 for 35 minutes. Outstanding!!!","Excellent salmon recipe! I was a little worried after I made the marinade and tasted a little. But I thought, ""hey, 823 people can't be wrong"". Two hours and 15 minutes later I found out they weren't. Everything plays together really nicely, and it was a definite hit at my house. I took the advice of others who don't have grills, and 425 for 15 in a foil packet was perfect.",,,,,,,,,,
35,"Here's the deal folks! Most would agree that using a pork tenderloin for pulled pork is not a good idea. Cheaper cuts of pork work just the same and have tons of flavor! I used a 4 pound shoulder cut (also called Boston butt). It was only $5, whereas a 2 pound cut of tenderloin was $10! I cooked in the slow cooker for 7 hours, pulled it apart and mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's Hot and Spicy sauce, and then cooked for another hour. I served them on Kaiser rolls with coleslaw and homemade fries from this site. Amazing!!","This was so easy to make and the results were amazing. I followed the recipe only adding a couple of things. Before placing the tenderloin in the slow cooker, I rubber salt, pepper, and garlic salt on it. I then used a fork to poke holes in the tenderloin so the juices could be soaked up. I added the root beer and let it cook on low for 5 1/2-6 hours. I then drained and pulled the pork apart easily with a fork. I returned the pork to the slow cooker and added the BBQ sauce and let it continue to cook on low for another 1-1 1/2 hours. It was so good and and my husband loved it.","I was looking for something I could cook in the crock pot on a very busy day. I was tired of the usual pot roast, and we have chicken all the time so,the idea of pulled pork occured to me. I tweaked this reciped just a bit and the result was really good! I knew a 2 lb tenderloin would never be enough for my family of 6, so on the advice of the butcher at my grocery store, I used a 4 lb shoulder (it had a small bone in it, but it slid out easily after cooking on low for 10 hours. I mixed 1/2 cup of Bull's Eye Original Barbeque sauce with 2 cups of root beer then poured it over the roast, sprinkled it with a generous amount of dried minced onion, then drizzled some additional barbeque sauce over the roast. Halfway through cooking, I turned the roast over, added more minced onions and another drizzle of sauce. After 10 hours in the crock, I removed the roast, let cool slightly and then shredded it. I mixed in the rest of the barbeque sauce, some salt and a little water to moisten it and served it on a bun. The result was a restuarant quality pulled pork sandwich that my whole family enjoyed! I will definitely be making this again!","WOW!! This is SO GOOD! I have to admit, when my friend first told me about ""Root Beer"" pork, I was skeptical. Then she told me that her chef fiance loved it, so I decided that was a good reason to give it a try. I'm SO glad I did! I cooked it in just root beer for 6 hours, then drained it and cooked it in the BBQ sauce for an hour. When I tasted it, it MELTED in my mouth! It is SO GOOD!!! Plus it was super easy! Highly recommended!!","FANTASTIC! I had gone to ""Log Cabin BBQ"" the last night, which inspired me to try to make pulled pork sandwiches myself. This one blows Log Cabin BBQ out of the water! I used a 6 pound pork shoulder and filled up my slow cooker with root beer to cover the meat. Left it in for about 10 hours. It was so tender and juicy, I could barely take it out of the slow cooker! The best thing is--7 pounds of pork shoulder was only about $10!!!! The means you can make enough pulled pork sandwiches to feed about 30 people for about $15-20!! And they will be raving about it! Extra points for ease, too!","Thought this was good, but not too much different than what I usually make. I typically use pork butt or shoulder and cook it with a cup of water, shredding and adding the bbq sauce at the end. I like the idea in this recipe of using pork tenderloin - it's a lot less fatty and very easy to shred/pull, although you may sacrifice some flavor using a leaner cut like this. As for the rootbeer - it didn't seem to noticeably enhance the flavor of this dish for me. In all fairness though, I did have a cold, so maybe that had something to do with it! The rootbeer did however make for a messy crockpot when it came to clean up as the sugar caramelized on the side of the pot and was really tough to scrub off. I'd recommend either using cooking spray on the sides of the crockpot, or trying a pan liner made for crockpots. If like me you have trouble getting it clean - try scrubbing with your fingers using a paste made from Bon Ami. Worked for me!","I appreciate folks who review the recipe when they have used the original ingredients. What I don't appreciate, is someone who posts and completely changed ingredients. Why not post as an entirely different recipe. This was great as is. It will vary, depending on what barbecue sauce you use.","This is a GREAT recipe for a sweet southern type pork unlike the strong underlying flavor of vinegar favored by the East coast or the mustard based sauces of South Carolina/ Georgia. With that being said if you are a traditionalist of a geographic region, this is probably NOT the recipe for you unless you like the sweeter sauces of Tennessee. Experience imparts using a pork tenderloin will provide a drier meat, however using something will a little more fat such as a shoulder or butt will impart more flavor. The main tip for this recipe is to ensure your meat is covered with liquid, or turn it every few hours. Mixed with Sweet Baby Rays, Sweet and Spicy sauce to help counter the sweetness of the root beer and cooked for 1 hour longer to absorb the sauce into the meat. Served on onion rolls with a sprinkling of French's French Fried Onion Rings on the meat and a side of apple coleslaw (from this site) for a quick dinner. 5 stars for a truly easy, no fuss, no muss recipe.",Very very good. I used a pork shoulder roast. I soaked it in the rootbeer overnight. We love Sweet Baby Rays Brown Sugar and Hickory sauce. I couldn't keep the kids from eating it before dinner. I will be making this again for sure. Would be great to serve to a crowd.,I thought this was a great recipe! I used a bottle of beer instead of the rootbeer.,"Rootbeer?!? Seriously?!? That was my first response - I too went for the boston butt over the tenderloin - 4lbs for 1/2 the price of a 2lb tenderloin was enticing and, yes, I was skeptical - I jabbed the chunk of pork a few times with a fork left all the fat on it, tossed it in my big crockpot and covered it with a 2L bottle of 99c A&W Rootbeer (total cost, about $9.50) - set it on low for 7 hours and went to work... Came home for lunch, rolled the meat at 4 hours and went back to work... came home, and found the CP on ""keep warm"" - I dumped the liquid fat and rootbeer, pulled the bone, forked the meat apart and dumped a 23oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce into the pot and set it back to low for 1hr - the result was about 3.5 lbs of the best pulled pork my family has tasted - this could have served 10 people but there is less than half left!!! I saw this recipe pop in a ""Superbowl Main Course"" survey today (after I made it) - Shoot yeah, this is Superbowl food!!! I sampled the pork after the rootbeer bath and it already was great - I loved the raw sweetness the RB provided to the exterior and it was super tender and moist.... Winner Winner, Pork dinner....",This was a big hit. Very easy to make. The family loved it and I will be making this for a party. Thanks for the great recipe.,"I love this recipe, however, I have found that it is much easier to cook on low for 10 hours and turn the slow cooker on before I go to bed the night BEFORE we want it. The next morning, I take a fork and everything falls a part on its own. I add more BBQ sauce, stir and place the crock pot in the fridge and off to work I go. When I get home, I pull the crock pot out, turn it back on high for 2 hours and serve....Letting it sit all day allows for the sauce to soak up into the pork.","Very tasty - easy recipe. I marinated the pork loin in a wet rub made with dry onion soup mix with fresh garlic, Montreal steak spice, pepper and worcesteshire sauce. I served the pulled pork on whole wheat buns with coleslaw. Chances are, I'll make this one again.","This was definitely a great recipe, but I have to give it only 4 stars. Using pork tenderloin for pulled pork is like using beef tenderloin for meatloaf - the basic idea is right but overkill. Pork shoulder roast or a picnic cut is better. Really any cheaper cut of higher fat pork will work better than tenderloin. All that being said, the tenderloin does work and provides a low fat, but more dry pulled pork. I've also used Dr. Pepper, added sliced sweet onion, 1/4 c. apple cider vinegar and 1 t. red pepper flakes. Adds a little zing to the sweet. It's been my experience that the pork comes out better cooked on LO for the entire time. If you have to shorten your cooking time and use HI, be sure that all of the meat is covered with liquid and place the onion under the pork to avoid burning or overcooking.","I recently got back from Memphis, TN on a business trip. After going to ""The B-B-Q Shop"" and having a great pulled pork sandwich, I decided that I'd make some pulled pork and see how it compared. I started off with a 2.5 pound pork tenderloin which I trimmed only a little of the surface fat from. I then poked holes on it and cut it into four pieces to better lay in my 6 quart cooker. I seasoned it with fresh ground pepper on all sides, kosher salt, and some garlic powder. I topped with some crushed red pepper flakes and let it stand for about 10 minutes. I chopped up a red onion and took only three center discs and laid them on the bottom of my cooker. I put the meat on top and poured in two cans of A&W Rootbeer. I cooked the pork on low for a little over six hours, and when I could hardly get it out of the cooker it was so tender. Two forks made quick work of the meat. I cleaned the cooker and put the meat back in with Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce. I cook it for another hour on low, mixing it a couple of times during cooking. I buttered sandwich rolls, with a sprinkle of onion powder, then toasted them. Once they came out I put a fresh slice of pepper jack cheese and then loaded them up with pork. For topping I had the original sauce and the sweet and spicy variation. These were AWESOME. Very simple recipe, great results. I think the seasoning does help as I don't like plain food. I'm stuffed, can't wait for left overs!","Hint for removing stuck-on foods from crockpot--put a fabric softenr sheet in the empty crockpot, fill with HOT WATER and let it sit for an hour or two. Works for me every time! GREAT RECIPE--use boston butt instead of tenderloin..","Very basic, so I used this as ""inspiration"". As others said, use a pork shoulder roast rather than tenderloin - it's much cheaper. I also seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and seared the roast before putting it in the slow cooker, covered it with root beer, added a bit of hot chipotle BBQ sauce and a dried piri-piri pepper. Do NOT throw out the liquid when the roast is cooked! That stuff holds so much flavour, it's a shame to waste it. Instead, ladle it out into a pot and reduce it to a thick sauce, adjust flavour as needed, and pour as much back onto the shredded meat as you like - less for a dryer pulled pork, more for saucier. Sweet, spicy, and full of pork flavour!","I didn't have 8 hours, so I cooked a 3 lb shoulder roast in the oven, covered, with 2 cups Rootbeer, and cooked it at 350 for 4 hrs. The entire roast was INFUSED with rootbeer (adding a wonderful sweetness, almost candied flavor to it). I then decided to make my ROOTBEER BBQ SAUCE with it! It's soooo good and if you are looking to serve a new flavor of pulled pork sandwich, TRY IT! COMBINE ALL INTO SAUCEPOT & SIMMER FOR 20+ MINUTES.*I sometimes have to add cornstarch/water to thicken this, as it's originally for BBQ Ribs* •1 cup root beer •1 cup ketchup •1/2 cup orange juice •3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce •2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice •2 tablespoons brown sugar •1 tablespoon honey •1 clove garlic, minced •1/2 teaspoon lemon zest •1/2 teaspoon onion powder •1/2 teaspoon ground ginger •1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper •salt",This came out so delcious. I used Coca Cola instead of Root beer since that is all I had. My hubby thought it was as good as a BBQ restaurants!,I thought this recipe was easy and great! I did the following modifications to spice it up a little: 1) I used a pork shoulder based on the suggestion of other reviewers 2) The night before cooking I washed my pork shoulder in cold water and poked several holes in it with a fork. I then rubbed 1 package of McCormick® Slow Cookers BBQ Pulled Pork Seasoning on it and wrapped it in saran wrap and put it in the refrigerator overnight. 3) Before putting the pork shoulder in the crockpot the following morning I quartered an onion and used it to line the bottom of the crock pot. 4) I smeared a little bbq sauce on the pork shoulder and then placed it on top of the onions and used an entire 2 litter of rootbeer to cover my pork (I have an oval crock pot so it took a lot). I read in several reviews that stated covering the pork with rootbeer was important. 5) I cooked the pork on low for 8 hours (flipping it 2 -3 times while cooking). 6) After the pork was was cooked I completely emptied the crockpot and let the pork rest under a foil tent for 30 minutes. 7) I then shredded the pork and tossed it in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and placed it back in the crockpot on low for another hour. The result was fabulous pulled pork!!!! I did not think it tasted or smelled like rootbeer (the thought/ smell of rootbeer makes me sick so I was very worried to say the least!). I would highly recommend this recipe and will definitely make it again!,"I made this for our Super Bowl Party and it came out amazing! I admit I was a little skeptical about using the root beer...but boy was I wrong! I used pork butt, per the advice of my butcher and couldn't have been happier with results. I put the meat in the slow cooker and poured the root beer over (using about 1 liter) and left it to cook on low overnight. When I woke up in the morning, I took the pork out and shredded it. Although not much effort was required, since it was pretty much falling apart! What was great about the pork butt was that there was barely any fat at all! I drained the root beer from the slow cooker and returned the shredded meat, added barbeque sauce that I had made, and cooked on low for another 4 hrs or so. The meat was amazing...so tender and flavorful. Served on kaiser rolls with homemade coleslaw on the side. Everyone at the party loved it. This recipe is definitely a keeper! My husband is already asking when I will be making it again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

40,"This turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Here are the changes I made to what is now my favorite dish. In the gravy, I used a can of French Onion soup as well as a can of Cream of Mushroom and a packet of Dry Onion Soup. I omitted the salt due to the high sodium content in the soups. I'm glad I did. I doubled the gravy except for the ketchup...kept it at 1/4 cup while doubling the rest. I also added a jar of mushrooms to the gravy. After browning each side of the patties (and yes, having them fall apart slightly), I transferred the patties to a foil-lined casserole dish, put the gravy on top, covered the dish, and cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes. I was worried the patties wouldn't get all the way done because they were pretty thick, but they turned out perfect!!! We had it with brown rice (and had just enough wonderful gravy to go along with it!) and steamed broccoli. This is a new favorite recipe for my husband and me.","The ""steaks"" themselves were tasty (heavily altered with additional seasonings). My steaks held their shape quite well. I cooked 1/2 batch on the stove and another batch in the oven... preferred the taste of the stove cooked batch, but the oven cooked batch tasted good too. The great disappointment with this recipe was the sauce - it was horrible, to put it kindly! I followed the advice of others to drastically cut the ketchup - but it didn't do much for the flavor. It was far from authentic tasting. I had extra patties and no sauce (not that I would have used the sauce anyway) - the next day I decided to try using Liptons Mushroom and Onion soup mix for the gravy. I followed the package instructions for making gravy... DELICIOUS! It was hands down the best tasting sauce for salisbury steak and so simple to make. So, if you're craving an old cafeteria food favorite - don't waste your time with the recipe for the sauce - buy a box of Lipton Mushroom Onion soup mix and make the gravy with it - you won't regret it!",Great and simple recipe as is. Thanks for a new addition to our home cooked meals. *** Note: I just wanted to add that when people completely change a recipe and then rate it low it is somewhat moronic. You are not rating the recipe we are looking at you are rating your own recipe. It really is not the nicest or the most helpful thing to do (IMHO).,"The only reason I gave this recipe four stars is because I ended up doing a lot of tweaking based on other recommendations. I ended up with a WONDERFUL meal. I took the following suggestions: I added chopped onion and garlic to meat mixture before browning. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to French onion soup, and mixed in a small amount of brown gravy mix to give it some color and thickened it up a bit. I omitted the ketchup and doubled the amount to pour on top of garlic mashed potatoes. For those who had trouble keeping the patties together, try this as was suggested before. Instead of cooking in a skillet, place browned patties in a foil-lined casserole dish, pour gravy over top, and bake at 400 for 30 mins. Your patties will stay together nicely!!","The best salisbury steak ever!! The sauce is great...I browned the steaks in a fry pan and then cooked them in the oven with the sauce poured over them for 30 min. at 325 degrees, covered...they were soooo tender and juicy. Family loved it....will make again very soon.",i have made this recipe now every week...my husband and kids love this...i use onion soup mix and 2cups of water instead...so i dont add any more water to the sauce..i also add onions to the beef and alittle more bread crumbs...thank you i will keep on cooking this...m,"I made the recipe as is and it was really very good. I would never attempt to rate a recipe that I had made ANY changes to as I would not be giving a fair assessment of the recipe as written. It would be like rating my own recipe. I think everyone who posts a recipe has a right to hear what people think of their recipes, as written. Once you tweak it, it's yours. I liked this just fine. When I make it again, I may alter a few things, but no one here will know about it.","I made this recipe a couple of times ""as is"" - Will give 3 1/2 ***. Did not like the ketchup and not enough gravy. After a few modifications... FIVE STARS *****! Here are the modifications I make each time now (thanks to a compilation of others' suggestions on this site): 1.) Chop up one medium onion (fine) and mix it with the hamburger 2.) I used 3 TBL Crisco to brown the steaks in the pan (and then drained before I added the gravy 2.) Double the gravy ingredients and omit the ketchup completely 3.) Add 1 can Mushroom Soup, 1 Pkg. Lipton's Dry Onion Soup Mix and 1/2 Cup brown gravy (I use Campbell's most of the time, but any brand works fine). I prepare the steaks on the stove (don't use the oven as some have suggested), and they turn out perfectly. Serve with mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and Romaine Salad (with dried cherries or cranberries). Yummy!","This is, by far, my favorite salisbury steak recipe. I try to double the gravy because it's so good and just doesn't seem to make enough otherwise.",This was very good and so easy! I only made two changes: I used Onion Soup Mix in 1 1/2 cups water with a boullion cube and used brown gravy instead of ketchup (a family preference). Served them with garlic mashed potatoes - it was great!,I have this exact same recipe at home and this has been one of my family's favorite recipes for years. Over time I have changed the original recipe though; I double the ingredients for the sauce because I felt there wasn’t enough to drizzle over the hamburger when it was done. Just my preference. The original recipe said to put the hamburger over egg noodles but I make garlic mashed potatoes and corn. YUM,"This recipe is great as is. If you insist on making changes to it, instead of berating this recipe why not submit your own recipe?","Very good for something quick and easy to make with ground beef. I added garlic powder to the meat mixture and fried the patties in bacon fat for added flavor. I doubled the amount of gravy, substituted red wine for the water, and added 8 ounces of sauteed mushrooms. This is great comfort food!",This has become a regular in our home. The patties are tender and flavorful and we enjoy the sauce. You can always reduce the amount of ketchup for a less tomato-like taste.,"A nice rendition of a true American classic usually found in Mom and Pop Diners all over America. Easy on the pocketbook and a quick recipe to make for busy nights. Didn't have a can of condensed onion soup, so I subbed a packet of Lipton's Onion Soup. Threw in sauteed mushrooms I had in the fridge which gave more flavor to the dish. The simplicity of this recipe makes it one that will be reached for from time to time. Comfort food at it's best! Thanks for the submission Kelly.","These were great with a few changes. I used closer to 2 ½ lbs of ground beef. Added almost a half a can of the French onion soup. Still added one egg, used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain, more than a ½ a cup just enough to get my meat from being to watery. I added no salt to this and ½ teaspoon of pepper. I put this meat mixture in a container and in the fridge for an hour. I think this helped to combine the flavors. Then I shaped these into elongated patties about a half an inch thick or more. Then I put 2 tablespoons of butter into a pan on medium heat and brown the patties. My patties did not fall apart. I took out the patties and whisked in almost a ¼ cup of flour to the butter. This helped me get a thick sauce then added one and a half a can of French onion soup. You don’t need to add the other whole can of French onion soup but this makes lots of gravy for mashed potatoes. I added 1 squirt of mustard ¼ cup of Worcestershire sauce and 2 squirts of ketchup and half a cup of water or so. I let this boil for 2-3 minutes to thicken up then add my patties into the sauce and lower the heat to medium low for about 15-20 minutes covered. I don’t measure anything or time anything but I’ve made this several times and it comes out wonderful. The meat comes out very moist I will make meatballs next as an appetizer or even a meatloaf would excellent. My boyfriend and his family love it and there are never leftovers. Hope this helps.",Loved this! My whole family ate this and liked it- and I have a child who doesn't like meat and another who doesn't eat very much of anything...both kids and hubby loved this :) It's a keeper in my house!,"Excellent recipe to work from, even my picky son loved this. I browned the steaks in a pan then put them in the crock pot. I poured off most of the grease from the pan, sprinkled a tablespoon or so of flour and cooked it for one minute. Stirred in one can of french onion soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of beef broth and a package of Lipton onion soup mix. Added a few shakes of Worcester and cooked until hot. Poured this over the steaks in the crock pot and cooked for 3 hours on low. The meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender, the gravy flavorful and plentiful enough to serve over mashed potatoes. Topped the steaks off with mushrooms sauteed in butter and garlic. I was afraid the gravy would be way too salty even though I added NO additional salt, but it wasn't. I'm not a person who salts her food and I found it just right.",I followed the recipe and changed very little -- just made extra gravy and used the idea of Progresso Onion soup. It was fantastic! I hope everyone keeps reviewing recipes and gives alternative ideas.,"If you are having trouble with the patties falling apart, form them and then put in the fridge until firm. Also to make more sauce (gravy) to serve over mashed potatoes or noodles, dissolve 1 or 2 beef bouillon cubes in a cup of hot water to add to the dish. Thicken with some corn starch to desired consistency and adjust seasonings accordingly.",Comfort food at its best! I've made this a few times and its simple and good. Its easy to reheat the leftovers too.,"This recipe is wonderful exactly as written. It is just like the way I do meatloaf, so that is why I like it. Making more gravy is easy. Just change the number of servings to a higher amount and follow the recipe for the gravy as written.","When I told my husband what we were having for dinner last night he was less than thrilled, until he tasted it that is. His response was ""this is GREAT."" As I almost always do I changed the recipe to fit our family. I made the ""steaks"" almost exactly as listed except I omited the salt. Too much sodium in the soup. I also added garlic powder and onion powder. I pan fried just to sear them and then moved to the oven. For the sauce I sauteed mushrooms and onions. I then mixed the remaining soup, double the flour, 1/2 package of McCormick au jus mix, 1 can of water and garlic powder. I reduced the ketchup to 1 tsp and the worchestershire sauce to two drops. I stirred until thicken and poured over the steaks in the oven. Baked about 30 minutes and I agree with my husband they were great. Thanks for the recipe.","I made several changes to this recipe due to the comments of others. The recipe really turned out great. My brother, the very picky person he is said this is by far the best Salisbury Steak he has ever had. I put 2 Tbsp of the canned French Onion soup into the meat mixture and used 3/4 cup of fresh bread crumbs instead of dry. I also put 1/2 pkg Lipton Onion Soup mix and a teaspoon of Worcestershire directly into the meat along with 1/4 tsp of dry mustard. Used the rest of the ingredients for the meat mixture as in the recipe omitting the salt. For the gravy after browning, used the rest of the canned soup, only 1 Tbsp of ketchup, 1 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1/4 cup water, 1 beef bouillon cube (Knorr), and 1 small can mushrooms. I used cornstarch for thickening instead of flour. It didn't take much. This is an excellent basic recipe!","Followed the recipe as called for. The steak was absolutely delicious and tender. The sauce...not so much. I am glad that I tasted the sauce before adding it to the pan or I would have been upset. The sauce tastes like a meatloaf topping that I make. I just didn't care for it at all. Thank goodness I had a pack of brown gravy mix and a jar of beef gravy in order to rescue the meal. I will make this again without the sauce the recipe calls for. On a side note, as I prepared the recipe for 8 servings, I browned all steaks in the skillet. Before adding the gravies, I put half of the steaks in a casserole dish. Poured the gravy over the steaks. The steaks cooked in the oven were baked for 25 minutes at 350* and the remaining steaks were cooked on the stove top as directed. The stove top steaks had the better flavor while the oven steaks had a more appealing look to them.","The patties themselves were delicious, but the gravy needed some work! Next time, I will modify the recipe a bit.",very very good fed 6 and only had 1 1/2 lb hamberger it was so good everyone was upset that there were not more.. its so so good,"In some ways, I almost feel the single star rating is unfair. But this is a recipe in which one half is adequate, and the other I just didn't care for at all. As has been mentioned before, the steaks themselves turn out quite well. I made my own onion soup from scratch, as I do not use many canned foods. And the burgers were fantastic! The sauce however was too salty, and the ketchup flavour was too surreal and artificial. A simple red wine and onion gravy would have been much better, and later was in a second attempt. But I would not recommend the sauce.","This came out very tender and quite flavorful. It was fast, and the adults liked it, but the site of all of those onions turned the kids right off. I would make this again, but I would substitute a rehydrated package of dry onion soup mix. (In one cup water.) That way, I can add the onions to the meat mix, and leave them out of the gravy without losing flavor. Also, I would decrease the ketchup to 1/4 c. or so (too much tomato smell, kids thought it was meatloaf!) and add some beef broth or boullion.",,,,,,,

44,"I read almost all of the 400+ reviews and made modifications based on them. To save everyone else some time, here's what they say to do (and what I did...and it came out great): (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a ""dollup"" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra ""tang"", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving. I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted others and I think it helped. Great slow-cooker recipe. I froze the leftovers (egg noodles and all) in my Seal-a-Meal and then just boiled the bag to reheat. It was great the second time around!","I think i made it through about 900 reviews until i started to get a headache :) I cant stand having to go through dozens of pages of reviews to find the ""5 star "" version of the recipe! I am going to make this short and sweet. The recipe that is posted originally is really only a 1 star meal. After all the adjustments, substitutions, etc .. its 5 star fabulous. I have taken all the suggestions and advice from all the reviews and created this: INGREDIENTS 2 pound cubed beef stew meat or chuck roast 2 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup 3/4 cup chopped onion 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup water (more if needed) 1/4 cup low sodium beef stock (more if needed) 1/3 cup sour cream 2 ounces cream cheese (reduced fat works well) 1/2 pack French onion soup mix Salt and pepper, to taste 3 cloves garlic, minced 8oz. mushrooms, sliced Pat of butter DIRECTIONS 1. In slow cooker, combine meat, mushroom soup, chopped onions, minced garlic, Worcestershire, dry soup mix, pepper, stock and water. 2. Cook on low setting for 5-6 hours. 3. During cooking time, sauté the mushrooms in butter about 4 mins. 4. Put sautéed mushrooms in slow cooker last 30 minutes of cooking time 5. Check sauce if it needs salt or extra pepper. 6. Best served over buttered egg noodles. I think this came out fantastic. But again, its all about personal opinions and tastes. Let me know how this works out for everyone!","This is a WONDERFUL recipe! Make sure you do these 5 things, however: 1. Use ""Condensed Golden Mushroom"" soup. The regular Cream of Mushroom doesn't have the larger pieces of mushrooms. 2. Substitute 1/4 cup beef broth for 1/4 water. 3. Use 4 oz. sour cream instead of cream cheese. 4. Add 1/2 t. pepper for a tiny little (but necessary) kick. 4. Just before adding the sour cream, mix 1 T. corn starch with 2 T. cold water, then add this mixture to stroganoff. This gives it the necessary extra thickness. Then, enjoy this FABULOUSLY delicious and simple to make dish!","This recipe (and the reviewers of it) makes me very angry. If you change a bunch of things (or even one or two critical things) about a recipe IT IS NO LONGER THIS RECIPE!! I should not have to read through 50 reviews to know how to make this recipe at the rating it has received. I made no changes at all. It is awful. It is super concentrated with absolutely no sauce. The meat was all shredded up from cooking so long, and the flavor was FAR too salty. Don't make this recipe. If you've tried it with all the million alterations people have insisted you need to do in order for it to be good, then go ahead and submit that recipe to Allrecipes.com I'll try it -- and maybe it will deserve the nearly 5 stars this recipe has.","Wow! For my husband and I to agree that a dish is worthy of 5 stars is very rare. This was a great comfort food dinner, perfect after a very long day, so easy to make. And I have never made homemade stroganoff before! I made some changes, based on Jillybean14's review, who summed up the 500+ reviews on here (thank you!). To do what Jillybean did, and save others some time, here is what all these reviews say to do: 1)Add some salt,pepper, and garlic to the pot. 2) Double the meat. 3) Double the soup and water but keep worchestshire and cream cheese the same. 4)Add 1/2 packet onion soup mix to mixture. 5)Cook on LOW only for 5 hours. 6) Add a dollop of sour cream also when adding cream cheese. 7) Add sauteed fresh mushrooms (about 4-6 oz) 1/2 hr before serving. 8) Serve over egg noodles. I followed these suggestions, and now my husband, who is a big fan of Hamburger Helper, wants this instead and thinks I am the stroganoff goddess. =) A keeper for the recipe box! I will make this often.","I think I've found my new favorite comfort food. This was really good. I used 2 pounds of round steak (just don't like stew meat), 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, added some onion soup mix (for flavor), and 1/2 cup water (I like gravy). To help the cream cheese melt easier, cube and soften it before adding. I like the idea of using cream cheese rather than the traditional sour cream because if you're lucky enough to have leftvovers, it reheats nicer than sour cream. I can't wait to make it again!","It really irks me when i come on here to get a good recipe with a good rating and people's reviews are all about the changes they made. I dont have time to read everyones reviews with all the changes to make this recipe ""better'. Rate the recipes as is and if you have modifications or change then post a new recipe!!!!!!!","5 stars for a great easy recipe for the busy on-the-go parent! Doubled the sauce!!! Added 1/2 tsp of fresh minced garlic, 1/2 packet of dry Italian-style salad dressing and 1/2 packet of Lipton's dry onion/ beefy/ mushroom soup mix to give the stroganoff extra flavor complexity. Subbed low sodium beef broth for the water, and low sodium worcestershire for the regular. Added sauteed mushrooms 1/2 hour prior to the finish and stirred in sour cream to taste prior to serving! Helpful hint: Check the intensity of your crockpot as some are ""hotter"" than others and you may not need to cook the stroganoff the full 8 hours as the recipe lists. Thanks Jessica - great recipe!","This tastes really good, but I found that because I floured and browned the meat (which naturally thickens the sauce) and added fresh mushrooms (which absorb a LOT of moisture), I increased the water to a full cup and still would have been happy with a thinner sauce. I liked the flavor enough to give this another try - this time no mushrooms and with a full soup can of water. I also think I'll use traditional sour cream instead - the cream cheese tasted very good, but I think the texture of the sour cream will suit my tastes better. That's the beauty of this recipe - it's a great place to take off & tinker to your preferences!","THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! My husband is the pickiest eater there is and he loved this. Hamburger Helper Stroganoff has been my husband's favorite since he was a little boy. I hated making it but did for him, till last night, I put my foot down and told I wanted to try this recipe. He hates mushroom and I did not really think he would like it. He ate a HUGE bowl at dinner, then pulled out the leftovers shortly before going to bed and ate ANOTHER HUGE BOWL. He told me he like this more than his favorite stroganoff. I used some of the other suggestions. I keep the meat(1 lb.), worcestershire(1 tbls.), and cream cheese(4 oz) the same. I doubled the soup(2 cans) and water(1/2 cup).I omitted the onions (husband hates them) but I did add half a pack of the lipton onion soup mix. Thank you so much for this recipe. I am sure I will be making this for a LONG time.",Awesome over egg noodles. Replace the water with sherry and substitute 1 packet onion soup mix for the onions. YUMMY!!!,"I am thrilled, thrilled, THRILLED to have found this recipe. My husband loves when I make stroganoff, but I hate all the work involved. Per the other reviewers' suggestions, I used sour cream, as well as the onion soup packet. Wonderful! I threw in a jar of mushrooms toward the end of cooking - I had a very happy hubby! Thanks for the EASY and delicious recipe!","I absolutely loved this recipe! It was soooo easy, AND, much better than other stroganoff recipes that I have used (I've used one recipe that called for sour cream, cream cheese, and cream soup.........clogged arteries!!!) I took the advice of some other reviews and I added a packet of dried onion soup mix. When I added the cream cheese at the end, I also threw in two handfuls of fresh mushrooms. It was the perfect touch. I will be adding this recipe to my permanent collection!!","I made this for the first time last night and followed the recommendations of Jillybean and others. I used: 2 pounds cubed sirloin steak 2 cans golden mushroom soup 1 large chopped onion 2 cloves garlic minced 1/2 pound sliced mushrooms 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon pepper 1/2 cup beef broth 1 pack onion soup mix 4 ounces cream cheese, softened. 4 ounces sour cream All but cream cheese and sour cream went into the crockpot and cooked for 6 hours, served over noodles and it was OMG Good! Thanks for sharing","I am only giving this 4 stars since I did take the advice of many reviewers and modified the recipe quite a bit. Instead of using a slow cooker, I cooked this in a dutch oven on top of the stove and it turned out really good. I served it over egg noodles, but my family likes it on rice better. I love the addition of the cream cheese instead of sour cream, too! Instead of buying exspensive stew meat, I bought a chuck roast and cut it up myself. ***Update: I made this again and didn't add the cream cheese due to not having any. It was still delicious. Probably not truly considered stroganoff, though. My family prefers it on rice, too.","Jessica, thank you for posting this fantastic base recipe, I like many others did not follow it to the letter, but without your recipe wouldnt have tried it at all! I give this 5 stars because your base recipe is the cornerstone of it all! I always read the reviews of whatever recipe I am going to try, and then make my own changes accordingly. I had a few pounds of cube steak that I wanted to use up and make tender, and this fit the bill...I sliced some onions thick and layered them first, then I cut up the cube steak, didnt brown or flour it at all....put in half a pack of beefy onion soup, tablespoon of Lea and perrins, cup of water, two cans of golden mushroom soup (we like a thick gravy here, lol) and about a heaping teaspoon of ground pepper....let that all simmer in the crock pot for about 5 hours...then added about 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms...let it cook on low another hour...then added half a bar of low fat cream cheese then 8oz of sour cream...served over wide egg noodles and it was a HUGE hit in my household of three...made enough that we had it again last night and it tasted even better! Great use for cube steak btw, a good cheap option...Thanks again Jessica, this will be a staple in my house this winter!","So many reviewers said follow jillybean14's suggestions - I finally found her on page 45. To help out, here is what she suggests: (1) add salt, pepper and garlic, (2)double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worchestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hrs. on low (5) add a ""dollup"" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra ""tang"", (6) add a boullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles (9) add sauteed mushrooms, about 1/2 an hour before serving.","Hubby's first words were...""This is awesome."" This turned out great and was super easy. Perfect for a cold winter evening or company! However I did add a few things and made a few simple changes after looking at a couple of the other recipes. Here is what I did. 1 can of golden mushroom soup and half can of cream of mushroom, whole package of fresh sliced mushrooms, 3 sliced green onions and half a chopped yellow onion. 1 can of beef broth instead of any water. I seasoned the cubed stew beef with seasoning salt ( and if you cook it on low for 6-8 hours it does NOT toughen up, ours was sooo tender! So save a few bucks and get the stew meat!). Cooked on low for 6 hours and served over buttered noodles with parsley. I would actually add more mushrooms next time. The last hour I put in 8 oz of low fat sour cream and 3 heaping tablespoons of nonfat cream cheese. I then took 1 tbls of corn starch (you could use flour) and mixed it with milk to thicken the sauce. It was pretty thick already so I would only add it if you like a thicker sauce. Putting the cream cheese in the last hour gave it plenty of time to combine and cook down so it was not chunky. Perfection!!",Great recipe! I did change it a little bit. I used a round steak and coated it with flour and browned it before I put it in the crock pot. I also added a can of beef broth to the mix and used the whole brick of cream cheese. Turns out great every time!,"Always on the lookout for sure-fire slow cooker meals and this was great, so thanks Jessica and also JILLYBEAN14 and other reviewers. (Given that I followed Jilly's modifications.) Received compliments all around for this. Definitely a keeper to make again, nice comfort fare.","I made a lot of changes based on reviews. I use following: 2 lbs stew meat, 2 cans golden cream of mushroom, 1 med onion diced, 2 cloves garlic minced, 1 beef bullion, 2T Worcestershire. Sauce, 1 pkt onion soup mix, 1/2 c.-ish beef broth, sliced mushrooms, & 4 oz. cream cheese. Cook 8 hours on low and add cream cheese about 30-60 minutes before serving. I've made this dozens of times and I no longer measure and it always turns out great. Since there is only two of us and I don't want left overs I use 1 lb stew meat, 1 can golden mushroom soup in a smaller crockpot on low for 5-6 hours and everything else the same and it's still good.","My husband thought it to be a bit bland as far as flavor goes, but I just added some more Worcestershire sauce to the dish once it was done and it tasted a lot better, other than that I just used sour cream instead of cream cheese and this dish was super yummy! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make it again!","Wow! Just delicious! We will for sure make this again and again. I did all the alterations recommended by other reviewers though. 2 lb stew meat, 2 cans soup, 1/2 cup beef broth instead of water, added salt, pepper and garlic powder, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, sauteed mushrooms in butter and added at end and dollop of sour cream. Cooked on low 5 hrs. It was to DIE for! We served over egg noodles with a side of boiled potatoes with a butter/dill sauce. Its also great warmed up the next day!","I found this recipe 5 years ago and just now deciding I should add my two cents - I like to think I've perfected it, somewhat. For the more picky cook, it helps to brown your beef. No need to, but it definitely brings out more flavor. We're two guys so one pound of beef just doesn't cut it for wanting to have this for dinner for a few nights, so I sometimes double or triple the recipe, especially if we're having company. I toss in a bit more extra worcestershire sauce, like about one tablespoon extra. I've spent quite a bit of time in Russia and can tell you this little recipe would (and HAS) satisfied a picky Russian... and those Russians know their stroganoff! ;-) As others have said, a cube of beef bouillon doesn't hurt but if you think it needs more seasoning, go for it! I always add a touch of Cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit, but I have Cajun roots so, that's just me. Finally, I ALWAYS add mushrooms near the end. Take an 8oz or more pack of baby bellas, slices em up, toss them in a pan and sauté with some butter, then set aside. In the last hour or two of cooking, toss them in and stir. Seriously, you gotta do this. It adds the authentic stroganoff taste and texture and jacks up the recipe a bit if you're feeding a hungry family. Excellent recipe - this recipe is the reason I've become a slow cooker guy and I'd love to meet the person who posted it and shake their hands or give 'em a hug. It's just that good!!","And I have never made homemade stroganoff before! I made some changes, based on Jillybean14's review, who summed up the 500+ reviews on here (thank you!). To do what Jillybean did, and save others some time, here is what all these reviews say to do: 1)Add some salt,pepper, and garlic to the pot. 2) Double the meat. 3) Double the soup and water but keep worchestshire and cream cheese the same. 4)Add 1/2 packet onion soup mix to mixture. 5)Cook on LOW only for 5 hours. 6) Add a dollop of sour cream also when adding cream cheese. 7) Add sauteed fresh mushrooms (about 4-6 oz) 1/2 hr before serving. 8) Serve over egg noodles.","See JillyBean14's Review which I copied here: I read almost all of the 400+ reviews and made modifications based on them. To save everyone else some time, here's what they say to do (and what I did...and it came out great): (1) add salt, pepper, and garlic, (2) double the sauce but keep the cream cheese and worcestershire the same, (3) use Golden Mushroom, not Cream of Mushroom or don't make this at all, (4) reduce the cooking time to about 5-6 hours on low, (5) add a ""dollup"" of sour cream when you add the cream cheese to get an extra ""tang"", (6) add a bullion cube, (7) add a half packet of onion soup mix, (8) serve over egg noodles, (9) add sauteed mushrooms about 1/2 an hour before serving. I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted others and I think it helped. Great slow-cooker recipe. I froze the leftovers (egg noodles and all) in my Seal-a-Meal and then just boiled the bag to reheat. It was great the second time around! The only thing I did differently was skip the onion soupd mix - can't stand it. Whole family LOVED this recipe. Highly recommend it!!","I took some of the suggestions from other readers and added some extra mushrooms and more meat. I used the golden mushroom soup and also added a can of beefy mushroom soup and eliminated the suggestion of onion soup. I added some pepper and garlic. I did not use Cream Cheese as I don't care for the cream cheese flavor in casseroles - it just seems to overpower everything else. I used about a cup of sour cream as I had a lot of sauce. If I were to make it again, I'd probably not use the second can of soup as there was just so much sauce. That said, hubby and I enjoyed this a lot and I'll probably make it again with a few adjustments to strive for that 5th. star.","I made this using the exact recipe. Because of my work schedule mine ended up cooking on low for about 10 hours. My only regret is that for some reason my onions never got soft. Next time I'll saute them a bit first. The ingredients were simple, and we liked the end result. We'll definately be making this again!","Okay this is a good basic recipe. I double the recipe. Used half golden mushroom and half roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup. Added one package beefy onion soup mix. Also added some cooking sherry (1/4 cup). An hour or so before serving, added fresh sliced mushrooms (about 1.5 cups).","Extremely bland, and the cream cheese left little chunks because of combining it with heat (didn't consider at the time).","this is really good AS LONG AS YOU MAKE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES: (Jillybean14 read all the reviews and summarized the changes that needed to be made. These are her changes) 2 pounds cubed beef stew meat 2 cans golden mushroom soup 1/2 cup chopped onion 1/2 packet of dry onion soup mix 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup water 4 ounces cream cheese spoonful of sour cream Follow the directions listed on the recipe. Add a bit of salt, pepper & garlic to the pot along with everything else. Stir in spoonful of sour cream at the same time you stir in cream cheese. my 4 year old and 2 year old couldn't get enough of this. I served it over wide-cut egg noodles. It was done in exactly 5 hours on low. I will definitely make this again. remember - don't sub the golden mushroom soup. it has to be golden mushroom.",,,,,
45,If you want to try bringing this to an even better state of Nirvana: Use only 1/2 lb of beef and add 1/2 pound of ground pork. Also replace skim milk with 1/2 a cup of ricotta cheese. I think you'll find you'll have some moister more flavorful meatballs.,"I've been using LTH's recipe for some time now and its my staple. I have subbed an egg for the milk without any problems. Also, I never have seasoned bread crumbs so I just up the Italian seasoning (can't tell you by how much cause I don't measure this recipe anymore). If I'm just making this for myself, I add some additional sriacha for more heat (or if I don't have the Frank's at home) I bake these on a slightly greased cookie sheet and flip halfway. These freeze great cooked or raw. Oh and I've used 80/20, 90/10, and 95/5 beef with these and they've all turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!!!","Thank you , everyone, for the glowing reviews! We at the LTH house LOVE these meatballs! I almost always at least triple the recipe when I make it so I can freeze a few bags of meatballs. I bake and then freeze the baked meatballs. I'm kinda lazy (ok, a lot lazy) and never feel like taking the time to place the cooked meatballs on a cookie sheet, freeze them, then bag them. I'm lucky if I let them cool before I toss them in a freezer bag and chuck 'em in the freezer. I freeze them in freezer bags without sauce. It makes for crazy easy meals when no one planned ahead/feels like cooking! These do have a nice bite, so adjust the crushed red and hot pepper sauce (Red Hot at our house) to YOUR tastes. I also rarely ever feel like dicing an onion (I'm lazy, remember?) so I usually sub dried minced. I also tend to forget that my aversion to black pepper is generally abnormal, so, if you're not a freak like me, you may choose to add some black pepper, too! Come as you are and enjoy Meatball Nirvana! :)","Hubs wanted meatballs as part of our ""SuperBowl Smorgasbord."" I have my own way of making meatballs, but since I was using these on their own rather than with spaghetti, I kind of wanted to try something completely different, and in terms of how I make my Italian meatballs, these are different. Italian seasoning, oregano, garlic salt, hot pepper sauce and Worcerstershire sauce are all different additions for me and, other than omitting the red pepper and hot sauce in consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards, I resisted the strong urge to make these more compliant with what I was familiar with. I popped half of one in my mouth and ""Mmmm!"" ran through my mind. They have a nice balance of flavors that will only get better once the flavors develop even further in my homemade tomato sauce, I thought. I had Hubs taste the other half and the first word out of his meatball stuffed mouth was, ""Yum!"" (Trust me, he NEVER says ""yum"") I've got more cooking to do to complete our smorgasbord (Go Pack!!!) but these meatballs are going to be one, fine contribution. Way to go (again!) LovestoHost!","Excellent meatball recipe. This is good in homemade BBQ sauce or a good marinara and also in meatball sandwiches. Dosen't matter how you use it, it always turns out fantastic. This also works well with ground turkey or chicken and even adding a little italian sausage is good, too. I do like to use my own homemade italian seasoning and homemade seasoned bread crumbs (brush day old bread with garlic butter, bake until crispy, then run through the food processor until finely ground) in this recipe I also do what LTH does and double it because either my boys eat them all up or I'll make one batch and freeze the other. If you have any leftovers, it's even better the next day. GOOD STUFF.","This recipe gets 5 stars for balance of ingredients and flavor... but gets 3 stars for instructions. The ingredients balance well, and the meatballs have a great taste. There are a few things I experimented with to improve this recipe. First, I reduced the salt, and used garlic powder (not garlic salt). I also did not dice the onion, I grated the onion on a small grater, and grated it over the bowl, so the onion juices blended into the meatballs, and you're not left with large bits of onion. One of the biggest steps is to combine all the ingredients EXCEPT the beef, and allow this mixture to sit for 5 minute before including the beef. This way, the bread crumbs absorb the moisture of the milk and the flavors blend. Once you're ready to mix the beef in, use only your fingertips, and blend gently being careful not to over-blend. Taking this step, you create a more moist, light and delicate meatball. The instructions as written in this recipe will likely cause the meatball to get dry, dense, and hard. Again, delicious balance of flavors, but the method of mixing the meatballs is not the best.","Great recipe for meatballs! I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt, 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes (was adding hot sausage to the sauce as well and didn't want things too spicy), and used an egg in place of the skim milk. This was a nice change from my usual meatball recipe - thanks LTH!",LOVE! I've never been 100% satisfied with any meatball recipe until now. The kick from the crushed red pepper and hot sauce really make these something special. I served them on hoagie rolls with sauce and cheese. Delicious. I might even go so far as to say that they deserve a fist pump.... ;) Thanks LTH!,"My kids was served this with Nana's Pasta sauce by EAKE, and my son said it was better then Subway's meatball sub. WOW, is what I thought. 3 of my kids had 2 hot dog size meatball subs a piece. And I tried the meatballs myself and thought it was delicious by slightly on the salty side, I think I would omit the salt the next time I make these(for my prefences) It had such a wonderful aroma of flavors. I really enjoyed it. However, my kids said it was slightly spice on some crunchy pieces but I guess that means the red pepper flakes. But all agreed it was loved. I think possibly use cayenne powder in the place of the red pepper flakes just for them. But I saw no problems with the red pepper flakes....but I have to apease to the children. I will so keep this recipe in my box, because not only was it good, it's the 1st meatball I've ever made that was cooked all the way through and moist, not hard or stiff. Thanks lovetohost.","I have had this recipe saved for the longest time, and I finally got around to making it. I followed this to the letter, and I can't fathom any changes I would possible make. Let me tell you a little something about me and meatballs- I have a torrid love affair with them. The ultimate in comfort food, I love them on top of spaghetti (all covered with cheese), on hoagies, and, if they are good enough, all by their lonesome. I made these knowing they were going straight into the freezer, but I had to try one. Then two. Then my kid wandered into the kitchen, and we talked shoes and boys, all the while stuffing meatballs in our faces. Yes. They are THAT good. I tried them on spaghetti- awesome. Next, I will create a meatball hoagie the likes of which would make an Italian Grandma weep. I love, nay, I ADORE these meatballs! Thank you lovestohost- there may be other meatballs in my life from time to time, but I will secretly be longing for these whilst I eat those lowly wannabes :)","These are the best tasting meatballs we have ever eaten!!! We followed the recipe as written and used a large cookie scoop to keep them equal shaped. The kids loved to roll them into a ball. They had tons of flavor, next time I might try to cook them in sauce for spaghetti and meatballs. However you use these you will not be dissapointed!! Great recipe.","I took a leap of faith and quadrupled this recipe and it was worth the risk! Sooo wonderful! I used ground sirloin. I was alittle worried about not using any egg but I followed the recipe to a ""T"" other than using fresh garlic and reducing the crushed red pepper to a 1/4 proportionally to suit my family. I made a pot of sauce and had pasta and subs last week. I intended to freeze them in bags but ended up making family size portioned containers and froze them in my sauce. Gave one to DD and she loved them. Each pound made a dozen meatballs slightly larger than a golfball. I have a convection oven so 15 minutes cooked them nicely. Thanks LTH, I will be making these again soon!! (As long as the fam doesn't OD on them in the mean time!)","Fantastic!! I have prepared dozens of recipes off of this site - some have even become staple meals at my home and I have never left a review. These meatballs are great! Only minor changes on my part. I used 2lbs lean ground beef and 1lb ground pork sausage. I basically tripled the other ingredients (I am not a seasoning measurer). I omitted pepper sauce and cut down on pepper flakes ONLY because of my kids - would have added if making for adults. I only double the seasoned bread crumbs (1 cup) and used oatmeal (1/2 cup) to finish what I needed, as I don't like the taste of the pre-seasoned breadcrumbs. Needed a little more milk. This made 40 meatballs larger than a golf ball. Filled my jellyroll pan. I baked for 10 minutes, then moved a little more than half of them to my pot of spagetti sauce to finish cooking on simmer. I finished baking the other half as directed and used them for meatball sandwiches the next day. For the meatball sandwiches, I LIGHTLY buttered split french bread, sprinkled with garlic powder, covered both sides with mozzarella and fresh parmesean cheeses and broiled till bubbly. put warmed meatballs on bread and drizzle with warmed marinara sauce - YUM! Next time, I will tear fresh basil UNDER the cheese before broiling. Thanks lovestohost!","We love these meatballs! We've been making them for over a year now and they are perfect for our family as my son is allergic to eggs and this is one of the only recipes I've found that doesn't include eggs. I decrease the pepper flakes to just a pinch since my three year old is eating them. They have a nice flavor compared to a lot of other meatballs I've tried that seem rather bland. Thanks for the recipe, LTH!","This meatball recipe is fantastic! For those that have reviewed my recipe reviews, I double or triple the garlic which I did for this recipe. Everything else, I followed to a T and then added 2 eggs which my Italian family has always done which bulks up the meatball a bit while baking. I then quickly put together a meat sauce with 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, 1 Tbsp of garlic, 1/2 cup of onions, salt and pepper to taste (let these cook until the onion has lost its whiteness), 1 C of organic ground beef (cook until brown), then added 1 24 oz can of stewed/chopped tomatoes, 4 fresh tomatoes in which I blanched, chopped, and added to the sauce, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 cup of red wine (the stronger the better). I then used the water from the blanched tomatoes to cook the Fettucine (which adds a delicious infused taste), and when the meatballs were done, I added them to the sauce. Dinner was great and I'll definitely be using the recipe again. THANKS!","I have been looking for a meatball recipe for as long as I've been cooking---at least 25 years! I can't ground pork where I live, so I used 80/20 sirloin. These were by far the best meatballs I have EVER made. I only used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and they were still too hot for me---but other than that, they were perfect. I didn't change a thing, except I used Club cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. These meatballs were reminiscent of Flora's, an old Italian eatery I frequented as a kid. I've been trying to reproduce that flavor. These are so moist, not dry at all (I mixed everything for about 20 seconds with my hand mixer to keep it from getting dense and tough). I cannot wait to try them on crusty Italian bread with marinara and melted mozzarella!",Delicious! Made these for my hubby and his father and they loved them! I used more than a lb of ground sirloin 90/10 and added more ingredients as needed. Mixed with sauce and served over pasta and it was an amazing dinner. Will definitely make again,"Outstanding recipe! I'm not sure why other people choose to leave out the red pepper flakes and hot sauce. It does NOT make it spicy, it only adds an additional layer of flavor that makes this recipe even more awesome! Made them with spaghetti sauce and pasta and it was a big hit!","LTH, I tip my hat to you and this recipe. I looked at these meat balls so many times, but have never made meat balls without eggs as a binder (or following a recipe-it's always a handful of this and splash of that). I bit the bullet and tried them. They are great!! Nicely spiced and they held together wonderfully. I had minestrone soup minus the noodles left over from the weekend. I pureed it in the food processor, added tomato paste and a few fresh tomatoes. Cooked the meatballs in the oven, transferred them to a crock pot with my new sauce and left them alone to get aquainted. Served over spaghetti with garlic toasts. My only regret is not trying these sooner. Next on the menu will be to master balls into Swedish meatballs. Thanks for the recipe.",These meatballs were delicious! I've been looking for a good Italian Meatball recipe for a long time and I think I have found the one. Served on spaghetti for dinner and on good crusty rolls as leftovers the next night.,"An excellent recipe, the only change I would make is to grate the onion to mix it more evenly with with the meat. Also, why salt then garlic salt? Maybe a grated clove of fresh garlic and then 3/4 tsp kosher salt.... We left out the hot pepper(s) because our young son was eating them as well. We simmered in sauce once cooked to add flavour to the sauce. Loved the tenderness and texture.","These were great! I wish I'd erred a little more on the side of spicy.. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I just added a few extra dashes of Crystal hot sauce, and I should have added more. My kids ate the snot out of them, though, had to cut them off so we could have leftovers. I did commit a sin though. *hangs head in shame* Instead of baking them, I seared them in a little olive oil and butter then just cooked them off in the sauce. In my defense, it's a trillion degrees here and the thought of turning the oven on upset my tummy! Besides, butter makes everything better!","We love meatballs. We haven't found a meatball we didn't like, until now. The bread crumbs and seasonings were over powering. I tried these a few different ways (on pasta, in a sandwich, ...) I'm sure there are tweaks I could make to improve it for our taste, but I'm just going to start over with another recipe.",This recipe is/was absolutely wonderful.,My boys LOVE these-especially my 4 yr old! I decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp & they had just enough kick for the kiddos. Thanks for another GREAT recipe!!,"That'sa spicy meatball...( in my ""Old Italian Man voice"") lol... Very flavorful and good!.. If you don't like spicy omit some of the red pepper/hot sauce but we loved them just as they are!... I doubled the recipe and served on whole wheat spaghetti tonight; we will probably use the rest for meatball subs tomorrow. My modifications were to omit the oregano because it's already in my Italian seasonings; I didn't have enough worcestershire so I used steak sauce... :)","I found this recipes a few years ago on this site. Everyone in my family loves it. When my son married two years ago, he made sure that he and his new wife got a copy and it is also a staple in their home. I always serve it with my home made sauce. I prepared these last year when my sister-in-law came from out of town. She ate them plain and just raved about them. You can't go wrong with this recipe. I try to watch salt content or all of my recipes so I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Also depending on who is eating with us, I sometimes decrease or omit the red pepper flakes.","The only thing I do differently (this comes from a 100 year old family italian meatball recipe) is to make a well within the meat mixture and add the parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, milk and mix them up into a slurry...and wait a few minutes. Then combine this into the meat mixture, form into balls and let sit in the fridge for an hour to ""set up."" Instead of baking them, the cooled meatballs are added into spaghetti sauce that is simmering on the stove. Let the sauce and meatballs cook together (which I'm told from my Italian family that I married into) is the best way to avoid tough meatballs. I have to agree with them. After an hour on the stove with bubbling tomato sauce, the meatballs are fabulous and add flavor!","I made these last night and they were amazing. ""Mmmmm aahh these meatballs are deeeelicious"" my boyfriend says. I did leave out the parmesan, because I didn't have any. I did a mix of spices for the Italian Seasoning, and used my homemade wheat breadcrumbs. I didn't bake them but did the technique of dropping them into hot spaghetti sauce and cooking them in the sauce. They were amazingly good. Thank you lovestohost this will be my standard meatball recipe!",I have never been able to make a meatball that I loved....until now!!! Very tasty:),"I made these as written except for subbing garlic powder for the garlic salt, and they were wonderful. Doubled the batch as making twice as much takes no more effort, and I could tell by reading the recipe that I would probably like them. First night we had Meatball Nirvana Sandwiches, next night with pasta. Do try to mince the onion as small as possible to blend easily. This would probably make delicious mini-meatloaves, too.",,,,,
46,"I have made several times--my teenagers love it. I do make a couple of changes. I add garlic, black pepper, (just a dash) and a couple of tablespoons of Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce. AND a little more salt. Use a heavy beer--no lite stuff-- It REALLY helps the flavor--gives it more depth. After a couple of different cuts of beef, I've found a siroin tip roast to be the best. Also if you let it cool a few minutes before slicing and add back to the juices for a while, it is much more flavorful. I love the buttered rolls with the au jus---melt provolone cheese under the broiler--yum!","Wish I could make it 10 stars!! This recipe tales TIME..to cook, don't rush it! Slice your beef about 1/2 hr before you want to serve it and return it to juice. Wow!!! But wait, the next day take the leftover juice with bits of beef and make French onion soup with it. Serve over the leftover french bread in a bowl with cheese and slip it under the broiler for a minute. The BEST!!","I've relied on this recipe so many times before finally getting around to reviewing it. It's that good, and that easy. I always use a chuck roast. Even though it may not slice well, I believe it has superior flavor and is really well suited to slow cooking. It shreds up nicely, and is easy to spoon onto rolls for sandwiches. I use Guiness Draught, tho' I'm sure most any beer would work well, and I also add a few shakes of garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.","I tried this recipe as is the first time and found it lacked some definitive quality. The second time I put the meat into the cooker with 1 pkt onion soup mix and 2c. beef broth, and added 1 sprig Rosemary, 1 large garlic clove, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp thyme and 1/4 c. soya sauce. I served this with French Bread Rolls to Die fOR. Raves from all my guests. Perfect with changes.","This is SOOOOO YUMMMMY!!!... My husband and I love it!!... I made just a few changes..I sprinkled my roast with some garlic powder and worchestire sauce when I put it in the crockpot.. I also added a can of mushrooms (drained).. When the meat was ready to be sliced I took it out and sliced it very thin and even shredded a few pieces, then put the meat back in the crockpot for 30 more minutes to soak into the juice.. I didnt put butter on our french bread, instead I toasted it with some shredded mozarella on it... The juice is so good and it smelled so good while it was cooking.. While I was slicing the meat my husband was eating it right out of the crockpot!!!...LOL..He has already requested it for next weekend when we have friends coming over.. Kiki (Brampton,On Canada)","Holy Moly!! Yum!! I added the onion salt as suggested, also added garlic salt and minced garlic to taste,1 tea. worchestershire sauce, and had fesh mushrooms to throw in. I also sliced it thin and put it back in the juice to steep a short time. I put in on the toasted buns with Provalone cheese. This was awesome. I have leftover juices and thin slice beef to use as leftovers. I'll heat, thicken with cornstarch and serve over noodles. My husband will be in heaven again. Thank you for sharing. Pepperocini Beef was also five stars. Don't miss these two recipes.","FANTASTIC! MUCH better than any French dip recipe I've tried (including Giselle's French dips, another popular AR recipe). I waited quite a while to try this for 2 reasons. First, I had such a mediocre experience w/ Giselle's recipe, I wasn't in any hurry to make French dips again. Second, I thought these would be SUPER bland. Boy, was I wrong! :) Having said this, I did make a few minor changes. I rubbed my roast w/ .5 t ea. garlic / onion salt & pepper & added 1 T W sauce / .5 t of minced garlic to my crockpot. My beer of choice was 1554 (a dark ale made by New Belgium Brewing Co. - the same company that produces Fat Tire). I used plain 'ol beef broth, but next time I'm gonna use beef consomme (it's more concentrated / stronger). There are a couple of things to note: First & foremost, use a DARK beer. A stout or dark ale is perfect. Light beers will leave you w/ weak au jus. Next, a rump roast is also referred to as a bottom round roast. A chuck roast will also work, but will make your au jus greasy (it's a fatty cut of meat) & won't slice nicely (it's great for shredded dips). Finally, remove your meat, allow to rest for 10 min. & thinly slice / add back to the sc for ~ an hr. (to soak up the flavor of the au jus). Homemade onion rolls (claudygirl) toasted w/ garlic butter, piled w/ provolone / sauteed onions, spread w/ horsey sauce, broiled & served w/ au jus made for AWESOME samies. :-) I bet leftover au jus will be a GREAT base for French onion soup! Thanks lownwolf!","This recipe is a hit in my house - hubby & kids just love it. Be sure to use the darkest, most syrupy beer you can find (e.g., Guinness) - it really makes a difference in the richness and overall flavor of the au jus. Yummy!!!","Made this yesterday for a VERY tasty supper! I Don't own a slow cooker so I used one of my corning ware casserole dishes and put the roast in the oven for 8 hours at 250 degrees. It worked marvelously! Instead of beer I used red wine. (Ancient Coast's Baco Noir, for any of you Canadian reviewers who are looking for an excellent red!) I also added a tbsp of worcestershire, some onion and garlic powder and some thyme. We used hot buttered and oven toasted baguette for the sandwhiches, and broiled some sliced mozarella on top. A true taste sensation, and although frenh dip is not truly authentic french fare, my French Canadian husband gave this 10 stars! Bon Appetit!","I added 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 Tablespoon worshesire. 7 hours is perfect for a 4 pound rump roast. Cut meat as thin as possible. Makes plenty of ""a jus"". My first crock-pot recipe and it is awesome. I highly recommend. Even better the next day",This was bland. And the meat took on the weirdest texture. What could I possibly have done wrong?,"For restaurant quality, make the following changes: Use 1 pkg Dry lipton soup mix and an additional can of beef broth/consume instead of the canned onion soup for a stronger flavor. Butter your rolls after you split them, sprinkle with garlic, add shredded beef, top with provolone cheese and broil until cheese is bubbly. If you really want to improve this recipe add some sauteed onions and mushrooms. I always do!","I couldn't read all 300 reviews (so forgive me if this has already been pointed out), but I thought I would add that instead of the beer, you can substitute a can of cola, just not diet. This is a very easy and timesaving recipe. It's also good served as is with vegetables as a main course.","Depending on what is in the freezer, I vary between a sirloin tip as it easily slices easier than other cuts, and a chuck roast which imparts more flavor. I season my roast the evening before with a mix of garlic and onion powder, fresh ground black pepper and kosher salt letting it absorb the flavors. Add to the crockpot in the morning, along with the other ingredients and darkest syrup beer you can find and you're in business! As other reviewers have noted, slicing the beef and adding back to the crockpot WITH the juices allows it to absorb more flavor. You just can't go wrong with this recipe! Superb!","HELP recipe reviers!! I have made this twice and both times it comes out so dry I could make shoes with it. I like the broth and we've put melted cheese and grilled onions on it, but the meat is still dry. I really want to like this recipe but I think I am doing something wrong with the cut of meat. Can't always find rump roast, so what would you use? The butcher at the store the other day said ""bottom round roast"" was the same as rump roast, but it tasted awful. What cut of meat are people using where they are getting such good results?? Thanks!","This was so easy to get together and was really tasty. I made it exactly as the recipe states but added a little garlic and a few shakes of worcestire sauce to the sauce. I also used a sirloin tip roast because it was on sale, but, it worked perfectly. The sandwich was good, but, the leftovers were amazing! I saved the leftover dipping sauce along with the beef. I didn't have much fat from the roast because it was very lean, so, I melted 3 tablespoons of butter in a pan then whisked in 3 big tablespoons of flour and cooked it for a few minutes. I then added a little bit of the dipping sauce from the roast and whisked it into the flour to get rid of any lumps. I gradually added the rest of the dipping sauce into the pan whisking continually. Bring the gravy to a boil and then down to a simmer. Depending on how much of the dipping sauce you used with the sandwiches you may need to add a little beef broth if the gravy is too thick. We didn't use much of the sauce the first night so had plenty left over. I sliced the leftover beef in slices and put into the gravy for about 7 minutes to warm up. I served with whipped garlic mashed potatoes and baby peas. The meat was unbelievably tender in the gravy and my husband said if you could bottle the gravy you would be a millionaire! Definitely try your leftover beef using the sauce as a gravy. Yummy!","This was so delicious! I did not use the beer, and used some extra Knorr french onion soup mix, as well as a boullion cube with about 12 oz. of water to make up the missing liquid. I also added a few shakes of worchester sauce and some garlic powder as some other reviews had suggested. I sliced the beef as thinly as I could with a regular knife and returned to the crock pot for the last hour, and the beef was so tender and juicy. The cut of meat I used was a sirloin roast. It was so easy and so good, that I will make this again and again for my family.","If you dislike beer, don't let this recipe scare you! I hate beer, but I LOVED this sandwich!","Oh my God this is a great recipe!!! The only thing I did differently was add a little more salt. I used a 12 oz. bottle of MGD and Campbells brand beef broth and french onion soup - they are condensed so they have more flavor. Cooked it for 7 hours per the recipe, sliced it (if it falls apart when slicing, turn it and slice it the other way) and put it back in the crock pot for another 30 mins or so. Buttering the rolls and putting them in the oven REALLY helped to make this taste great as well. This is one of the best recipes I've had from this site!",I've made this several times with different beers and it comes out great every time.,"This is a good recipe with the Guinness and next time I will try it with some red wine instead. I used ½ can of Guinness and could detect the flavor in the sauce at the end but it was good with the meat. My DH just didn’t dip in it very much so next time the wine. I slivered garlic and poked it in the meat in several places and covered the meat with Roast Seasoning; then topped with some dry oregano, chopped fresh rosemary and a few splashes of Worcestershire. For the sauce I used a can of Campbell’s Consommé, a can of Campbell’s Onion Soup, and some Swanson’s Chicken Broth and ½ of a 15 oz can of Guinness (St. James Draught). To the soup I added: 2 sprigs Thyme, 1 sprig Rosemary, Bay Leaf, pinch dry oregano, pinch of sugar, ½ onion, sliced, garlic cloves, roughly cut, a small cut-up carrot, and 3 sun dried tomatoes. I also agree that slicing the meat ahead of time and then returning it to the pot for about an hour is a big help! I will definitely do this one again with some red wine. THANKS TO YOU ALL FOR HELPING THE REST OF US READERS MAKE OUR DINNERS BETTER WITH YOUR ADVICE!","WOW! This was incredible! I don't purchase beer, so we used worchestire, beef boullion cubes, onion soup mix, garlic salt, and onion powder like suggested. I was nervous about it-I didn't know how it would turn out and I was serving it to guests. But it turned out perfect! I also cut the meat an hour before and let it soak in the juice for the last hour. I served it with French Bread Rolls to Die For (also on this site), and it was a HUGE hit! My family even requested it again tonite! Thanks for the recipe and everyone who gave tips in their reviews! This is my favorite recipe from this site!",This was wonderful and I know I will be making it again. The sauce for dipping is perfect with just a hint of the beer that isn't overpowering. The only thing I will change next time is to add onions.,5 stars for this! I added a few Tablespoons of worchestershire and some garlic salt because I felt the end product lacked a little flavor and with these changes it was perfect! Served it up on some dutch crunch rolls with mayo and provolone cheese! Delicious dinner! Thanks for the recipe!,"I make this on a semi-regular basis, but with a few alterations that make a very tasty French Dip. I use 1 cup soy sauce, 1 can of Campbells Beef Consumme' soup, 1 packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix and 6 cups of water. I also add 5 garlic cloves, 1 bay leaf and a sprig of fresh rosemary. So yummy!","I have made this several times, and with a few changes it is a great recipe. I used chuck roast, which is seared first with a coating of garlic salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. I used 2 packages of Knorr french onion soup mix, 2 cans of beef broth, and one 12 oz can of light beer (we like lots of au jus). I cook it for about 7-8 hours, then shred the beef, and put it back for another hour or two. I toast the bread under the broiler, and add provolone cheese to the sandwich. Simply perfect! Thanks!","We loved this recipe. I took some tips from other users and used a chuck roast. I put the roast, beer, dried onion, worcestire, garlic salt, garlic powder,pepper, beef stock, au jus gravy pack, and french onion soup into the crock and let it cook on low for eight hours, basting once in awhile. I sliced up the meat and returned to the juice for additional hour. I buttered the rolls, added some shredded cheese and put the under the broiler for about 7 minutes. The meet was so tender and the dipping sauce was excellent. I will definitely make this again! So easy, the crock does all the work!",,,,,,,,,
47,"I have made this several times now, and have found two main factors that make the difference between this being a 3* and a 5* meal. 1. Use at least 2 or 3 tortillas thick per layer. Otherwise, it gets soggy and mushy. 2. Let the meat simmer with the sauce at least 30 minutes, otherwise it does not meld together. This is a great recipe all in all, though, and I always look forward to making it. It is also a great freezer-to-oven meal. Simply take it out of the freezer and cook it at 350 for 40-50 minutes, or until bubbly. I always divide a full batch into several 11X7 pans, so I can freeze a couple for future meals. VERY IMPORTANT: I FREEZE IN A FOIL PAN...IF YOU FREEZE IN A GLASS PAN, YOU CAN'T PUT IT STRAIGHT INTO THE OVEN, OR ELSE THE GLASS WILL SHATTER. DEFROST IT FIRST.","Boy am I glad I didn't follow the advice of other reviewers to cut this recipe in half! This was absolutely delicious! Any easy, too! This is the first recipe I've made in a LONG time where everyone at the table cleaned their plates - and asked for seconds (or thirds in my husband's case!). With two young kids (3 and 5) this rarely happens (unless we're having hot dogs!) Using the same amounts of ingredients as called for in the recipe, I divided it up to make two different casseroles, a spicier version for me and my husband and a mild version for the kids. After browning the ground beef and onions, I divided the meat before adding the taco sauce. I used medium sauce for the adult dish and mild for the kids. For the adult dish I used all of the same ingredients as called for in the recipe (except olives). For the kids, I just used tortillas, ground beef/onions/taco sauce, refried beans and cheese. They loved it! Rather than mixing the refried beans into the beef mixture, I used a spoon to spread them on top of the tortillas before adding the beef mixture. This worked very well and allowed me to adjust the amount to suit our tastes. I ended up using about 1.5 cans between the two dishes. This will definitely become a regular in our house. Thanks for a delicious, easy recipe that made dinner a very enjoyable occasion after a long day at work. I can't wait to share the recipe with others.","This deserves ten stars! Absolutely amazing dish. I made this when I was visiting my parents and it was a HUGE hit. None of us were expecting to be so crazy about it, but wow. I'm trying to cut red meat out of my parents' diets, so I substituted the beef with turkey--without telling them (my dad wouldn't have tried it otherwise). I added some spices--cumin, season all, a couple of different kinds of pepper. I also did as others suggested and used one can black beans, one can spicy refried beans. I would up forgetting to add the taco seasoning, but it definitely wasn't missed. Instead of taco sauce, I used chunky salsa. I served it with a handful of shredded lettuce, a couple of spoonfuls of fat free sour cream, and extra salsa on the top. This made a nice sized casserole--I had to cut the tortillas to fit, though, because I bought the extra large ones and only had a...whatever the normal size cass. dish is. It's a very filling meal, and mom ended up freezing half of it, which she told me they plan on eating this coming week. There was *still* enough for us to have left overs the next day--it tasted just as good after a night in the fridge, by the way. Fat free tortillas aren't your best bet for this, just fyi. I was hesitant about them, so I only used one in the middle, the rest were regular tortillas. Upon later inspection, the fat free tortilla kind of dissolved. So use fat free sour cream and use your fat grams for the cheese and tortillas. It's worth it!","Since there are so many reviews to this recipie, I do not know if this was mentioned. When I made mine and instead of the 4 quart casserole pan, I used two 9 inch cake pans. I am only cooking for two so I froze the other. This was so very good! My husband, a tex/mex food fan, loved it (he added his favorite hot sauce to it since he loves extra extra heat)! No alterations need to be added to this. The ingreidents weren't hard to find and very inexpensive. Preparation was so easy! I served it with tortilla chips, sour cream and salsa. It's a good weekend or Friday night dish.","HELPFUL TIPS AFTER MAKING THIS FOR YEARS: Halve the MEAT but used 3/4th a can of the olives, whole can diced tomatoes & entire can of chiles (can't cut too much out or you won't be able to stack your pie). Sometimes I add chopped red/green peppers and cut out onions. Eyeball the salsa (use enough to coat the meat) which I use instead of taco s. Don't be afraid to layer this with 2-3 tortillas starting at the SECOND layer b/c it makes it taste just perfect (like taco bell mexican pizza)! I sprinkle taco seasoning over the beef while it's cooking (awesome flavoring) but not necessary. It helps tremendously to let it simmer as long as it says because the ingred. start to stick together for a nicer consistency. Apply a THIN layer of refried beans on the bottom of each new tortilla (i submitted pic), THIN layer of meat, & buy extra mexican cheese b/c you tend to use a lot to layer perfectly! This made 3 thin layers of meat, cheese, refried beans w/just the right amount to add the last amount of meat on top & have enough refried beans to serve as a side (b/c you only use 1/4th of it). If you make the full amount, it freezes well, so you can use it for a quick meal! Update: I cook until edges of tortilla are not soft (almost crisp so never soggy) & people go nuts over this!","This recipe calls for a ""large skillet"". That is an understatement. If you add all of the ingredients to the skillet, you will require a skillet of about 18-inches in diameter or a ""rondo"" (sp?). Therefore, I did not add the refried beans to the pan. Instead, I layered them onto the tortillas first, then the cheese, (which the recipe calls for 9 ounces but isn't quite enough, you need more like 12). And, I still had 4 tortillas left over after I layered. She also stated that a 4-quart casserole dish would suffice. No way. An 11""X 15"" casserole pan is required to use all of the products. The recipe also stated that it serves 7. Seven what?? Giants?? I was able to get 12 servings from this recipe with leftovers. If you want more ""spice"" than what the recipe states it has, add some jalapeno flavored refried beans instead of the basic and use a HOT taco sauce. Overall, I'd say the author has a good recipe, but far from perfect.","I made this recipe last night for dinner and it came out great. I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x13 inch pan. I cooked green onions instead of regular onions with the meat, the kids tolerate green onions. Instead of olives I added an 8 oz. can of mushrooms. I used a 7 oz. can of green chilies, we like them a lot. I used 1 whole can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, we like them a lot also. I used 8 oz. of homemade salsa, I always have some on hand, instead of taco sauce. I did use 1 whole can of refried beans, and we did not think it was too beany as other reviewers said. I used cheese to our liking, probably much more than called for. It was excellent! Thanks Kathi for a great, fast recipe!","This is such a nice change from all the regular dinners I cook. It is very tasty. I am not a fan of refried beans but the mixture worked well. My daughter of 5 yrs kept asking ""mom, why haven't you made this before?"" We topped our mexican lasanga with lettuce, green and red peppers and sour cream. What a treat! I will be making this alot in the future, esspecially when I am looking for a way to spice up our dinner life.",This makes a huge batch!,"I'm only giving this one 4 stars because I modified it so heavily. With the mods it was a 5. Here's what I did. First I scaled it in half and used a 13 x 9 pan. I omitted the diced tomatoes and substituted 1/2 can tomato sauce since my kids aren't crazy about chunks of tomato. I subbed my own fresh salsa but I think it would be fine with something like Pace. I also squeezed in a bit of La Victoria red taco sauce for flavor. I seasoned the meat mixture with 1 Tbsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. garlic powder, salt and lots of fresh ground pepper. I used the whole can of green chiles (undrained). I didn't mix in the refried beans or olives. I sprayed the 13 x 9 pan with cooking spray and then put a very thin layer of meat mixture in the bottom of the pan. Then I spread refried beans on 2 tortillas and placed them bean side down on top of the meat (overlapped they covered the bottom of the pan perfectly), more meat, cheese, olives. I repeated this layer one more time ending with meat, cheese and olives on top. I covered with foil and baked for 40 minutes. Removed foil, topped with a bit more cheese and baked another 5 minutes. It was REALLY good! The main problem I heard from the previous reviewers was that the flour tortillas ended up soggy. I believe this is because as written there is too much filling and it is too liquidy. My tortillas were not the least bit soggy. I will definitely make again with these mods.","Delicous! I followed the recipe exactly and found, as others said, it made a lot. I made two large pans full. We ate one and froze one. Recipe freezes very well! Both were delicious. I would recommend using more shells than the recipe calls for as well because it can get soggy.","This is a wonderful recipe. I have only 1 comment to add but I'm not sure if others have already mentioned it. I pan fried my tortillas (dry on a non-stick skillet) until they were lightly crispy. This helped decrease the sogginess significantly. Hope this helps, and thanks for the recipe and everyone's helpful comments!","This is my 13 year old's favorite meal and we have it all the time. I do use kidney beans instead of refried bean, add a cup of frozen corn. I use taco seasoning and two cups of water. If you let it simmer long enough the water and seasoning cook right in. You do want some liquid in the filling because it absorbs into the tortillas. This is a huge recipe. I sometimes split it and freeze one of the dishes in a disposable metal pan. Cooks great from frozen. 90 minutes at 325 - uncovered the last half hour. Enjoy!",This was pretty good. I think it lacks slightly in flavor. Next time I will add 1 tsp. cinnamon to give a richer flavor. My husband really enjoyed this so I'll be making this again!!!,"This recipe was delicious! The only change I would make next time would be to spice it up a bit with some jalapenos. Otherwise it was great. It reminded us of our favorite food in college-burrito enchilada style-from a restaraunt that is not located in our hometown so it is nice to know we can duplicate it at home now!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, looking forward to making it again soon!","Great recipe, but my family liked it much better with corn tortillas. The flour tortillas just seem gummy compared to the corn, and the corn adds a great flavor dimension. Followed other's suggestions and this is a winner!","I just made this recipe! It was great. Based on the prior reviews, I made a few changes: *used a pack of taco seasoning to flavor ground beer (no onion/garlic) *Mixed chunky salsa, corn, and diced green chilis in w/seasoned beef (I would prefer jalaps, but dh is a little wimpy when it comes to hot stuff) *used a round casserole dish to layer, starting w/salsa, tortilla, meat, cheese, tortilla spread w/refried beans, etc *halved the recipe and it fit perfectly in the casserole....could feed 4-8 depending on hunger and sides *served w/sour cream I'm always trying to eat healthier, so I used 97% lean ground beef, fat free refried beans, 2% cheese, and fat free sour cream and it was still very tasty!",my family loved this!! i also substitute the black beans for the refried beans and i also added a can of corn. also when i browned the beef i added the onion and green pepper along with garlic and some ground cumin. really added some extra flavor. this is a keeper. thanks,"This recipe ROCKS! Definitely top 10. I make it at least twice a month & everyone loves it. I've passed the recipe on to quite a few people as well, and they love it! I only make a couple of minor changes, it's excellent as is.... but I add some jalapenos to turn up the heat & I also use a jar of salsa instead of taco sauce. I use refried beans with chiles, and I season my beef with 1 envelope of taco seasoning, but I dont add water. Thanks for a great dinner, and thanks for all the compliments!","This was soooo goood! And it is one of those perfect pot luck dishes or any other time you have to feed a lot of people or prepare a meal in advance! Very convenient and very filling. There is so much flavor in this pie, you really need no other garnish but we did top it with sour cream and avocado slices and served it with tortilla chips. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves burritos. Yummy!!!! this is a definite keeper. Thanks.",Great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

49,"Hello! I am the submitter of this great recipes. I'm amazed at the wonderful reviews, but wonder why some have so much trouble with the sauce. The sauce is not to be poured over the pasta. It's supposed to be added and then mixed to the pasta. Therefore, it absorbs into the pasta and is never too thin or runny.","Delicious - hearty and satisfying. We used turkey italian sausage and fat free half and half to cut down on the fat, and 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes. I also added about 5 oz. frozen chopped spinach (thawed) to boost nutrition and flavor. My whole family loved it!","This dish is fantastic and you don't have to change a thing. Just make sure before you serve it, you mix the pasta with the sauce - that is the key. I do have to comment about the last posting. Don't criticize the recipe when you don't use the ingredients that are called for. The person said the recipe was bland, but used turkey sausage and didn't use the Italian tomatoes - of course it is lacking some taste. If you have to substitute that's fine - but then don't criticize the recipe. You didn't make it like it was intended to be made.","This had a great flavor, and my husband really enjoyed it. However, the recipe does not say to drain the grease before adding the cream. I didn't, and it turned out really greasy--as well as a strange orange color :-). I will definately drain the grease next time. I am also going to substitute ground italian sausage. The links didn't provide a unique-enough texture for all the trouble I went to. Other than that, I would highly recommend it!","Hmmm...one problem with this recipe. Made large batch for Mr P last night so he could heat up the leftovers this evening as I'll be working late. Trouble is, he liked it so much that he scoffed most of it in one go - so he'll be on very slim rations indeed! Made exactly as per recipe, only substituting spicy Italian sausage for sweet and basil for parsley as that's what I had to hand. Extremely tasty and presents well - would definitely serve to guests (if Himself doesn't neck the lot first). Thanks for a very quick, easy and delicious recipe.","This dish was SO good and really easy to make. I used penne instead of the bow tie pasta and I took the advice of other reviewers and used canned Italian style diced tomatos. That saved me from a lot of chopping. Instead of heavy cream, I used half and half and used corn starch to thicken up the sauce. This made the dish a bit healthier. Since my husband loves spicy food, I used Spicy Italian Sausage and still added the crushed red pepper. When my husband ate it, he was kidding around and asking me which restaurant I purchased this from. I will definitely make this again!!!","EXCELLENT DISH!! I used only 1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes and then added 1/2 tsp dried Italian seasoning to the tomatoes before adding them to the mixture. In addition, while sauting the onions and garlic, I added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper (maybe next time I'll add a whole one) for color and more texture. It was wonderful. Although all the adults found it to be the perfect amt of spice, my daughter thought it to be on the hot side. So for her sake, I may reduce the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. I can't wait to pass on the recipe!","This was awesome. Made this two nights ago and my husband is still commenting on how much he loved. I made exactly as written except substituted fat free half and half for about 1/2 of the cream...just to cut down on fat. Next time I make I will omit the oil...don't believe it is necessary as the italian sausage made enough on its own. Also, I used the sweet (mild) italian sausage and it was plenty spicy. Thanks for the terrific recipe! Made this in no time at all! 5/19/08 Made again tonight. Used all fat free half and half. Also omitted the oil. It was absolutely, without doubt, just as great, without lots of the fat!",I loved this!!! I used fresh red and yellow Campari tomatoes instead of canned - I cut them on a cutting board and saved the juice and added it to the sauce as well. I also added red and orange bell peppers and fresh basil and hot sausage instead of sweet. It was amazing - I will use this again for sure!!,"I made a number of substitutions based on ingredients I had around the house: penne rigate for the pasta, a combo of cream, half & half and 1% milk for the cream, ground red pepper (1/8-1/4 t.) for the red pepper flakes, and crushed Italian tomatoes for the whole tomatoes. It was delicious -- a very flexible recipe!","Nice easy mix of ingredients for the beginning cook as you really can't go wrong with this recipe.... The first time I made this, the recipe was rather mild, the second time I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, and Italian tomatoes with basil and garlic and it definitely provided more flavor. If you cannot handle spicy foods, this recipe is for you. Enjoy!","Delicious recipe and my clan loved it! I used penne pasta, Del-Monte zesty diced tomatoes with mild chile peppers and substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream. Trust me, you don't miss the fat at all!",You know you have cooked a good meal when you catch your 10 yr old daughter licking her plate before putting it in the sink. This dish was hands down one of my favorite recipes ever cooking from this site (and I am here constantly). I made it as is except I forgot to put the olive oil in the skillet and I used petite diced tomatoes. This is SUPER easy and SOOO good. Who needs to go to restaurants when we have as good of recipes as this to put out for your family??,"Another keeper from Allrecipes! Hubby raved over this one too - which is always a triumph. Since I was using a 16 oz. bag of bowties (aren't most pastas sold this way? yet the recipe calls for 12 oz.) I upped the sausage to 1 1/2 lbs. (to please carnivore husband) and increased the cream to 2 cups. I have been making cream sauces like this for years, and you can sub. half and half or light cream for the heavy cream and cut calories and fat, but no difference in taste. I did 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup half and half. Oh another tip - drain the sausage after browning it, before adding the onions and garlic. Your sauce will be greasy if you don't do this. And yes, your sauce will not be white, it will be some type of hue ranging from pink to orange, due to the tomatoes and sausage. Some reviewers seemed surprised by that. Also, I omitted the pepper flakes altogether and didn't miss it. Took another reviewers advice and used 1 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of 28 oz. plum can called for. Saves you all that chopping! For you busy moms of young children, this is also a recipe you can make ahead of time. I browned the sausage and made the sauce while my little one napped, and let it sit. Then closer to dinnertime, all I had to do was cook the pasta, and let the sauce come to a simmer again (and I added a bit of cornstarch in water to get it to thicken up). Toss together, top with shaved locatelli or parmesan, and Mangia Mangia!","Delicious! I used penne pasta and instead of heavy cream I opted for half and half and thickened it up with cornstarch. I added chopped red and yellow pepper for a little extra flavor and to make it a little healthier. Like others, I also used already seasoned chopped tomatoes. This was a very easy one dish meal to prepare.","I love this recipe, and it's quickly become a favorite in my household. I never make any changes, though the next time I make it I'm planning on using half & half and turkey sausage, to try and cut down on some of the fat. But as is, it's amazing! And on that note... I wish people wouldn't review a recipe negatively and then list all the changes they've made. You're not reviewing the original recipe, you're reviewing something you've created yourself. It's not very helpful.","Very easy, very quick and delicious for a quick weeknight dinner. I didn't use heavy cream. I used light cream and only about 3/4 cup. It was a hit my husband and sons. Will definitely become a regular dish at our house!","One of the best, most memorable recipes I've ever made. I use hot Italian sausage because we like spicy and cream cheese since I almost never have heavy cream in the house. Very forgiving and adaptable. Sometimes make this with fresh broccoli florets blanched with the boiling pasta for a few minutes to give a bit more green vegetable and make a one dish meal. Leftovers freeze beautifully for lunches at work. Heat this in your office microwave and you will draw a crowd asking what smells so good.",Made as directed while wondering where the flavor was supposed to come from. Wondering led to reality. This is flavorless without adding basil or oregano or something. Zzzzzz on flavor.,This recipe makes ALOT! If you have only 3 people eating trust me and 1/2 the recipe. It is delishous and the only thing I added or changed was green bell peppers. This is a great dish!,This was good but I would like to have had a thicker sauce but otherwise we will make this again thanks for the recipe,"this is an awesome recipe. I also substituted FF half&half for the cream & once you mix the sauce with the bowtie pasta, the consistency is perfect! It looks too thin while it's still simmering, so don't be fooled! I will make this for guests for sure! I also sprinkled fresh basil over instead of parsley. YUMMY!","I've finally been cooking long enough that I can spot a likely winner just by reading the recipe. This is a keeper. I only did two things differently. First, I did not put oil in the pan because I knew the sausage had enough fat not to need it, even in stainless; I just preheated the pan really well. Second, I used half and half instead of cream and that worked well. And I had time to let it simmer several minutes longer. Just super. Thank you!","Made this last night for supper. After reading other reviews I used penne pasta, a 28oz can of diced tomatoes drained, chopped spinach(omitted the parsley) and a shallot instead of onion. Since my canned tomatoes wasnt seasoned I added italian seasoning. I had less than a cup of heavy cream so used 1/2 & 1/2 for the rest. This was easy and delicious on a cold winters night. Great base recipe to make per taste. The next time I may use pancetta, olives and artichoke and just omit the sausage. Thanks!",Addictive! I added mushrooms and used the gnocci -shaped pasta. An outstanding recipe.,"I made this with some changes based on what I had at home. I only had a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes so I used 2 diced fresh tomatoes to make up for the lack of canned. I used half & half instead of heavy cream and I used a package of cheese tortellini. I thought it was good but not great. My son thought it was terrific. I settled on 4 stars because I would have given it 3 and he would have given it a 5! I think some Spinach would have been a good addition - or maybe some fresh mushrooms sauteed would have been good too. Either way, I'll probably make it again. Thanks for a good one!",I have had this exact recipe for years with the exception that I use fresh basil in place of the parsley and I also top with fresh grated parmesan. I cannot tell you how many times I have wrote this recipe out for friends after serving it. It is always a hit!,,,,,,,,,

51,"These were really good. I made six small patties out of this. I didn't use sherry, but thought that the taste was stil excellent. I did dip each of my patties in flour on both sides before putting them into the frying pan. Finally, after I added my flour and beef broth to the onions, I added 1.5 cups of milk and let it come to a boil. Then I mixed 2T of flour with 1/2 cup of milk and slowly poured it into the broth mix. Once it was thickened, I returned the ""steaks"" to the gravy mixture. They tasted wonderful like this!","I'm always so nervous trying dishes without reviews! But I just thought this sounded good. And it IS good, so that was a relief. I didn't have sherry, but I looked up a substitution chart and it said I could use orange juice or pineapple juice. But I didn't have those either! So I looked up aNOTHER chart and it told me I could use vanilla extract! So I did (one tsp for the one tbsp sherry). And the gravy just smelled so good. And thickened up wonderfully. All in all, a great, easy dish. Just serve over rice! :)","After we travel, Hubs and I crave an old-fashioned, comfort food dinner. I was on a plane at 37,000 ft. when I came across this recipe and couldn’t wait to get home to make it. I agree with Lisa completely, that this is reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV dinner, those with the aluminum trays, designed before the advent of microwave ovens. When I was a young girl, I remember a rare treat was to accompany Mom to the grocery store and choose a TV dinner. My favorite was Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and corn (the deluxe version included a really awful brownie). This is what we craved, and this is what I attempted to recreate tonight with this recipe. In other words, I had no illusions that it would taste like anything else, and I was not disappointed. In keeping with that memory, I used cornstarch rather than flour for the gravy, as I remember those TV dinners having a translucent gravy. I cooked the heck out of the onions, until they were nearly caramelized - sweet, soft and so good. I cooked them separately, removed them from the pan, then fried up the hamburger patties. I tried making 8 of them as the recipe directed, but that was just too skimpy for me, so I made 6. I seasoned them following the recipe exactly – I wanted these simple, the kind of meal I recall growing up – nothing fancy, just delicious and satisfying. Since I served this with mashed potatoes (and corn of course!) I doubled the gravy (with no salt) and was pleased I did. We cleaned our plates.","This doesn't apply to this recipe specifically, but I am sick and tired of reading bad reviews from people who haven't even tried the recipe. Every cook tweaks a recipe a bit, but to give it a bad review? Too much time on their hands. Let's see some of THEIR recipes!","this recipe is excellent as is. Please, people....review the recipe as it is, and rate it as it is!! Adding or changing the ingredients alters the recipe, and therefore is not a true rating of the original recipe.","We loved this recipe, thanks! I used French Onion soup instead of the beef broth, and would highly recommend using ground Angus for the beef. The flavor is wonderful, thanks!","Good recipe, but using fresh herbs and spices really helps...fresh grated garlic, minced onions or grated onion, fresh cracked pepper etc. really makes a big difference...a little chopped parsley also adds something.","This was VERY yummy!!! As always, I made the recipe EXACTLY as it is and I have to say I owuldn't change a thing.",These were great! I decided to follow another user's directions and add a splash of red wine vinegar (in place of the sherry that I didn't have) and it pretty much ruined the gravy beyond belief. Don't use vinegar! I luckily had an instant brown gravy mix that I whipped up last minute. Thank God you have to remove the meat or else it would have been ruined too! The way I saved it was great and I ate it on top of white rice.,"We just loved this! I did double the gravy and used a can of onion soup, mmmm mmmm good! I used rice but next time I make this I will make it with mashed potatoes, this is the best gravy! hum!","Thanks, Anne, for a wonderful recipe. It is definitely a keeper. As others have suggested, do double the gravy. My husband did the cooking outside in an electric skillet. Couldn't have been better!","Added couple cloves fresh garlic & half box of fresh mushrooms--threw them in food processor with the onion so they would mix with the meat better. Instead of beef broth used half a large container of mushroom broth and small container of french onion soup(not dry mix) to make the gravy. Then added rest of mushrooms and a sliced onion, put the lid on and let the whole thing simmer. Adding some sour cream to gravy just before serving with noodles makes is good too. I buy the mushroom broth and the French onion soup at the health food store or in health food section of grocery. Most of my family are addicted to mushrooms so the broth is used in everything but dessert.","5 stars all the way! I used ground turkey instead of beef. Didn't have onion or garlic powders, so I used the real stuff :) My husband didn't expect to like it (his words!) from the recipe pic, but went back for seconds and said he would like this on a regular basis! My kids tore it up :)","This is one of the best recipes I've made off this site! It was so good that really no changes were needed to make it family pleasing. The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender, and it was really easy to make. The only changes I made were to fry the patties in nonstick cooking spray instead of all the oil (the meat was greasy enough that this worked really well!) and I also skipped the sherry, only because I never keep that in my house. Every single person in my family liked this dish, and that is saying a lot!!!! They were even requesting that I make it again this week...which I might do! I served these over noodles, and it was a cheap, tasty, family-friendly meal that I will make again and again. Thanks so much for sharing...this is a winner!!!","This popped up yesterday as the Recipe of the Day as I pulled up the site in the hopes of looking for a new turkey cutlet recipe...needless to say I made this instead! Soo happy I did! This recipe is a great way to use chop meat in a not so boring way and the ingredients are things we all have in our pantry, pretty much. The only 2 substitutions I made were soy sauce for the worcestershire and marsala cooking wine for the sherry as I did not have those 2 in the house. I did double the gravy mixture...doubled the flour, beef broth, and marsala to make more of the gravy as I knew my family would want to smother the rice with it. Always love extra gravy and it tasted fabulous so I was sooo happy I doubled it. This is def a keeper for my house! Nice way to make something different with chop meat, had the feel of salisbury steaks, deeeeelishh!!",Wonderful,"Excellent!! The gravy this produces (which I doubled) is good enough to eat alone in a bowl! I couldn't stop sneaking spoonfulls of this gravy! The only thing I will add is that even though I tripled the amt. of everything for the gravy (ie, 3 cups of broth) it was still a bit thick. I made a note to quadruple the broth next time, to thin it out just a bit. I served this over oven-roasted potatoes, and it was just divine. Also, as a note, I did not have beef broth, so I made homemade broth w/ ONION SOUP MIX, which makes a lovely, savory broth w/ onion flavor! I highly recommend this route...it adds even more delicious flavor! Try it..I think you will be delighted with the taste it produces! Thank you, and am planning on making this for visiting relatives in a couple of weeks, as it has now become one of my all-time favorite recipes!","This is a very good recipe. As with all of the recipes from this site, I make it as written; that way I rate the recipe submitted...not the one I made and have to take responsibility for the outcome! I was out of ground chuck so I used ground Buffalo. The low fat content of the meat and deep flavor worked very nice with the gravy. Served it with mashed potato's and green beans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"After reading the reviews I did the following - I bought 4 lb pork butt - a less expensive cut of meat. I put the meat and broth in the slow cooker for 10 hours, shredded it right away (it shredded very easily) added 1 1/2 bottles of barbecue sauce and refrigerated it overnight. The next day I put it back in the slow cooker for a couple of hours to reheat. It was delicious, easy and inexpensive.","This is how I cook my bbq pork. Recommendation for those who have used pork tenderloin, boneless pork chops, etc., - you're using an expensive cut of meat when the cheap cuts work as well. Honestly, the pork will be very tender and the flavor rich. It only takes a small amount of work to remove the bones & fat. The meat itself remains reasonably lean. You will save much money by trying the pork butt, pork roast, etc.","The way i made this turned out excellent! I used approximately 5.5 lbs of pork ribs with the bone since i coulldn't find boneless. I made my own sauce from a Taste Of Home recipe i have for pork ribs. Plain bottled sauce seemed like it wouldn't taste good. The recipe i used for the sauce is: 1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup chili sauce 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 tbsp chopped onions 1 tbsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp ground mustard 1 clove garlic, minced dash cayenne pepper Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.","Here's a really good modification of this recipe. Throw your pork in a slow cooker with no liquid (or maybe a little water if it's a really lean cut) and cook until it's done. Then shred it and pour in a bottle of good vinegary barbeque sauce and most of a can of cola, and leave the top off the slow cooker (should still be at high) for about an hour to thicken the sauce. This takes out the oven step, and the soda in it is surprisingly delicious. Of course it smells so good I can hardly wait that last hour, so I sometimes speed things up in a big skillet. Enjoy!",I used a 16oz can of BEER instead of beef broth....it was awesome. I used Cattlemans Smokehouse BBQ sauce..the best! My husband said it was the best BBQ pulled pork he'd ever had!!,"Really, really good. Again, I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make it and this time I was glad I had. I was very tempted, like others, to just throw the sauced meat back into the crock pot--I mean, why mess up another pan, right? Well I think it made a big, positive difference to the final product. The time in the oven kindof browns the tips and makes it seem more like meat done on the grill. I'd never used Sweet Baby Ray's before and it was good with the pork. It was a little sweet, obviously--I may use Bullseye next time for a more savory change of pace. I will definately be making this again.","Wow this BBQ was a huge hit. Following the advice of my butcher I used Boston Butt instead of boneless ribs. I cooked the meat for 8 hours the night before the party, drained and shredded it and stored it back in the crockpot overnight in the fridge. About 4 hours before the event I added the Sweet Baby Ray's (don't settle for kc masterpiece - yuck) and some of the left over stock drained from the crock the night before. So amazing, I will be making this again!","I followed the advice of another review and cooked the pork for 10 hours, pulled it and drained the broth, and then let the pork marinate in the BBQ sauce over night and reheated it the next day. I would suggest the beginning part (cook the pork in the broth for about 10 hours and then pull the pork/drain the broth) but then I would mix the BBQ sauce right in and just warm it up....then eat it. By marinating it over night and reheating it the pork became mush and there was hardly any texture. I am a big texture person, so it was hard to eat that way. I would rather have bigger chunks of pork than mush. Otherwise, this was amazing, especially with the original Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. I would highly suggest making this and we will be making it again!","This recipe is impossible to screw up...also, everyone we've tried this (about ten times)on loves it. After experimenting a bit, we've settled on the following: pepper then brown pork (shoulder or butt cut) chop med - large onion, put in bottom of slow cooker with browned meet on top, then pour on 1/2-3/4 bottle of smoke/bbq sauce, cook for 8-10 hours, remove bone(s) and large pieces of fat, shred meat, put back in the cooker, mix with the leftover bbq sauce then switch to high for 1/2-1 hr. serve on rolls with beer","I used this recipe and the ideas of Jan's (submitted Feb.2001). It was absolutely delicious! Used a boneless shoulder cut of pork since it tends to be leaner. Peppered and seasoned pork using Lawry's seasoning, browned the meat. Chopped med onion added to bottom of slow cooker. Added one can of beef broth and 1/2cup of your favorite BBQ Sauce (a good sauce also makes the difference in taste, we prefer a sweet/spicy sauce)-cooked in slow cooker on low for 3-4 hours, until meat was tender and ready to fall apart. Drained broth, shredded the meat, mix rest of BBQ sauce, cooked to desired temp. approx 1/2-1 hour in cooker. This is definately a repeat recipe in our home for many years to come!","I made it the first time just as this recipe calls for and it was ok. I was expecting more than the bbq sauce having to give it the flavor, and plus my husband was not even interested in taking a 2nd sandwich. the second time i made it i used a 3 lb boston butt (pork shoulder) and rubbed it with 1tsp of each- seasoning salt, ground black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and sage. By the way sage goes great with pork! Then i put it in the crock pot with only 1 cup water. Didnt use beef broth because of the extra salt, water works just as perfect. let it cook on low 6-8 hrs until its fall apart perfect with a touch of the fork. take it out and let it sit for 10 minutes and discard the cooking liquids. Shred it up with 2 forks or your fingers. put it back in the crock pot, coat it with BBQ sauce (sweet baby rays :-)) and let it sit for 1 more hr on low. My husband will now eat half the pot!","Having made a variation of this many times, I can say that the step of cooking the meat in beef broth is unnecessary and though I did do that this time, I noticed no difference than had I not. I have always cooked the meat first with nothing added, shredded it, then returned it to the slow cooker with the BBQ sauce to cook another hour or so. I can also say that this is as good as the barbecue sauce used. In this case, I agree with hubs' comment that it was the ""Jim Neely's Interstate Barbecue Sauce"" we brought back from Memphis that made this so tasty.","Wow, this came out awesome. I used 2lbs of Pork Roast Butt. I did everything else nearly the same. I increased the time in the crock pot by 1/2 hr on low, in addition to the 4hrs on high. I also didn't have a cast iron skillet or pan so I put the pulled pork in a prepared with Pam casserole dish. My husband said it was the best pulled pork he ever had! He orders this all the time at restaurants and now said he doesn't like the restaurant ones nearly as much as this homemade version. He had it again for breakfast the next day! It was gone before you know it! He said he wants me to make this for him every week. It was so easy to make, the only thing that took any time was pulling the pork apart with forks. This was no effort and no time. I love this recipe and so does my husband. Thank you for posting it! UPDATE: I made this again several times, but this last time I used a beef chuck roast, 2lbs and WOW it was so good! We had friends over and they just died over how freakin good this is and how easy! I did nothing at all different! I just made sure that when I pulled apart the beef I got rid of as much of the fat as possible and it was super wonderful. Also, I used 3 different BBQ sauces, about 16ounces for 2 lbs each time I did this. The extra BBQ sauce is real important because when it goes in the oven for the last 30minutes (which you gotta do to get those brown tips, mmm) anyway, in the oven step, the heat from the oven sucks out some of the juices.","I love this two step method of cooking - the slow cooker makes it tender and the black skillet oven time enhances the texture and provides those delicious little ""burnt ends"" that we all love. A good tip: after removing the meat from the slow cooker and pulling it and blending it with the sauce, I add about 1/4 c of the juices from the cooker to the meat before turning it into the skillet (which I already have hot by warming in the oven during the pre-heat.) This aids the charring and caramelizing while helping to keep the bulk of the meat juicy tender. Taste is subject to your seasoning and sauce; for mine I use half Bull's Eye Original and half Moonlite BBQ (local specialty from Owensboro, KY) plus 3T molasses or brown sugar, and 1T Frank's hot sauce for a spicy-sweet flavor. I also add one whole sweet onion (sliced very thin) to the slow cooker pot before the meat goes in, plus 1/2 tsp liquid smoke to the beef broth/ beer / cola. No matter which cut of meat I've used, or which form of liquid, as long as I've stayed true to the method, I've ALWAYS produced a crowd pleaser with this recipe. Thank you KMB233 for sharing!","Super Good!!!! I used a pork butt instead of the ribs -- cheaper and just as good, as others have mentioned. I omitted the beef broth, as my butt had enough fat on it already *blushing*. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I used Sweet Baby Ray’s bbq sauce (my fave) and did the oven thingy. I think baking it in the oven for the last 30 minutes is a crucial step; it just gives it a wonderful texture so it’s not so soupy after slow cooking all day. I served over toasted hamburger buns, with a green salad on the side. Even my 17 year-old-daughter (who hates everything and everybody) loooved it :) I would definitely make this again.","This continues to be a family favorite - to the point where I gave both of my adult sons a cast iron skillet, a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, and the recipe typed on a card as an extra Christmas gift. It's delicious,and easy. Using a pork butt is the trick -- cheaper and meatier. One son prefers Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. I would suggest having the bottle at the table as well. I cook it for 10 hours on low and the meat shreds perfectly - comes out a bit chunky, which is what I prefer. The last 30 minutes in the oven is the trick -- the sauce sticks better to the pork. My mouth is watering as I'm typing this!","This was absolutely delicious! I used a 4 lb. pork butt which was less expensive and just as good. Seasoned the meat generously with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I then sliced one onion and put it under the meat with the beef broth. After 5 hours on high the meat shredded beautifully. I mixed 1 1/2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce into the pulled pork before putting it in the oven as directed for 20 minutes. Do not skip this step! The sauce caramelizes and becomes the perfect consistency. I served the pulled pork on potato roll buns with a side of baked beans. This was better than any pulled pork I've ever had before. I had a house full of happy guys.","The recipe I used for the sauce is: 1/2 cup cider vinegar --- 1/2 cup brown sugar --- 1/2 cup ketchup --- 1 tsp chili powder --- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce --- 2 tbsp chopped onions --- 1 tbsp lemon juice --- 1/2 tsp ground mustard (substitute with premade mustard) --- 1 clove garlic --- dash cayenne pepper. Threw sauce and pork ribs in slow cooker for 6 hours then I shredded the meat. Last of all, I made the drippings thicker by adding cornstarch after cooking the pork.","This recipe was amazing! My guests all went back for seconds, but I did make a few changes. I used 4 lbs. of pork shoulder, which I rubbed with a mix of the following: 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons Emeril's Essence seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt,1 tablespoon ground cumin,1 tablespoon paprika,1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper,1 tablespoon cayenne. I let it sit overnight, then cooked it on low for 9 hours with 1/2 can of beef broth. Then I strained the liquid, shredded the pork, removed the bones and fat, mixed in a bottle of bbq sauce, and then put it back in the slow cooker until warm. Served on potato rolls with cole slaw and corn and black bean salad.","I don't often use a crockpot, but this is one recipe that I will keep. It is perfect for days when you know that you will be late getting home and yet you still want to feed your famaily a good hearty meal. Just add a tossed salad on the side and maybe some corn and you're good to go. I make my own barbeque sauce in gallon quantities that I am partial to. Before I started making my own sauce, I found that Sweet Baby Ray's is one of the best on the market and am sure that it would definately do this recipe justice. Please don't ruin this recipe by using KC Masterpiece, you might as well throw in ketchup, mustard and brown sugar. Ick","This is incredible! I used 3 1/2 lb. of pork loin (because I had it in the freezer), and added an onion to the crock pot. I drained pot after 4 1/2 hours on high, shredded the meat and added a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, an extra 1/2 cup or so of a Chipotle Citrus bbq sauce and about 1/2 cup of the broth. I thought my boyfriend was going to explode he loved it so much! PERFECT food for football Saturday's!",I used a pork loin roast and it was awesome!,"I don't see how this could be much easier. I put the ribs in the crockpot on low and cooked them overnight. I used the beef broth, some chopped onion and 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke. This morning I drained the liquid, shredded the meat and then added the BBQ sauce. Put back in the clean crock pot and heated for 2 more hours. Delicious!!","This is fool proof. I loved it. I find that recipes like this are only as good as your BBQ sauce, and everyone has different opinions about how a BBQ sauce should be. Use your favorite sauce and you will love this recipe!","Great BBQ pork sandwiches! Easy, no fuss recipe. My whole family loved it! Marilee","I served this for my daughters 1st birthday party where there were over 20 people. It went over really well. I did change things a little bit. I used a 7lb pork roast ($1.98/lb) and put it in the slow cooker for about 10 hours or so. After that, I shredded it and added the bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Rays in my case) and put it in the fridge over night. The next day I put it all in a 13 x 9 and added more bbq and baked it at 400 for about 40 minutes. Then I served it in the crock to keep it warm. Turned out great, takes a bit of planning time-wise but is easy and very economical.","My husband has said my pulled pork could easily win contests. I buy 3 lbs pork shoulder and sprinkle jerk seasoning and french thyme very heavily on the shoulder as a rub and chop a medium white onion, throw that into the pot/partially on top of shoulder and pour 1.5 cups cola over the entire thing. set it on low to cook 8.5 hours, then cut the cord and hand pull the pork to a thick--medium consistency and return it to the crock pot, pour 2 cups sweet baby ray's bbq over everything and set it on high to cook 30-40 mins. serve on hamburger buns with twice baked potatoes and a bud lite and you've got yourself an amazing dinner, plus about 4 lunches and 2 more dinners worth of appetizers. that is if its just you and your hubby ;)",,,,,,,,,

54,"AWESOMELY GOOD! Ok I'm literally in the middle of making this but had to share my success. This has excellent taste! I have never tried to prepare eggplant although eggplant parmesan is my fav at the restaurant...not anymore! I'll make this at home healthier and cheaper! Taking several bits of advice from previous reviews this is how I did it. 1) Sweat the 1/4"" slices by sprinkling with sea salt and letting sit for 30 min. Rinse, pat dry w/paper towel (get good & dry) 2) Dip slices into beaten eggs and coat in gallon sized ziploc bag for easy cleaner breading. I used seasoned bread crumbs and tossed in about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. 3)Place on baking sheet coated with EVOO then bake for 7 min at 450, flip and bake add'l 5-7 mins depending on how crisp you like it (mine were nice a crisp @ 7 min per side) 4) At this point I am eating the slices as is with a fork and they are great! I will be placing them on angel hair pasta and covering with homemade sauce and cheese then baking just to melt it all together. It's wonderful! I plan to try freezing extra slices after they come out of the oven, but before mixing with anything for next time I get a craving!","This recipe is worthy of more than 5 stars. Baking the eggplant instead of frying does not take away from the flavor of the dish one bit. It does, however, need to bake longer than stated. I baked mine for about 20 minutes until it was lightly browned. Also, I chose to sweat the eggplant before breading by peeling, slicing, sprinkling with sea salt and placing in a collander in the sink for about 30 minutes. This pulls out any bitterness. Just be sure to rinse it well with water and pat dry with paper towels before breading. I did two layers of eggplant. You can layer however you like, you just to be sure the top layer of eggplant is topped with sauce and then cheese. This is my husband's favorite dish.","This dish turned out quite well - my boyfriend and I both want to make it again. However, 3 eggplants was way too much - next time I will use a good medium sized one and a smaller one. I salted each slice and let it sit for twenty minutes before rinsing in cold water, as per another suggestion, and then found that 2 1/2 cups of breads crumbs and two eggs sans yolks were plenty to cover all the eggplant slices. However, the slices definitely needed to be cooked a little longer than five minutes on a side - next time I might try cooking ten minutes a side. Over all, though, a good recipe!","Excellent! I scaled this down for 3 servings and ended up using 3 eggs as well as 2 cups of bread crumbs. I made my own ""italian"" version by adding garlic powder, oregano, 2 tbs parmesan, salt, pepper and paprika. I followed some of the reviewer's advice and baked the eggplant for 10 minutes on each side. I recommend everyone do this as the eggplant was just cooked. I also sliced the eggplant to 1/4 inch slices as we don't like them too thin. My husband gave this a 10 out of a 5 :-). For those of you whose eggplant sticks to the pan without oiling your baking sheet, try parchment paper. ITS EXCELLENT! You don't have to use anything to grease your pans and nothing sticks. You can also reuse it. Thanks so much for sharing!","Positively LOVE this! Have made it several times already. I DO salt the eggplant first, and dip slices in just egg whites only-- no need for the extra fat in the yolks; bake slices 10 min per side; I use healthy choice garlic lovers sauce. One medium eggplant and about 1/2 of a 26 oz jar of sauce seems to be a perfect amount for me and hubby with leftovers for another whole dinner. DELICIOUS!!","Recipe needed a little manipulation but it turned out so good. I added spinach and used Muir glen tomatos. My husband and preschooler loved it. I am giving this recipe 5 stars just because it is a great way to experiment and encourage you to try cooking with eggplant (wich is great and yummy). I read most of the reviews before starting out. The most common problems seemed to be the texture of the eggplant after cooking (undercooking) and the bitterness? (Not really an issue). So I sliced these very very Thinly, about a quarter of an inch. Salting eggplant to remove bitterness didn't make sense to me because salt will induce osmosis and draw out water which you need to keep the flesh plump. You do not want a withered eggplant. I did my own test and it seemed that the part between the skin and flesh was the most bitter? so I just peeled it more deeply and let it sit in fresh cold water for 15 minutes. The eggplant was not bitter at all. But I think that may also have to do with the variety of eggplant available to you. So try a different variety if your eggplant is really bitter. Finally after cooking my dish for 30 minutes the flesh was still chewy so I had to let it cook for an additional 30 minutes. At this point the eggplant had a great texture. So either the cooking temperature or the time frame was off. So other than these minor setbacks, The meal was really good, it was like an eggplant lasagna. Thanks for the recipe I will make it again.","First of all, jarred spaghetti sauce is a no-no in our house. It only takes a few minutes and a few ingredients to make a quick marinara sauce to pair with this dish. My tip for cooking the eggplant slices, is to skip breading, frying or baking entirely. Simply slice them, brush with EVOO and grill on both sides until lightly browned. You can use the gas grill or a ridged grill pan or indoor griddle. It really cuts down on the fat, carbs and calories and lets the eggplant, sauce and cheese be the stars. Breading the eggplant adds too much heaviness and masks the flavors, in my opinion. Also, this tip from Patricia Wells excellent Italian cookbook ""Trattoria"": Do not salt or peel the eggplant. Fresh eggplant should never be bitter and the peel imparts a rich, deep flavor.","Wonderful recipe! However, I did use some of the suggestions mentioned in some of the other reviews. I used 2 good sized eggplants instead of 3. To remove the bitterness, I salted the eggplant and let it sit for 20-30 minutes and then rinsed with cold water. And I baked it for 10 minutes on each side. Came out great. This recipe is a keeper!","This was a very good, easy and healthy version of this dish. I did salt my eggplant first for about 20 min, and let stand in colander in the sink..then rinsed it well w/ cold water - it takes the bitterness out of the eggplant. I used Italian breadcrumbs and added some garlic pepper to them. My family loved it, and no frying!!!!!",Delicious! I baked my eggplant for about 10 minutes without turning it over and then turned the oven off and let the eggplant sit for about 30 minutes in the warm oven. It came out perfect. Just don't forget to peel the eggplant.,"This recipe was excellent (just as good as frying!!!) and so much healthier, too. I par-boiled the eggplant slices (not sliced too thin or else they will not hold together)for about 1-2 minutes (no longer or else the slices will be too soft and fall apart)in salted, boiling water (in a large pan so water can circulate around the slices)before dipping and breading them. Drain well after rinsing in cold water. Let slices sit on paper towel to dry also. I find that this ""pre-cooking"" makes the eggplant nice and soft in the center instead of hard and /spongy. (It won't absorb half as much oil when frying it if you cook it that way instead of using this recipe.) I used Italian seaoned bread crumbs. I found that I needed about five or six eggs instead of two. I baked the breaded slices on cookie sheets coated with ""Pam"" in a pre-heated 375 degree oven for 10 minutes on each side side, too. This was time consuming, but, well worth it. I used an Italian blend of cheese instead of just mozzerella. I would say it serves 6.","Mine turned out amazing! All the family loved it and much better than any restaurant eggplant parm! A few modifications: 1. DO spinkle with salt before using as other reviewers have suggested. Rinse with cold water after 30min. 2. DO pat dry. 3. DIP each slice of eggplant in flour PRIOR to egg wash, then bread with PANKO breadcrumbs (these specialty crumbs are much crisper than regular crumbs). Mix 3 cups PANKO crumbs, 1 tsp pepper, 2 tsp salt, 1/2 grated parm or padano cheese and zest of 1 lemon. Use this as your breading, much more flavor. 3. Bake for 10 min @ 350 C, turn over and bake for another 10 min. Then bake at 400 C for 15-20 min until golden brown. 4. Layer with sauce and cheese. In middle layer add fresh basil finely chopped. Enjoy!","This is just little note for all you eggplant fans, there is a male and a female eggplant, and the female is more bitter and has more seeds. The way to tell is to look at the large end of the eggplant if the brown spot is elonged it is a male if it is completely round it is a female. Again the Male is less bitter.","WOW! I will never fry eggplant again. I love eggplant parm, but i never thought it could taste this good baked! I didnt change the original recipe too much. I used 2 small firm eggplants. (When buying eggplant i find the smaller firm ones have the sweetest taste..so even though you think you're getting more for your money by buying a large one, the small ones taste SO MUCH better! and then theres no need to spend extra on the expensive small japanese eggplants) I cut quarter inch slices, salted and weighed the eggplant, then dipped in the whites and then a mixture of italian bread crumbs, panko, and parmesean. I wiped some EVOO on a large baking pan, made a single layer, and sprayed them with a little PAM. Crank the oven up to 425 and baked them 10 minutes on each side. They came out so crispy and delicious! Then i layered a little bit of sauce right over the eggplant and topped with skim Mozz and finished it off by broiling it for just a few minutes until the cheese is brown and beautiful. Good enough to serve to guests! and half the calories of frying!","Loved this dish Another hint in pre-baking the slices. I put a cooling rack inside the baking sheet and put my slices on that, then I cooked them for a total of 10 minutes. They came out nice and crispy and no need to turn them over. I then followed the rest of the recipe as written.","FanfrakinTastic!! 100% Yummy! I do a lot of research so I can get the recipe right, ingr. aren't cheap! Anyhow, this is what I used & did: 1 med. eggplant: NO NEED TO SWEAT, peeled and thinly sliced, 3 eggs & 2 c plain breadcrumbs. I baked in Parchment lined Baking pan for about 7 min each side. I used shredded parm & shredded mozz about 1/2 c low moisture or each., basil, Garlic Powder, Italian Seasonings and Pepper to taste. 3/4 of a jar of Prego. One casserole dish made 4 nice size servings. My calories & gist came to more Protein: 34 per serving. Calories: 456 per serving, fat: 23 per serving, Carb: 69 per serving, Fiber: 11 per serving. Pre-sprayed a casserole with Pam and put a couple tablespoons of sauce just to wet the bottom, not drench, a little goes a long way! Then I placed the eggplant in a single layer in the casserole dish. Then I put a layer of Mozz and Parm cheeses and REPEATED with remaining amounts. I sprinkled the seasonings; Basil, Garlic Powder, Italian Seasonings and a touch of pepper all over the top and baked for 40 minutes, till it was golden brown. We absolutely love this recipe, it made a gorgeous Eggplant Parm that tasted high end! We ate it all up! I made it again & made 2 casserole dishes worth and froze one and we ate one. It freezes so well! Microwave to reheat at 50-60% power for 5 min. Yum!","I didn't give this a 1-star rating because ""Couldn't eat it"" would be unfair. BUT, I couldn’t give it more than 2 because the recipe is misnamed and misleading. This may be perfectly wonderful, but it is NOT ""Eggplant Parmesan"", it's an eggplant casserole. And that's fine, but eggplant parmesan is a very classic dish and calling this eggplant parmesan is like playing Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture and calling it Beethoven’s Fifth. Or suggesting carbonara sauce can be made without eggs! A wonderfully simple dish with three main ingredients: eggplant, LOTS of parmigiano reggiano cheese and “sugo” (gravy) or what we call spaghetti sauce, Eggplant Parmesan uses FRIED eggplant and is so loved because of the beautiful marriage of flavors between the eggplant and parmigiano reggiano cheese! When I make it (just like my Italian mother and grandmother, see the photos) I use the sugo that’s simmering on the stove, flavored by a roast, meatballs and sometimes sausage so there’s no need to add herbs or spices because the sauce imparts a flavor that you cannot get out of a jar. No breadcrumbs! No basil! And NO MOZZARELLA! Two last things: eggplant should always be sliced VERTICALLY for frying. Crosswise slices allow eggplant fibers to soak up the oil. And if you think Italians only use olive oil, think again. Eggplant should be fried in an oil that can withstand a high temperatures. Grapeseed oil is best, heated to about 330 degrees.",These were spectacular! I did not bake mine in the sauce and cheese because I wanted to have leftovers for my husband to pack for work the next day. I added the sauce and cheese in top of them after they were done in the oven. They were crispy and fantastic! I baked mine at 450 for 10 minutes per side and they were cooked perfectly. I also did the whole sprinkle them with salt and let them sit for 20 minutes bit that the other reviews said to do. My husband said they tasted even better the next day.,"There are so many variations of this wonderful recipe. I was in a hurry so I didn't even bother to bread the eggplant. I just cubed it and roasted it for about 20 minutes with some olive oil, red wine vinegar, Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. Then I topped it with tomato sauce and a little finely shredded mozzarella and heated it through. We had it with whole wheat pasta and a Greek Salad. Here is a tip for those of you with bitter eggplants: select small, young, slender eggplants because they contain fewer seeds (the seeds can make them bitter).","A great tasting, simple recipe that does indeed taste fried. As there aren't many ingredients, be sure to use high quality sauces and cheese. I've made this several times, and have two recommendations for folks who said the eggplant was too soggy: 1) Shake off as much of the egg mixture as possible; it should only be lightly coated 2) Before breading, slice eggplant slices very thin; sandwich between paper towels and stack plates on top of one another for at least 10 minutes This will dry out the eggplant a little and it will cook to be crispier. A warning though: this makes the recipe considerably more time consuming","THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!!!! I had not made Eggplant Parmesan in years and I had a taste for it the other day. I was ready to fry the eggplant until I found this recipe. The eggplant bakes perfectly and never gets mushy. I leave the skin on because I like the flavor. I also salt the eggplant first for about 1/2 hour the wash off to take the bitterness out. I also added herbs to the bread crumbs because I didn't have italian bread crumbs. In addition, I use the Ragu Meaty Sauce instead of the Marinara Sauce. I will definitely make this again.",Be sure to keep the layers thin so they get a nice crunch.,"This method is excellent and beats frying by a mile if it's done right. I never salt and drain the eggplant, never seems to matter. Flour, a lot more egg (whites) than recipe calls for, and seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs. Spray w/ Pam, bake 10 mins, flip them over and spray w/ Pam again. Crunchy without the oil! Proceed w/ recipe and you can't go wrong. Top with some dried hot pepper flakes if that's what you like, we do. Thanks!","I made this and thought it was very, very good. I followed other reviewers advice and put some salt on the cut eggplant to let it ""sweat"". I only used one eggplant, and one jar of sauce. I cooked the eggplant in the oven for 10 min. on each side, instead of 5, and it was just right. I chose Paul Newman's Tomato and Garlic sauce, and it was yummy. Overall, I liked this very much and I will definitely make this again.","WOW! This is one of my favorite dishes that my husbands Grandmother used to make & passed away with it in her head. I took the advice of Betty Crocker & looked for a ""male"" eggplant because they have fewer seeds (hence, they are less bitter). This is WONDERFUL! I cut it down to three servings (which is still a lot) because my husband doesn't eat this dish, but I get 3 meals & don't even have to share! Thank you VERY much Dolores, its awesome!","This is great....have been making it this way now for about a year, and I love the ""no fry"" thing!! As every good cook knows, you need to alter recipes a bit..I add more sauce (and cheese) than it calls for, and that softens the eggplant when it bakes...as far as it being brown..who cares!!!! The sauce makes it red, and the fat content is lower than frying!!! Fry or bake, they both end of tasting the same --- one is just lower in fat.....and.....it is GREAT!!!!!! There is NO WAY to mess this great recipe up!!!!","This is delicious and very easy! Baking is much less messy than frying and healthier. Use olive oil cooking spray or if you have one of those atomizer pumps for actual oil, really limits amount of oil needed. I followed the reviewer suggestions of soaking the 1/4 in slices in cold salty water then drying on towels before dipping in egg substitute and coating in bread crumbs. I upped oven setting to 400 and flipped them when they looked brown on bottom. Not exact, but that is cooking. Recipes are more guidelines than rules. My whole family loves this from my omnivore hubby to my picky 10 yr. old veggie hater. Even the 2 yr. old and 5 yr. Old!",,,,,,,,,
55,"I love these burgers. Let me tell you how to keep them from falling apart, though. First, you must rinse the black beans and dry them off before mashing them. Second, you must strain the onion, garlic and pepper mixture through a fine strainer to remove any excess water. Third, if you add 50% more bread crumbs, it will hold much better. Also, I freeze mine and grill them frozen. Doing this has keep my burgers intact and my mouth happy! Also, I always follow the spice/hot sauce measurments pretty well, and I do not find it too spicy at all, and I find black pepper to be spicy! Hope this helps with the loose burger issue.","Delicious and easy! I substituted red bell pepper for green and used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs. I reduced cumin to 1 tsp and used 2 eggs. Following the advice of others, I blended everything in the food processor, beginning with onions, peppers, and garlic, then oats, then eggs and spices, beans last. I chilled the mixture, then rolled (more like poured -- think thick muffin batter) onto waxed paper. I froze the burgers. To grill, I oiled some foil that I folded over burger. Perfect! My 13 yr old vegetarian daughter liked it better than store bought (me too!)","One of the best dishes I made this month! You can substitute or add corn kernels to the burgers for more texture and flavor, but not necessary! Tastes very healthy since I baked them in the oven - no oil! This recipe made 4 good size patties. We ate them all up and I immediately made another batch to have for lunches. I made a chipotle mayo dressing which was exactly the touch it needed! (Some mayo and a dash of ranch dressing in a blender with two or three canned chipotle peppers to taste. GO EASY, they are extremely spicy.)","If you love black beans, you'll love this recipe. My recommendation however, is to use whole-wheat Ritz crackers, instead of breadcrumbs. They add much more flavor. Also, with any recipe, I would fry one small pattie in some oil first to make sure that it will be to your taste in terms of seasoning before you cook the whole mixture.","Okay, these are awesome. I hate the price of the supermarket veggie burgers and these are even better! I made the recipe exactly as directed and it was perfect. I don't have a food processor so I used my Pampered Chef chopper to finely mince the veggies. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem getting the mixture to stick together—this may have been because I squeezed the excess water from the onions and peppers before adding them (I used pureed garlic). They formed up beautifully and didn't stick at all to a sprayed pan in the oven. I'm thinking of making a double batch, baking it, and freezing them once these first four patties are gone. They would be SO handy to have on hand for those nights you don't want to cook. I ate mine on the ""Tasty Buns"" recipe also found on this site. This recipe makes a large patty, which is the perfect size for the largish buns.","As written, this recipe is NOT 5 stars (hence my 3 star rating). I made this exactly as written and ended up with a veggie burger that was too wet to hold together in a patty and had an odd spice flavour (too much cumin and not enough salt). That being said, this recipe is a good base to add to- and that's what most people hear are giving their 5 star rating to. With the addition of: grated zucchini and carrot, salt, pepper, more breadcrumbs, and fresh parsley (and the decrease of cumin), these burgers are very, very good. This recipe is actually one that works well with just about any grain or legume added (wild rice, lentils, quinoa, green onions) so my recommendation is to think of the recipe as a base to build your own creation from.","Great recipe! Two eggs is the way to go, no falling apart and not dry. I used all ingredients but also used corn. I advise that you make sure to add salt and pepper and the spices to the bean mixture before adding eggs so you can adjust as needed.","Mmmmm-so good we decided to freeze the rest of the batch for an easy, reheat meal during the week. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup cooked brown rice with the breadcrumb step to give the burgers a little more fill and structure. This recipe had the meat eaters and vegetarians alike asking for seconds. One tip: put a little olive oil on your hands when shaping the patties to prevent sticking. (Also makes your cuticles nice and soft!)These are an instant classic with my frinds.","Fun to make! I have already made it twice in the past 3 weeks. I use eggbeaters instead of real eggs, and 1-1.5 eggs (1/4-3/8 cups) seems to form the perfect consistency. I also added cilantro and mushrooms for a nice added kick. Superb!","The first time I made these seemed like a disaster. The mix was runny and could not be formed into anything, it was almost like soup. I froze it and baked it nontheless and it turned into surprisingly FANTASTIC burrito filling. I am on try number 2 now (we are having burritos again tonight) and the mixture was perfect, so it must have been me!! This time, I soaked and cooked my own fresh black beans . . . that may be what made all the difference. Try this recipe, it´s delicious!!","This is DELICIOUS. I swear, it is wayyyy better than storebought! I don't have a grill, so I did things a bit differently than some of the other reviewers. I did let the beans dry a bit after rinsing them and tried to get most of the moisture out of the onion, red pepper, garlic and pinch of cilantro that I roughly pureed with my immersion blender. One can of beans wasn't enough, so after mixing everything together, I added half a can of organic refried black beans. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I added a half a cup of cooked short grain white rice and about 1/3 cup of flour. I greased some aluminum foil and baked them on each side for 10 mins as suggested. To crisp them up, I put them in a pan on the stove with a tad oil for a few minutes before serving. AWESOME served with a side of chipotle mayo.","These burgers are delicious! As others have said, you need to squeeze the excess water out of the pepper and onion mixture before adding it to the beans. Another tip: you can make these vegan by using ground flax seed instead of the egg. Whisk 1 tbsp ground flax seed with 3 tbsp water. Then mix in the spices like it says in the recipe. You'll get sort of a spicy paste. Mix this in with the beans and it will hold together perfectly! Honestly, when I made this recipe with egg some of the burgers cracked, but they came out perfect using flax seed.","I'm impressed! These are tasty and at a fraction of the cost of store purchased veggie burgers. I took the tips from another reviewer (Kelly) and rinsed the beans then dried them really well with paper towels. I put the onion, garlic and green pepper through a mini food processor, then drained the excess liquid off and blotted with another paper towel. I mixed the mashed beans with the onion, garlic and green pepper. I added two egg yolks, omitting the whites because that just adds more water. I then added 1 cup of fresh bread crumbs with the remaining spices. Mine made 5 huge patties and I grilled them on foil lightly brushed with Extra Virgin Olive Oil. They came out perfect and I did not have any trouble with them falling apart. The second time I made these I added some worcestershire sauce and a small amount of liquid smoke. Wow, did that kick up the flavor. Even my meat lover husband thought they tasted great. At first I thought they would take a lot of time to make but I was surprised at how quick I made them. I will make up a bunch of these and freeze them. I have eaten just about every brand of store veggie burger that's out there. These are far superior to any of the store burgers. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!","These were superb! I didn't have any onion so I used onion powder instead. To make up for the dryness of the powder I added a tablespoon of salsa. They turned out really well! Grilled them for 5 minutes on each side- really yummy! Will make again! UPDATE: I have now made this again and have simplified the process. I just throw the beans, the roughly chopped pepper, onion and garlic into a bowl and blend with my stick blender until quite smooth. Then I just mix in the seasoning in the same bowl, add the egg and the breadcrumbs and stir. Then I let it stand for about 10 min so that the breadcrumb have time to actually soak up the excessive moisture. So easy and yummy! Will make now every week...","While these burgers don't quite have the same 'mouthfeel' as store-bought veggie burgers, these are so much better (not to mention cheaper) because YOU control the ingredients. A few tricks to keep the patties together ~ as a few reviewers have mentioned, make sure the beans are dry; even though the directions call for mashing the beans until thick and pasty, I've had better success when the beans are roughly smashed; briefly saute the chopped veggies to rid of excess moisture before adding to the beans; using only the egg white will help bind the patties together without increasing the amount of bread crumbs ~ hope that helps. And thanks, LAURENMU, for the delicious post!","I have never commented on a recipe but I really felt I needed to on this one. I have made these burgers 2 times. The first time they were great.. the second time they were AMAZING!! and the difference?? I put the beans, garlic, peppers, and onion in a blender and made a puree out of it, which of course made it more watery and I thought I had messed it up.. So I added bread crumbs until it was thick (about 1.5 more cups) added another egg (I did this both times) and then froze them, shaking my head at botching a good thing (although, now with all the breadcrumbs, I got 8 burgers out of one can). About 1.5 hours later I took them out, apologizing to my other half who had begged for them that night, put a little olive oil in a stir fry pan and cooked them on the stove. Oh my god - they were absolutely amazing!! the blender took away the weird bean-y texture that they had the first time. Absolutely amazing. I can't wait to eat the rest of them - they are in the rotation","i just made these for the first time and they were wonderful. i was really surprised but they held together perfectly! i rinsed the black beans, drained them, then spread them out on the baking sheet to dry while i prepared the rest of the ingredients. i also squeezed the water out of the onions, garlic, and bell pepper as best as i could with a paper towel. instead of the breadcrumbs i used 1 1/2 cups of quick oats, which made the burgers very dense (they could easily be a substitute for a beef patty this way). this is definitely one of my new weekly recipes- i'm a vegetarian and these provide tons of protein, fiber, nutrients, and carbohydrates in a quick, cheap, easy meal. next time i make this recipe i will probably add 1/2 a cup of each carrots, mushrooms, and perhaps soybeans, reduce the oats to 1 cup, add 2 tablespoons of flaxseed, make 6 servings instead of 4, and reduce the chili powder to 2 teaspoons. i should also mention that i plugged this recipe into the calorie-count.com recipe analyzer and the numbers are extremely different than the values on this site, so for the health conscious i would double check. either way this is a delicious, wonderful recipe!!","My husband and I are vegan, so I doubled the recipe and substituted 1 Flax Egg and 1 Chia Egg for the traditional eggs. To do this mix 1 Tbsp. Flax meal with 3 Tbsp water and set aside, and mix 1 Tbsp. Chia Seeds with 3 Tbsp water and side aside. Then combine with other ingredients as written. We found that this eliminated the excessive moisture that some had trouble with. Great recipe! Thank you!!!","I am a meat-eater who eats vegetarian during Lent. I used to be a terribly picky eater and even 5 years ago I never would have tried something like this. But I sure am glad that I did! After trying the recipe as is(very good),I did decide to make a few of my own modifications. I cooked my own black beans,drained and rinsed them when I was done. I cooked 1/4c.(dry)bulgur in 1/2c.water and 1/2t.vegetable base and used this in place of bread crumbs. I also used red pepper instead of green,1/2 of a jalapeno(no seeds),1/2c. mushrooms,1 ripe avocado(this adds a little healthy fat and gives the burger some moisture), and 2T tomato paste in addition to the ingredients listed. I chopped all of the vegetables to about a minced texture in my Zyliss, which gave it a ground beef-like texture. I drained these in a colander lined with paper towels(along with the fork-mashed black beans and bulgur)and gently pushed down on the ingredients to force out a little more excess moisture so they would hold together. I whisked together the egg,chili powder,and cumin and also added 1/8t.liquid smoke,1/4t.oregano,and 1/2t.vegetable base to this. I then poured the egg mixture over it all and used my hands to thoroughly combine all of the ingredients;as I mentioned earlier,it resembled the texture of ground beef. The patties formed very nicely,but I do recommend freezing them or they may fall apart when cooking. Cook in a non-stick skillet,but use a little butter or olive oil. 4* as is,5* this way.","This is a fantastic, basic veggie burger! I have followed the recipe with great results, but also love the versatility! I tend to double the recipe, use red peppers instead of green, use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and add a can of corn. It's also good with other veggies mixed in! The amount of breadcrumbs you use will depend on how watery your ingredients are - be sure to have more on hand, if necessary! You can substitute the egg for ground flax-seed mixed with water to make these vegan! Enjoy!",It's not vegan if it contains egg.,"I am a chef at a sorority. I make these for my girls all the time, they live them. I add different ingredients each time with different spices to keep it fresh. Why would you strain the veggies, losing all those great flavors, add some dried french onions instead of bread crumbs!!! Mix up a Chipotle ranch mayo for these with some cheddar cheese. Make a Greek veggie burger with spinach and feta cheese and Greek seasonings, ad a cucumber sauce for extra flavor. Make the patties up and freeze for a short bit, that will ensure a perfect patty!","With a few minor tweaks, this recipe is so good!! I have made this 3 times so far, each time with a few changes. I definitely agree the cumin is too much. I reduced it to 1 tsp and it seems perfect. Second, I make the whole thing in the food processor, because I'm just that lazy. I like the red bell pepper better than green in this recipe, or a mixture of both will probably be in my next batch. So I start by processing the pepper and onion in the food processor until finely chopped. I saute them with a small amount of olive oil in a non-stick pan for 2 minutes over medium heat. Meanwhile I process the garlic until it is nicely minced. Add that to the pan and saute one minute more, or until fragrant then remove from heat. I add the beans to the processor with the veggies, egg and spices, and process until blended. Then add the bread crumbs (3/4 cup as per others) and give it a few pulses. Then comes the most important part: put in a covered bowl and refrigerate at least 20 minutes. No more falling apart. I sauteed mine in a bit of olive oil for about 5 minutes each side in a non-stick pan. Topped with avocados, as others suggested. Basked in the raves. Thanks for the recipe!","Made these yesterday, was pleasantly surprised at how great they were! I didn't have a perpper, so I subbed half a grated carrot. Also, I used an extra egg and refrigerated the mixture for about an hour. No problems with it falling apart. Very happy with my first home-made garden burger attempt. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","I'm a vegetarian and decided to give this recipe a try. I made it pretty much the way that it says except that I added soy sauce and worchester sauce instead of chili powder and hot sauce. That way I can spice it to taste later, especially since my 7yo daughter doesn't like spicy foods. They came out delicious. They are much better then what you buy in the store. I also strained the green peppers as some of the other reviews suggested. I fried it in a pan with a little margarine and it was wonderful. I will definitely make another batch to freeze. I was also thinking that these would make a great meatball substitute for spaghetti. You could form it into little balls and fry them up. I also thought that they would be great for faux falafel by flattening it out, frying it in a pan and then putting it in a pita pocket with some ranch dressing. The possibilities are endless and yummy!","These are really great! Dense and satisfying while also being healthy, I found these very easy to throw together. This recipe is also quite simple to modify (ex: I tossed in a jalapeno and used a chili garlic sauce rather than hot sauce). I used an oven to bake these and they turned out just fabulous--no problems with them falling apart, perhaps because I took the good advice of other members and added extra bread crumbs. I'll be making these often!","AWESOME veggie burgers! I am definitely going to make this recipe over and over again. The mix was a bit too loose and moist to form into patties, so I added more breadcrumbs as well as some grated parmesan cheese to firm the mixture up. I used real bread crumbs (i.e. bread that I processed into crumbs) to make them extra good. I also dredged them in flour and then fried them in a little olive oil and this gave them a nice, crispy exterior which added to the flavor.","This recipe is an excellent ""base"" recipe but IMHO it needs some adjustment on the seasoning. The taste of cumin is truly overwhelming--I adjusted to 1 tsp instead of 1 TBS and it was much better. All in all a very good recipe.",I used my food processor for the whole process and it worked great! I used a large can of black beans (it was in my pantry to use up) and just doubled the rest of the ingrediants. This was very easy to make and now I have a bunch in the freezer. We baked ours and I think next time I will pan fry them in some olive oil to get a crispy texture. Thanks for the recipe!,"This is a very quick and easy recipe. I omitted the peppers, used red onions, seasoned breadcrumbs and cut the amount of chili and cumin in half. I didn't care for the chili and cumin taste and next time I will experiment with spices that I like since the cumin and chili over power the taste. I also used an extra large egg and that seemed to hold everything together nicely. I will definately make this recipe again.","Original recipe has good texture. Be sure to drain & rinse in a sieve, not just pour the goup out of the can. Mash by hand, not in the processor; I used a grid type potato masher. For those who are getting liquid in the veggies, chop the them, rather than pulverize, in the processor. I pulsed on/off 2-3 times, scraped down, repeat until 1/8 to 1/4-inch pieces. There was no excess liquid. I doubled the recipe with a 29 oz. can, which measured a scant 3 cups after rinsing. I used 1/2 the cumin and a red pepper, but otherwise the exact recipe. My husband is a hearty eater, but loved these and asked for them the next day. I'll post a pic of the unmixed ingredients as well as the burger.",Skip the egg and use 1 cup of panko bread crumbs instead and they will have the perfect consistency and be a five star worthy burger!,"These are great! I followed some reviews and put everything in the food processor. I didn't have a bell pepper and hate cooked bell pepper anyway, so I used a carrot. I used oats instead of bread crumbs to make them even more healthy. I rinsed the black beans but should have let them drain longer - they were a bit wet so my mixture was runny. I treated them like pancakes, poured the ""batter"" into a hot pan w/ a little oil then fried them up. I got 8 thin patties from 1 can of beans, my toddler LOVED them, was shoving them in her face w/ two hands. Great lunch for us girls during the week - my guys won't touch them with a 10 foot pole.","These were really fun to make! I read a lot of reviews beforehand, so from others' suggestions I added another egg and froze the formed burgers for about 15 minutes before baking, as well as laying the beans on some paper towels to let them dry out a bit after rinsing them. I had no problem with them crumbling or anything. Also, I made 6 smaller patties, and made sure not to make them too thick so that the texture would be even throughout. I also flipped them halfway through the baking time. Oh, and I added corn because my fiance and I love corn. We both thought they tasted good, but that there was definitely too much of something-it may have been cumin, which I hardly ever use. I'm going to make them again just with less cumin, or maybe I'll just leave it out altogether. Also, mashing the beans with a fork seemed ridiculous. I used my hands and it took far less time than it would have with a fork. The finished burgers were served with the Baked French Fries I recipe on the site.","These were delicious and relatively easy. I took some advice of other reviewers and mixed everything in the food processor, adding more breadcrumbs until the mixture was thick enough to form into patties. Instead of serving them on buns, we topped them with pomegranate guacamole and/or sour cream mixed with mango salsa. Wonderful vegetarian meal!!","I just went and reread all the reviews and don't get what I did wrong - but it must have been a doozy because these were awful for us. In seven years of cooking together, this is only the second dish my husband wouldn't eat. These had absolutely no flavor - and I added all of the spices, chili sauce, garlic, etc. Usually if a recipe is so-so, I'll remake it. This isn't one of them for us. I hope others have better luck with it."

57,"I was leary of making this without first pre-cooking the meatballs, but this is by far the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever made. The meatballs ended up a nice brown color, they were not over cooked and I think putting them in before browning allowed some of the meat flavor to seep into the sauce. I great recipe.","Five star rating is based on the following changes. Instead of using all ground beef, I opted to use a combination of ground pork and ground beef (12 oz ground beef, 4 oz ground pork) -instead of plain bread crumbs, I used pre-seasoned breadcrumbs, I increased the parmesan cheese to 4 oz. With the sauce, instead of using 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes, I used 1 (28 oz can) of whole tomatoes, and then two smaller cans (14 oz) of crushed tomatoes. After simmering the sauce, I ran half of it through the blender to make it smoother. I also added a small can of tomato sauce in addition to the tomato paste, plus for added flavour I added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp basil, and 1 tsp garlic powder. YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!","This was absolutly the most wonderful spaghetti. This was my first time making homemade spaghetti. I work long hours and don't have time at night to make a 2 hour meal, so what I did was use my slow cooker. In the morning i sauteed my onion and garlic, combined it with all the ingredience including half a can of tomato sauce for extra liquid since it tends to lose some in a slow cooker. Had my husband turn the cooker on low at his lunch, so the sauce cooked about 6 1/2 hours. one hour before the sauce was done, he put the meat balls in. We did end up adding the extra half a can of sauce just for liquid, but the flavor was amazing. By using the slow cooker for us working cooks, it was nice to come home to a ready made meal and good as this.","This sauce was very easy to make and quite delicious. I do agree with some reviews that the meatballs were a bit bland, but to each his own, my husband liked them. I will never use bottled sauce again, that's for sure. Note: to others who who mentionned they substituted turkey or other poultry for ground beef ... you are never supposed to use breadcrumbs, that type of meat is quite dry, breadcrumbs only makes it worse!","For Celeste, who found the meatballs too dry, may I suggest adding 1/2 cup of water, or milk, or tomato sauce to the meatballs? The eggs will bind them, but not make them moister - adding liquid makes them exquisitely tender and juicy. Also, if you want a lighter meatball, substitute oatmeal for the breadcrumbs - measure it first, then run it briefly in the blender so you won't have any big bits in the meatballs. I added 1.5 tsp oregano and 3 tsp basil; added 1 tsp seasoned salt, 1 medium green pepper. I was very, very happy with the sauce. Put it into a 250 degree oven while I cooked other stuff, for about 2 hours,it was wonderful. :D",Oh wow! These meatballs were phenomenal. I coated them in flour and sauteed them in olive oil first to seal in juices. I rolled them about the size of a silver dollar. This will be something I make often.,"This is a great recipe - although I did alter it a bit from the beginning. Do brown the meat balls first, before adding them to sauce. I think this adds a little flavor. I also spiced up the meatballs with some stand-by italian spices (basic, oregano, etc.) and I upped the garlic (to taste). Also, I used crackers (pounded or processed to crumbs) in place of bread crumbs, and used a little less than called for. This made a very solid and yummy meatball - for those who have ""spongey"" meatballs. For those who used store-bought sauce with the meatballs - nothing compares with this sauce!","I simply loved this recipe as it resembled on of my own. In the meatballs, I used only 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground sausage; 1/2 cup crushed buttery crackers i.e. Ritz; 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder toi taste, 2 Tbsp chopped onion, 1 Tbsp Bell pepper, 1 Tbsp chopped celery and 1/2 pkg hamburger or meatloaf seasoning mix. I prepared my meatballs and cooked them in the oven on a sheet pan for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Then added them to my sauce. My Sauce included 1/2 stalk chopped celery, 1/4 chopped bell pepper 1 Tbsp sugar and rather than 2 28 ounce cans whole tomatoes, I used 1 ea. 28 oz can Crushed Tomatoes and 1 ea. 28 ounce can Tomato Puree. This eliminated the lumpy tomato chunks. I eliminated the tomato paste altogether. I reduced my cooking time to 30 minutes and then 30 minutes after adding the meatballs.","This recipe shouldn't be ""made over"" but put together as written, the meatballs and the sauce are just wonderful, unlike the mass produced, thick jarred stuff. I've read some comments that things were added/deleted, come on, it changes the whole recipe when you do that! Try it as written and you will not be disappointed, it is the only one we use now.","Very good!! I didn't have bread crumbs, so I just used croutons that I crushed up. I used Garlic Herb ones and didn't add anything else besides the egg. Worked out great!!","If you use veal and pork with your ground beef (you can buy meatloaf mix) your meatballs will be so moist and soft. I know from years of cooking with my grandmother and mother - trust me. My grandmother was from Naples, Italy (right off that boat!) and taught my mother (who was German) everything about Italian cooking - she wanted my father to eat like he was still at home with her!! Plus, brown your meatballs before you add them to your sauce. And, make sure to cook that sauce (on low - simmer it) for at least 2 hours or until that ""raw"" smell goes away. All of a sudden, your kitchen will smell like an Italian restaurant - that's when you are sure that sauce is cooked - we call it gravy - that's one way to tell a genuine Italian! Enjoy - your recipe just needs these few small changes/additions - you are on the right track!!","This is one of an almost infinite number of very good ""Italian"" spaghetti tomato-sauce recipes. I am always intrigued when the recipe calls for ""Parmesan"" cheese (""Parmigiano Reggiano"" cheese)- the supposed ultimate in Italian grating cheeses. Occasionally, because of almost status-symbolism, it has been referred to as the ""Yuppie"" cheese. In reality, a significant percentage (perhaps a majority) of Americans of Italian descent use imported Pecorino Romano cheese (I prefer the Locatelli brand)in their pasta sauces. This very tasty and usually much more reasonably priced cheese has been described as somewhat salty, spicy, sharp, and tangy. It is a sheep cheese that becomes increasingly robust with age. Try it when a pasta tomato-sauce recipe calls for Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan) cheese. You may be pleasantly surprised - certainly, your wallet will be.","This truly is delicious although, since my ground beef wasn't terribly lean, I browned the meatballs a bit before adding them to the sauce (after draining the fat). My thanks to the person who gave us this recipe; it's great, and makes a delicious spaghetti supper! Also, using small zip-loc bags, I put a bit of sauce and three meatballs in each to use in the future for meatball-subs on Hoagie rolls. Wonderful to have in the freezer.",The best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had! I used fresh parsley and basil and fresh-grated parm. And I used italian seasoned bread crumbs. Other than those changes I followed the recipe and it was wonderful. I had all day to cook the sauce so it ended up cooking 3 hours before adding the meatballs and I think that made the sauce even better. Next time I will cut the olive oil at least in half so I won't have to get the oil off the top when it's done. This is one of my all time favorites from this site!,"I have NEVER liked spaghetti & meatballs but one night my boyfriend asked me to make it for him and thanks to your DELICIOUS recipe, I am now a spaghetti & meatballs LOVER! I follow this recipe exactly except I use Panko bread-crumbs in the meatballs, which are the bread-crumbs I prefer for everything. This recipe does take a long time but if you plan ahead and follow it exactly- its SOOO WORTH IT!!! Plan at least 2 hours of cook time and get the sauce going first- instead of doing the meatballs first like the recipe suggests. You have to cook the sauce for 90 minutes so you might as well do the meatballs while the sauce is cooking rather than doing them before you even start the sauce, taking on another 15-20 minutes to your entire cook time. This recipe tastes SOOO FRESH and authentic, thank you again!! I wish I could give you more than 5 stars!","I have a suggestion: with regards to the dried parsley....I always use about 1/4 bunch of large sprigs of parsley(stems and all) of fresh parsley...this is a tip I got from my mother in law who got it from a lovely Italian neighbor of hers years ago. Not sure of the exact difference, but her sauce recipe is to die for. Simmer the parsley in the sauce until ready to serve, then scoop the pieces out of the sauce. They claim it is essential to the sauce!!! Dry parsley has no taste in their (and mine) opinions!","I made this for my family during the holidays - I received rave reviews. I however improvised on a few things. I added 1 lb. ground pork (along with 2 lbs ground beef), used more cheese and a seasoned breadcrumb mix. I also added real garlic instead of powder, and used Italian seasoning with a dash extra of basil. I also added a little milk. After I rolled them, I put them in casserole dishes in one layer and baked them uncovered at 350°F for about 20 min. - until browned. Meanwhile I had the sauce simmering for about an hour (I started the sauce first on the stove top). In addition to the whole tomatoes, I added 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1 can tomato paste. I didn't use bay leaf but added the Italian seasoning again. I poured the sauce over the meatballs, covered and returned back to the oven for about 20 -30 minutes. Turned out fabulous and everyone said they were wonderful - even the kids. Thanks for the recipe.",This was good. I didn't read the recipe correct because was in a hurry and didn't saute the onion but put them with the olive oil right into the tomato sauce and it turned out just fine. Not a problem at all and saved effort if you are in a hurry to get it mixed up. I actually simmered it for about 3 hours. My husband said he liked but thought Prego was just as good... Prego does have a good sauce! So may not put this much effort for awhile to sauce since my family liked prego equally as much. THe meatballs were very good... I have made them like this but used soda cracers instead and liked that alot too.,"Best tomato sauce I've ever made, really flavoursome and tasty. I think 2 tsps of salt is too much, I had to add another can of tomatoes to make it edible! I used cracker crumbs instead of breadcrumbs because that is what I had on hand and it was great. I was sceptical about putting the meatballs straight into the sauce without browning, but they turned out great! Brilliant recipe.","Rating based on the following changes: SAUCE: BLENDED the whole tomatoes for a smoother sauce. Added 1 stalk chopped celery, 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp basil, 1 tsp garlic powder. Doubled the tomato paste (13 oz can). MEATBALLS: Used ground steak instead of store bought ground beef. Added 1/2 cup milk, 3/4 cup minced onion, 1 tsp of onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning. Doubled the garlic powder (1/4 tsp) and eggs (2 eggs). Omitted the parmasan cheese. Simmer meatballs for at least 1 hour (they were still pink after 30 min). Meatballs were mushy, so I would recommend browning or cooking in the oven for a firmer meatball. A GREAT recipe if you make these changes. It was my first homemade sauce attempt and tastes better the next day. Even after freezing, it tasted great. Just add some of the pasta water to it and some salt, and it's perfect. After making a different sauce recipe, I am definitely returning to this one. Just make sure to blend the whole tomatoes if you prefer a smooth but thick sauce.","Delicious! I doubled the recipe and used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork, which makes all the difference in my opinion. I used 2-28oz cans of whole San Marzano tomatoes, and 2-28oz cans of crushed tomatoes. I sauteed the onion and garlic then transferred to my crock pot with the other ingredients and set on low for 7 hours. I also used 3/4 cup of Progresso Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the fresh bread crumbs. I never follow a recipe to make sauce and meatballs, but this is great, and my changes are because of personal preference. Instead of the basil, an Italian seasoning blend would work just great. Wonderful, classic meatball and sauce recipe! Thanks for sharing :)","The sauce was way too sweet. It was also a bit bland. I tried it again without the onion and sugar, and added some oregano and a bay leaf and it was much better.",Awesome! I have never made a sauce completely from scratch that I liked so I have always doctored up bottled sauce. Not anymore! I am salivating just thinking about this recipe. I love not having to brown meatballs first. Cooking the meatballs in the sauce really does add to the flavor. I made this as written the first time but the second time I put sauce in blender before the last additions to make the sauce smoother. Excellent both ways!,"Fantastic! Who needs pre-made meatballs or jarred sauce anymore? I did add 1 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning and doubled the garlic for the meatballs. To moisten them, I added 1/2 cup of milk to the meat before mixing in the seasonings. It really makes them tender and moist! I added 1/2 cup of red wine to the simmering sauce.","I had never made home-made spaghetti sauce before and am I glad I chose this one as my first! I followed the recipe almost exact, made a huge pot for family and company. It was all eaten! Our family loves italian sausage so I added some to the meatballs. Very, very good recipe! Thanks so much.","This is a wonderful recipe, and easy as well. I like to add a little red wine in the sauce for an extra kick. And Diane, please refrain from correcting everyone's spelling. Reading your posts, your grammar isn't exactly book-worthy, either. This is supposed to be a recipe exchange site, not an English test.",,,,,,,,,,
58,"These were very nice. I was expecting outstanding flavour for five stars though and this just didn't make it. Next time I would add sweet chilli sauce, more tomato and garlic. Fresh basil is a must! UPDATE: I have now modified this recipe to suit our family's taste and I have to say that it is worthy of 5* now. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a whole can of diced tomatoes, doubled the garlic, more basil, 1/4 cup sweet chilli sauce, 1 tblsn of red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup oil and pulsed the lot in my food processor. Verrryyy nice.","For a small Oscar Party I made an arrangement of skewer recipes. My friend Kristi ABSOLUTELY loved this one. But a word to the wise, if you for some reason not to grill the shrimp and instead make it on the stove, BIG mistake. I became lazy and mad waiting for my boyfriend and decided to use the stove and a skillet. It had to be scrapped, the grill allows some of the seasonings to air out especially the garlic and adds a great taste that can not be replicated on the stove.","This is a super simple and yummy recipe. The only thing I did differntly is used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, as I didn't want to open a large can of tamato sauce for such a little amount.","This recipe is AWESOME!!! Made these for a 4th of July party and they literally flew off the table. After reading other reviews, I used the largest shrimp I could find, replaced the tomato sauce with chili sauce, upped the cayenne pepper, marinated them for two hours and then grilled. People were raving about them and calling to each other to come try them. Definitely a success. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!","I marinated 1 lb. of shrimp (the frozen, peeled and deveined kind) in a full batch of the marinade (enough for 2 people). I used dried basil, white wine vinegar, and extra garlic. I then made a seperate double batch of the marinade with a huge piece of elephant garlic which I then emulsified in the blender and then heated on the stove. I cooked the shrimp in a skillet over medium-high heat until pink and served it over angel-hair pasta with the extra sauce and some parmesan cheese. My husband raved over it and even has me passing out the recipe to his co-workers!!! Definitely a keeper!","Just perfect and delicious as written, though I didn't bother with skewers since I only made enough shrimp for hubby and myself. No need to change a thing, unless you feel some compelling desire to do so. Just enough flavor and seasoning--enough to be noticeable, but in a way that enhances the shrimp rather than overpowering its own wonderful and delicate flavor. This is an example of how using a few simple but flavorful and fresh ingredients is usually best.","OMG, this is hands-down the best shrimp i have ever tasted in my whole entire life. this marinade is soooooo good..i think it's the combination of all the ingredients that makes this so tasty. i brushed the left-over marinade over the shrimp while it was on the grill. this recipe is highly recommended!!!!! TIP: even if you don't have time to let the shrimp marinate for one hour, just throw everything together and brush the rest of the marinade on the shrimp while its grilling...it still tastes amazing!!","This was very good! The first time we made it we used small pre-cooked shrimp and grilled it on the Foreman Grill (without skewers) and it came out great. The second time, we doubled the marinade and then cooked the shrimp and marinade in a skillet and poured it over rice. The heat made the sauce pretty thin so now I reserve 1/2 cup marinade and add one tablespoon cornstarch to it, then combine it all in the skillet. *TIP: One thing I do different is I only use a quarter or a third of the olive oil called for. It doesn't really add anything and it just kinda separates into this oily layer floating on top, not really blending with the tomato sauce. Now I usually quadruple the marinade (with the exception of the olive oil) when using the marinade as a sauce. We've also made this with small pieces of chicken and it is very good! Thanks for this recipe!","I'll admit, I was skeptical at first....the ingredients seemed a bit odd together. And then I ate it. WOW! This is fantastic, the BEST. I made it exactly as the recipe states, and it has gained the highest rating in my cookbook, ""The Standard"", which means look no more for a better recipe! It's the closest I've come to the best shrimp I've ever had in my life, which was at a Cozumel beach bar/grill and the owner was NOT coming out with the recipe. This makes me fantasize a little less about HIS shrimp. :) ADDENDUM 2/16/03----------Still LOVE this recipe, and I'm delighted to find that it turned out great after just two minutes in my George Foreman grill. Don't forget to soak the bamboo skewers!",I made a few changes -- I used cilantro instead of basil in the marinade (I didn't have basil) and balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar. I then later added the marinade to a can of diced tomatoes (roasted garlic) and the rest of the tomato sauce left over from the marinade and sauted the shrimp. I served it over angel hair pasta. Really good. I'm sure it's great the orginal way too. I just felt like having a sauce to serve with it.,"I chose this to serve to guests at a dinner party - without a test run - because of all the terrific ratings it received. I was not disappointed. I marinated the shrimp for about five hours in the fridge and then grilled them and served them on salads. The flavor was outstanding - folks were fighting for the last few. About a week later, I marinated another batch over night and then made an extra serving of the marinade. I prepared a pot of linguine and grilled the shrimp - then, just before serving, I added the second batch of marinade to the linguine and heated it on the stove top. My husband tells me that this is probably his all-time favorite dish. Incredible flavor. The fresh basil is really the key to this recipe, so don't use dried spices - or you'll be disappointed.","Yum Yum!! I had a dinner party at my house last night, everyone wanted the recipe.I have been viewing this site for years and never bothered becoming a member. I did just so I could share with others what a great marinate. I served this on top of another recipe I found on this sight, Creamy Pesto Shrimp.I also made a great salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing. What a great dinner. Thank you","I must rave about this recipe! It was delicious, but I did improvise a little. I used Spicy Hot V8 juice instead of tomato sauce and white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. While the shrimp was marinating I boiled some fettuccine and chopped fresh aspargus spears into 1/2 inch pieces. Instead of discarding the marinade I put it into a large skillet, brought it to a boil, and added the asparagus. I cooked the asparagus until it was bright green and removed it from the stove. I added the cooked fettuccine to the skillet right before I put the shrimp skewers onto the grill. As the shrimp were cooking I mixed the fettuccine mixture over high heat. When the shrimp were done I removed them from the skewers and served them on top of the fettuccine mixture and garnished it with shredded asiago cheese. Everyone in my family loved, loved, loved it! It was sooo good I'm thinking about serving it the next time we have guests.",Absolutely awesome! I doubled the cayenne pepper and used this marinade on one pound of shrimp. Great recipe thanks!,"We love it, but I dont marinate or grill the shrimp! I saute the shrimp in part of the olive oil and garlic. Remove it from the pan. Heat up the ""marinade"" in the pan then put the shrimp back in. I serve it over rice. It is one of hubby's favorite dishes!","We followed the directions exactly as given and even used yummy fresh shrimp we brought home from our Gulf vacation, but I thought this was very blah. Even with loads of fresh basil and marinating it for a solid hour, I found it just okay and my husband said it tasted too tomato-y. Disappointed for a five-star ranking.",Probably the best shrimp I've ever had.,"Without a doubt the best shrimp marinade. I forgot the garlic and it was still outstanding. I marinated for 2 hours. If you want the full flavor of any marinated shrimp recipe DO NOT use pre-cooked shrimp, it won't soak up the flavor nearly as well as uncooked.","This recipe is awesome. I prefer to thread the shrimp on skewers then marinade it. The marinade actually stays on better this way. If doing it this way, you need to double the recipe for the marinade. I also increase the Cayan pepper in this recipe. For a double recipe I use 3/4 teaspoons Cayan pepper.",Wow! This recipe is great! I have had many different shrimp marinades over the years but this one takes the prize. I marinated the shrimp for about 1 hr 45 min and then put them in a grill basket over the charcoal grill at about 250 degrees for 6-8 minutes. Perfect!!!,My children loved this recipe!!! It was so easy to make. I put all the ingredients in a gallon size zip-lock and it made clean up even easier.,"Wow, this was incredible. I hate when people rate a recipe after making changes but thats what I am about to do. I did not have tomato sauce so I used half ketchup and half cocktail sauce and instead of red wine vinegar I used 1 T. of white wine vinegar and 1 T. of balsamic vinegar. I also accidentally used 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of 1/4 tsp. This dish still turned out better than i ever would have imagined. The wife and kid (11 year old boy and very finicky) loved it, as did I.",This was WONDERFUL! My husband and I are on Weight Watchers so I cut the oil to 2 TB (from 1/3 c) so it would be a little more healthy for us. It was still great!! This is definately a keeper!!,"I cooked the shrimp for my anniversary dinner for two. Although, I broiled them in the oven instead of the grill. They were fantastic! I add a little extra spice my hubby is from Nigeria the land of hot spices. I would definitely recommend this dish to others. Thanks!",2011-06-19 I grilled 6 pounds of shrimp using this recipe for Father's Day & left out the salt and halved the cayenne per personal preference. It was light but delicious. I prefer a stronger flavor with marinades so I'll be doubling the seasonings when I make it again.,Delicious on shrimp. Works wonderful on chicken and fish too.,Very tasty! I added a little more garlic. Will use this recipe again but with a little less cayenne pepper...my 2 yr old said it was to spicy.,This has got to be the best shrimp I have ever had. Absolutly delicious!!! You can't go wrong with this one.,"This was AMAZING! I kept all the ingredients the same, but I adjusted the amounts according to my taste. I served the shrimp over a salad and made extra marinade to use as salad dressing. Yummy! My 9 and 10 year old boys gobbled them up. I was hoping for left overs, but that was wishful thinking. I'm making them again this weekend! Thank you!!!",exquisite because of it's simplicity!,,,,,,
59,"This recipe is delicious. To reply to TMCLARTY, who said, ""I thought the taste of this was rather odd... it tasted way too tangy/mustardy. I didn't have any honey, so I used honey dijon mustard... but I probably wouldn't make it again. Sorry."" All I can say is, please do NOT review recipes if you do not follow the recipe. This isn't fair. If you didn't use any honey and substituted more mustard in place of it, of course it tasted odd and way too mustardy. You didn't follow the recipe. Shame on you for leaving a bad review when you didn't use the correct ingredients called for in the recipe! Please, from now on, don't leave a review unless you followed the recipe.","After reading all the rave reviews on this dish I decided to make it for my husband's birthday. Even though it looked amazing this is possibly the WORST recipe I have ever used for salmon. Don't bother wasting your ingredients. It is bland bland bland. I used an expensive salmon fillet which was more or less wasted and great pecans that could have been put to better use. Next time I will stick to my tried and tested recipe: a 1/4 cup white wine, some freshly squeezed lemon juice, salmon steaks or fillets, 1 tsp dried basil and 1 tsp dried oregano and freshly minced garlic, salt & pepper to taste. Cover and poach it for about 15 minutes top with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and it's the tastiest salmon you'll ever eat.","Both my husband and myself absolutely love this recipe. We have found that it works best if you skin the salmon and then coat all sides of it, it augments the flavor all around. Also, the honey-mustard-butter coating makes A LOT. You can generally halve it without too much trouble.","PLEASE ignore the review below that called this the ""worst"" recipe. It isn't the least bit bland, but if you like more spice you can easily add a bit of cayenne or red pepper to taste. My family and I have been enjoying this recipe for years. I do use cornbread crumbs instead of breadcrumbs when I have them on hand -- just freeze a piece of cornbread if you have any left over, or use those new cornbread crackers I've seen in the grocery store. Serve with a sweet corn and black bean salad, fresh buttered green beans and chocolate pudding cake with vanilla ice cream and you have a stellar meal.","Wow, this is a heck of way to serve salmon. I made this this evening and it came out great. I didn't ""brush each salmon fillet lightly"" though. Instead I spread the honey butter dijon sauce on rather thickly by letting the butter sauce start to harden up a bit before brushing it on. For the bread crumb topping, I put the pecans in a zip lock baggy and pounded them with a rolling pin until they were sort of the consistency of rough ground coffee and I chopped the parsley pretty fine too. Then I used the topping generously but not excessively. Very flavorful. Very easy to make. A definite keeper.","Two thumbs up! This is, hands-down, one of the best recipes I've got from this site. I can't believe that other reviewers aren't drooling over it as much as we are! I've cooked a lot of salmon and this is one great recipe. It was absolutely delicious and very simple to make. Instead of breadcrumbs I used crushed bruschetta, although any sort of crackers would work quite nicely. I used a 1/2 cup of butter since I love saucey sauces. I skipped the nuts since I didn't have any on hand - tastes just fine without them. Instead of fresh parsley I used 1 teaspoon dried. I loved having extra sauce and I served it at the table so people could help themselves. Yum!!!!","I just wanted to comment on some of the negative reviews for this recipe... I have been making a variation of this recipe for years (just the honey & dijon by itself with a little salt & pepper baked - a little healthier without the crumbs and nuts for those watching carbs) and it the compliment of the honey/dijon with the salmon is outstanding! That said, I think the people that didn't like this recipe are looking for more of a salmon-y taste. This recipe balances out the extreme fishiness of salmon (a turn-off for many people, myself included) and, while extremely delicious for those of use that appreciate it, it can definitely be a disappointment if you are looking for a real salmon-y flavor. If that is what you are interested in, stick with the normal white wine & lemon recipe. If you love milder fish and dislike the real fishy taste of salmon, this is DEFINITELY the recipe for you!","It was great... the first time I made this I didn't have peacans so I used Almonds and that was very good, but I figured the second time I'd follow the directions completely so I made it with the Peacans and it was outstanding. I would say that this recipe is for people who like nuts and nice crunchyness to complement otherwise a delicate meal. This recipe also allows for room to play with the amount of spicyness by using more, less, or different strengths/types of mustard. I'm giving it an A.","This was EXCELLENT!!!!!! I usually grill my salmon - year round (Firecracker Salmon - my fav), but was running short on time this eve. I didnt have any pecans, so I elimated them. I used Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs which I added some melted butter to, to make a nice crumbly mixture, as well as additional parsley. When it was done, I squeezed fresh lemon juice over the top. EVERYONE HERE LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!! Served it w/ a salad and some roasted baby carrots and it was GREAT! Will make this again!!!!!!!!",I sure wish I knew why this is so highly rated. I thought it was average at best.,"I don't like salmon. Luis loved this recipe. I am looking forward to making it for him again. He liked it so much that he started eating it before his lunch time. He had to restrain himself from eating it all. 2/11/2011 I made this for Luis again. Central Market had Yukon Keta salmon for $8.49/lb which was a sale price. (8) fillets cost $22.92. I laid out all the ingredients and measuring cups to make sure that we had everything. I had Organic Dijon mustard and chopped pecans left over from the last time i made this. I follow the advice of others and only used (1) Tbsp of honey each time. I used Italian seasoned Progresso bread crumbs. I had to buy fresh Italian flat leaf parsley and salmon from Central Market. I spread the thick honey mustard sauce on w/ a spatula onto each fillet, then used tongs to take it out of this goo, then laid it into a 4 Qt Oxo bowl of the bread crumb mixture and spooned and patted the crumbs over the fillets, then used the tongs to put each fillet into (2) different cast iron skillets that had been oiled. I cooked the fillets approx (12) minutes b/c our gas oven runs hot and does not have temperature control. Since the cast iron skillets hold the heat and the food continues to cook this was enuf time. I woke Luis up to eat the salmon and he really enjoyed it. I wish I liked salmon, but I love fixing it for Luis:) This is a good lunch dish for Luis. He never brings it back home, unlike the Tuna casserole dish.",This is an amazingly delicious and easy recipe. I always make extra so I can eat it for lunch the next day.,"The best advice I can give you is TASTE the honey mustard mixture before you spread it on your fish, if you don't like it there, you won't like it on the fish so adjust it accordingly, add cracked black pepper, more honey, try whole grain mustard, adjust it until it appeals to you, then you know you will enjoy it on the fish. I know the recipe says lightly but I smeared it on a little heavier. I also opted or more pecans than breadcrumbs, I don't like ""fillers"" when I can avoid them. Don't go out and buy breadcrumbs, if you have a food processor on your counter, use it! Grab a chunk of that baguette in your fridge and pulse it to crumbs, I used half a buttermilk biscuit left over for lunch and then chopped pecans, pulsed it in the processor to a coarse meal. You can also substitute walnuts for this as well and it would be good. For using frozen salmon filets instead of fresh, thaw your filets in cold water until pliable, dry them off with a paper towel and continue on with the recipe normally. I also suggest making a little extra of the dijon honey spread, even after smearing it on liberally, the flavor really didn't come out in the fish, a drizzle over the top of the finished filet or a little puddle next to it is a good addition. If you have extra beyond that, if you cut it with a bit of cider vinegar turning it to a dressing its a nice accompaniment tossed with a little fresh baby spinach.","I didn't have pecans or parsley, so I just salt&peppered some bread crumbs and sprinkled them over the top. We really enjoyed it! We've done the white wine poach thing to death and were happy to have the change to something different. Someone in these reviews talked about how some people don't follow the recipe, substitute ingredients, and then give the recipe a bad review....I can't stand it when people do that! Give the recipe a fair try at least, and have the brains to realize that it might not be to your taste and that it probably isn't a bad recipe at all....especially when you see that lots of other people like it.",My first 5* rating! What a fantastic tasting salmon! Probably great with chicken too! Suggestions: 1. Mix the sauce in the baking dish rather than only brushing it on. 2. Cook any veggies like broccoli or carrots in the same baking dish with the same sauce. Yummy!,"This was WONDERFUL! I Love salmon, butusually eat it grilled cause I hate the fishiness of baked fish. This recipie changed my view on baking fish, it was so tender and delicious I could have eaten 5 more pounds of it. I didnt use pecans because I hate nuts, so i added 2 cloves of garlic instead. I also used a mix of dijon and horseradish dijon, it gave it a nice flavor. I will be making this dish again I can promise you that!!!:::ON A SIDE NOTE::: I Eat this dish alot. 90% of my salmon i make this way, but the more I eat it the more i realize that 1 1/2 Tablespoons of honey is TOO much, i suggest about 1 or LESS. My; and im sure your guests would agree that less sweet is better but still 5 stars!","Fantastic! Thanks, Arnie! I took the advice of other reviewers and made these modifications, and it came out perfect: season the filets with salt & pepper prior to adding the mustard/honey mixture, painted the sauce on thickly by allowing it to firm a bit first, marinated it in the brushed-on sauce for 2 hours, & added a little olive oil to the breadcrumb mixture to get it brown and crispy. Served it with rice that had a vegetable soup mix cooked in with it. My family loved it!",So easy and quick and so good! Like a gourmet meal!!,"Greay recipe! Mine took much longer to cook, but my salmon might have been too thick. Will make again.","I am a salmon lover, and this is probably the best salmon I've ever had...definitely the best that I've ever made at home. Because of warnings about an overwhelming mustard taste, I was careful to follow the directions of using just a light coating of sauce on the filets...then I served some of the extra sauce on the side for dipping. It was wonderful, the pecans added a great sweet crunch, and my guests loved it. Will make this again and again.","This is a wonderful recipe! A co-worker gave this recipe a few years ago and told me to double the topping ingredients. I serve it over a bed of steamed spinach - my family requests it often. Anyone that thinks this reciped bland, should just increase the topping!",I followed the recipe exactly as posted and I found the dijon crust to be very bland. Fortunately I had enough of the honey dijon dressing left over to use as a sauce on the side which somewhat saved it. pretty disappointed overall. it's unlikely i'll be using this recipe again.,"This is a quick, easy and very tasty way to prepare salmon. If you like to taste your salmon and not have it overpowered by a sauce or marinade, try this one. Shame, shame to reviewers that changed the ingredients and then trashed this recipe. You should always try a recipe as written and then adjust it to your personal taste. For those of us in a cold climate, this is a great way to enjoy salmon when the BBQ is put away for the winter. No need to change anything in this recipe. Very nice Arnie, thanks.",Wow- this is the best salmon recipe I have found. I made this for my husband and then I made it 2 more times within the next month for guests. It was a huge hit and everyone was wondering what was in it. I used ground pecans and it seemed to mix better with the bread crumbs. A keeper!,"Have been making this recipe for almost 10 years and it is still my ""go to"" recipe for company and have always had rave reviews...even by people who don't particularly like salmon. Try different mustards and honeys for a change....add orange instead of lemon, or use marmalade instead of honey.","1Use a good salmon such as Alaskan or Coho. 2) To insure not to much mustard flavor, add the mustard (to taste) to the honey and then add it to the butter. 3) To control the consistency of the coating, stir the bread into the butter - mustard - honey mixture. Then add the parsley and nuts. 4) If you are baking a thicker fillet of salmon, you can insure a more even baking by first sauting the salmon for a minute or two in a skilet. (Hopefuly the skin will stick to the skillet and can be discarded.) Put the salmon in the baking pan, add the topping and put the salmon in the oven to finish. 5)I prefer to skin the salmon. If your salmon is frozen, you can lift one corner of the skin from the salmon filet and pull and the skin will easily be removed with no waste.","I don't care for salmon at all, but my husband loves it, so I find myself cooking it alot and looking for a way to cook it that I can stand it. This was just the recipe, this was so good, now even I can't wait to have salmon again, I've made this twice now, the second time I just olive oil, dijon,garlic, and lemon juice.Then topped with crumbs it turned out good also. Thanks so much for sharing",Very good dish - I didn't have dijon mustard so I had to substitue honey mustard. I also did not have pecans but the dish was still great! I love the sauce and was very liberal in adding it - forget the 'brush lightly' and slather it on!!!,Yuck! One of the worst recipes I've tried from this website. If you like Mayo then I suppose the topping will appeal to you. Definitely not what I was hoping for with all the wonderful reviews.,"This really is very good and very versatile. I am not one to give 5 stars unless a recipe is extremely versatile, and has *unusually* excellent results. Have used cornbread crumbs, walnuts, brown sugar, maple syrup etc. as subs with great success. I really dislike salmon and still enjoyed this dish and hubby with thrilled - he likes salmon but hates nuts. Really very good recipe!","This was a suprise, I liked it better than I thought I would. The honey-mustard mix went very well with the salmon and I used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I'll make this again.",This dish was amazing! I made it for my parents and they loved it. The flavors compliment the salmon wonderfully and the coating also works well with chicken.,"Ahh, now this is my kind of recipe. It is soo easy to make and the taste is quite divine. One thing I have done to make it even easier is make a big batch of the dry ingredients. I suppose you could do the same for the honey, mustard, and butter but I have no idea how long it will keep for. About the peacans. I tried pecans the first time I made this. The second time I used walnuts. I seem to like the walnuts better. Because I like the honey-mustard-butter thing I make extra and drizzle it over the the finished recipe. This is one of my all time favorite recipes.",This was better than anything I have had in a restaurant. Hubs loved it and said I have to make it at least once a month. Thank you Esmee!,,
60,"This recipe was fantastic! Everyone in my family loved it. I was a bit concerned because this was my very first time using a slow cooker, and the directions say ""cook on low for 4 hours"", whereas in my crockpot (Rival 6 qt oval time programmable) the 4 hour option is in the ""high"" temp. It wasn't a problem at all. 4 hours was the perfect amount of time for my 2.69 lb pork loin. I followed the instructions to the letter because the ingredients seemed perfect---and they were. For the wine, I used the wine I was drinking that night---a cabernet sauvignon. Also, halfway through the cooking time I did stab the pork a couple of times so that the sauce would seep in. I served this with some mashed potatoes (perfect side dish because there was plenty of sauce left over). I did thicken the sauce a bit after the pork was cooked and had been taken out of the slow cooker. I used 2 tbsp of cornstarch and enough water to dissolve it and remove any lumps. I poured this into the crockpot and stirred for a minute and let it sit in a high temp for 10 min. It was great---a definite keeper!","I wish I could give this 6 stars. My husband made obscene noises when he tasted it and my daughter who is sick and has no appetite even ate a large helping. Here is what I did - we are not big garlic people, so I made a dry rub of salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder and rubbed the tenderloin down. Then I seared it in a pan before putting it in the crockpot. The rest of the ingredients, I mixed them all in a bowl (used the liquid to deglaze the pan I seared in for the heck of it), and poured that over the pork. When it was done (cooked it for 6 hours on low), I poured the juices in a saucepan, brought them to a boil, and added flour and water to make gravy. Amazing is right!","Good, simple recipe which turned out excellent with a few additions. My only major change was in replacing the dry onion soup with a fresh onion, cut in rings.To the cup of water, I added a tsp. of beef stock. My choice of wine was what I had... a Chianti. Other than that, it came down to adding a bit more flavor. I added rosemary, thyme, celery powder, a splash of worcestershire, granulated garlic and parsley. Cook time was right on, and the Tenderloin was ""melt in your mouth."" Strained the onion into the au jus to thicken the gravy slightly, (which was delish,) and served with mashed potatoes. Thanks for the post, LLAU.","WOW! This is the best thing I've ever made in the crock pot! I almost always make a recipe exactly as it states the first time, and then make my modifications. After reading a couple of reviews that complained about it being bland, I decided that I was going to put slivers of garlic in the roast before cooking it. I LOVE garlic, and ended up using half a head (yeah, that's not a typo) throughout the roast. If you've never done it before, all you do is stab the roast and shove a clove or half a clove in the slit. This way the flavor permeates the meat. Anyway, I used LOW SODIUM soy sauce and everything else as stated. It was done and super tender after the four hours, but I cooked it on low for about another half hour then kept it on warm until my husband came home. I decided to add a little corn starch to thicken the juices, and man, was this roast incredible! I could cut the meat with my fork! Everyone should absolutely try this once!","How foolish of me, an experienced cook, to even contemplate trying this recipe. What a way to ruin a beautiful (and expensive) pork tenderloin. Let's save crock potting for the less tender cuts of meat. Smelled heavenly but tasted oh so mediocre. Sorry for the bad review. Different strokes for different folks I guess.","My family loved this dish, even our picky eaters! The recipe calls for it to be cooked for 4 hours on LOW. Reviewers have reported out in a variety of ways on the setting issue. However, I can tell you that it was not done at that setting. I had to jack up the heat to HIGH and dinner was late. Next time, I will cook it for 4 hours on HIGH.","One of our family faves. So easy to make, and so tasty, and the best part is it's in the slow cooker, so you can get out and enjoy the day! I see a lot of people are complaining that it is too salty, but I didn't think so, the trick may be to use a good red wine, not a cooking wine, as those are loaded with sodium!","At the risk of sounding like a know it all I should like to pass along a few hints about salt content on this recipe. Dry onion soup is high in salt and also contains MSG another salt/flavour enhancer. Better to use either a sliced fresh onion or 1T of dehydrated onions and a cup of low sodium beef broth. Soy sauce is another source of high sodium; the alternative is low salt soy sauce. For a crust, roll the tenderloin in salt free crackers and potato flakes mixed with herbs de provence (basil,parsley,marjoram,chevril and oregano) or herbs of your choice. For those who want that extra kick of salt add it to your own serving at the table.","Quite a few said that this recipe was too salty. I make my own dry onion soup mix (equals 1 packet) -- 8 tsp. dried onion flakes, 1 1/2 tsp. dried parsley, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. tumeric, 1/2 tsp. celery seed, 1/2 tsp. sugar, and 1/4 tsp. ground pepper. Hope this helps.","This was so easy and tasted so amazing! I did not brown the pork before adding it to the slow cooker, and I did stud it with fresh garlic (as recommended by another reviewer). I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli, and was a delicious meal. Will be making this time and time again!","I made this last night and it was truly AMAZING! Thank you LLAU! I skipped the soy sauce, as we don't like our food too salty, I used Merlot and it was quite nice, very tender, the pork fell right off our forks! My hunny loved it too, which is even better! Thanks again for sharing! *****","This was just what I was looking for! So easy and delicious, it also makes your house smell wonderful. I did add 1 TBSP. Worcheshire sauce, used Shiraz for the wine and it came out delicious! I will definitely make this again!","Very good flavor. However, I made a HUGE substitution. I used a PORK LOIN instead of a Tenderloin. Pork tenderloin is tender, succulent & does not EVER belong in the crockpot! That makes about as much sense as boiling a filet mignon! Just do not do it. Plus it's expensive. Oh, & I also added rosemary.","Ended up making this with a 5-pound pork butt for a New Year's Eve dinner party. I'm usually not a red wine drinker but knew that some of my guests were, so I decided to try and find a recipe that I already had all the ingredients on hand for and this one certainly fit the bill. Oh boy, was this good!!! I followed the directions for the most part, but studded the meat with garlic slivers and used my best Merlot as per other reviews. Cooked it on low for 7-8 hours, pulled it out, the meat literally fell off the bone, piled the chunks on a pretty platter, covered it loosely with tin foil while I thickened the sauce with cornstarch on high for a few minutes and then poured a little over au jus style, leaving the rest for my guests to use over potatoes. As a side dish, I sauteed a mixture of sugar snap peas, baby pearl onions and roasted red pepper strips seasoned with garlic salt and a little red pepper. Added our favorite cheese bread from the deli and ended up with an extremely easy to fix meal that all 10 of our guests raved about. And me, the white wine drinker, can't wait to dig into the leftovers tonight!","Sure this may have been fav'd by lots of home cooks, but that is more representative of how many people will put the WRONG cut of meat in a slow cooker. The flavor profile looks fine, just DON'T use tenderloin. Instead go choose a cheaper shoulder or leg cut for this and the flavor will be even better. Save tenderloin for grilling or quick roasting where you can even leave it slightly under done, like med-well. It will be very tender, and you get to taste a high quality cut the way it's meant to be served.","Best Recipe Ever!! I found this recipe years ago on this website before i was a member. It was emailed to me today in my daily dish, (now im a member) so I thought that I would come one here and tell everyone how great it is. My husband loves it and requestes it often. It also works with just about any kind of pork, sometimes i just dont have a tenderloin and will use chops. I make it just as the directions say, and it is perfect everytime. I love this and so does my husband. anyone who has been a guest when i have made this has raved. Im sure i will be making this forever. I recommend this to EVERYONE!! THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!!","Used pork loin roast - much less expensive - wonderfully flavored and tender. I skip the searing of the roast, simply place all in the crockpot and go to work. Superior flavored gravy. Also, this freezes well. Great to make, cool and slice, put into containers with gravy for meals for shut-ins or freezer meals elderly parents that refuse Meals-On-Wheels. Reheats well in microwave after thawing.","This recipe truely deserves it's name. I don't cook much with wine, but the underlying flavors were to die for! Today, I did follow some suggetstions of others, opted for fresh onion, and beef flavored granuals, and being a ""gravy lover"" did thicken the ""au jus."" Had mashed spuds and kernal corn along side... Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!!","I made this for Sunday dinner for my family and my parents, and it was a hit!!! I did take some of the suggestions from other reviewers, like adding fresh rosemary and thyme plus I substituted chicken stock for the water (which I do in most recipes that call for water). I also put carrots, onion slices, whole green beans, and cut up baby red potatoes in with it as well. Everything was WONDERFUL and the moans from everyone as they ate it was priceless! My husband who doesn't like vegetables ate them all and said they were great, ""the best he has ever had"". Thanks for the recipe!!","Delicious! Used low sodium soy sauce and probably extra garlic, merlot for the red wine. Cooked on high for 4 hours. Served with brown rice, carrots, and broccoli. The juice was sooooo tasty!","I found this recipe really easy to make and tasty, my whole family enjoyed it. I stuck to the exact recipe and I agree with some of the other reviews that it is salty. Next time I make it I am going to half the amount of soy sauce and I'm sure the taste will be the same.","This recipe was good, though I found the flavor of the red wine to be rather sharp and somewhat overpowering. A tenderloin was rather an odd choice for this recipe as they are not as flavorful as a shoulder or butt would have been. I will try this again and tinker with the recipe as it shows great promise. 4 stars for time management, ingredients usually found in any cooks kitchen and ease of preparation. Thank you chowsito for the submission!",This recipe is great! My 7 year old daughter asked if we could have it every night...there weren't any leftovers. I read a couple reviews that mentioned it might be a little salty so I threw in a can of whole berry cranberyy sauce to add some sweetness. It was just the right ingredient and it actually made the presentation a little prettier as well. Definetly the BEST pork tenderloin I ever had.,"Ive made this twice, the first time was as directed except with a roast instead of tenderloin and it was a bit salty. SO the secondtime i left out the soy and instead of the onion packet i took some of the onion i have dehydrated and crushed them and used that instead w/ half the garlic and a little basil added to the top of the roast. This time it was mouthwatering and very juicy. FYI since i'm using a bigger roast i cooked it about 6 low for the 4lb i used the first time and 8 for the 5.5 the second time.","The first time I made it, I thought 4 hours was a bit too long of a cooking time. Made it again tonight and reduced the time to 2 hours on high and it was perfect. I was able to slice the pork really thin. I added sliced mushrooms about 1/2 hr before it was ready and just before serving mixed in corn starch to make the sauce into a gravy. Served it over mashed potatoes and it was delicious!","This recipe is delicious! My meat was pork loin roast versus Tenderloin. I followed the advice of several reviewers to reduce the sodium and step up the healthy eating. I minced up onions in lieu of the soup packet, and used homemade chicken broth instead of water. Also, I used 1.5 T of Soy sauce and 1.5 T of Worchestire Sauce. This is an easy delicious meal that goes well with mashed potatoes or baked potatoes. I also made the drippings into gravy! Try this for an excellent meal worthy of company!","Of course it tasted fantastic. Just check out the sodium content on the package of onion soup. Somewhere there has to be a recipe to get that same flavor, but without all the salt. Those of us on a salt restricted diet should not eat this. But, it is still fabulous! I only give it 4 stars because of the salt.",Excellent. I used the two pork tenderloins from Costco. I used 1/2 an envelope of the onion soup mix and did not add any other salt. I cooked for one hour on high then 3 on low. Next time I will just cook on low for 4 hours. I served with mashed potatoes and peas. This was really good and will definitely be used often. Thanks.,"i give this recipe 5 stars because it is so easy and very tasty for the amount of effort required. I don't use dry soup mix but substitute chicken bouillion instead. I think 1-2 tbsp of garlic is all you need. I sometimes use beer instead of wine and it's delicious. I've used rose instead of red too, and it worked wonderfully. I also add about tblsp of cumin, and 1 or 2 tblsps of mustard and a few bay leaves. I often will throw in some potatoes and carrots too. I just add a little extra beer to cover the veggies - it always turns out amazing. Seems like a very flexible, versitile recipe - easy to alter and always tastes rich and delicious - so easy, too!",Made this for dinner yesterday and the result was hardly worth the expense. I think there may be some confusion -- a pork tenderloin is different than a pork loin roast. Perhaps it would have been better had I made it with the loin and not the tenderloin that the recipe called for. Save the tenderloin for oven roasting and use less tender cuts for the slow cooker.,"I didnt addthe wine, and used finely-chopped onion and some garlic powder in place of the minced garlic. Turned out great, although I woul have preferred more of a gravy-consistency instead of au jus.","I would also give this a 6*if I could. I usually change recipes just after reading one that suits my cravings. This one has been made exactly as directed, over and over again. Have a lot of coworkers and neighbors making this on a regular basis ....enjoy everyone....","The dish was actually delicious, but the reason my rating is low is that it was terribly salty. Either use reduced-sodium soy sauce or less soy overall.",,,
61,Absolutely delicous!!! My husband loved it!!!! I did as some others suggested and bought the pre-sliced beef stir fry strips to make it a little quicker. The ony other thing I did was sliced my green peppers into strips instead of chopping them. I would definitely recommend adding the peppers when the dish is almost done though because they get really mushy and if you like crisper peppers I would add them last.,"Don't be fooled by the name. This is not a traditionally prepared Chinese Pepper Steak but it is very good nonetheless. In addition to seasoning the beef with garlic powder, I added red pepper flakes and fresh minced garlic to the crock pot. Also, I suggest adding the green pepper during the last couple of hours of cooking so that they maintain a crispy texture (I added mine at the beginning and they were very mushy). Finally, I added a tablespoon or so of cornstarch (mixed with cool water) just before serving. This created a wonderful gravy that was perfect over rice.","This recipe was DELICIOUS and sooooo easy to make! My grocery store had pre-sliced ""Beef For Stir-Fry"" on sale, so I substituted that for the sirloin and it turned out fantastic (it also saved alot of time and effort not having to slice the meat myself)! I followed the recipe exactly and it was done after about 6 hours on low... the meat was super tender and almost falling apart! The sauce was a little bit thinner than I like, so I took another tablespoon of cornstarch and mixed it in a small bowl with a little bit of the sauce, then dumped it back into the crockpot and mixed it up real well. Then I let it cook on low for another 30 minutes and this thickened the sauce up perfectly! I served it over steamed white rice and then served the leftovers the next day with mashed potatoes -- both were YUMMY! My husband and I really loved this recipe and I'll definitely be making it again!","This was easy and delicious! Will definitely be a keeper in my recipe box. I added a couple cloves of chopped garlic and a few dashes or Worcestershire sauce. Like all the other reviews, the peppers were soft, but I love them that way. For crisper peppers, add at the end.",Great recipe. Good change from your typical crock pot recipe with cream of anything soup. Definitely put the peppers in at the end. I will double the sauce next time. The only change I made was I did not add salt. 7/7/08-This is so wonderful I did triple the sauce this time-3 cans of tomatoes and triple bouillon/water mixture. I decreased the soy sauce to 7 TBSP. I did not add any salt. You need to make it.,"This is very similiar to a recipe I have been making for years that my kids affectionately call Mommy Slop. As in ""what's for dinner? Mommy Slop!"" I don't use cornstarch, and use brown sugar instead of white, also I add more onion, soy sauce and worstershire sauce. Then I cook and add the seasonings to taste.",Absolutely delicious! My husband and I along with our 5 year old and 17 month old LOVED it. Very tasty over egg noodles and also rice! Will definitely make it again. But my advice is: 1) Use fresh garlic instead of powder and 2) Don't put green peppers in until the last hour of cooking.,"This is part of my regular fall/winter rotation. I find it is best to put the peppers in during the last hour of cooking, so they aren't dissintegrated. Also, I find that I need additional cornstarch at the end (when I add the peppers) to make the sauce thicker.","i made this last yesterday and served it on garlic mashed potatoes just to try something different and it was delicious...the pepper steak was a bit too salty for me so I think next time I will only use two tbsp of soy sauce or ommit the teaspon of salt, other than that I loved it","One of the best recipes from this site that we have tried. Hubby, kids and granddaughter absolutely love it! I followed the recipe pretty close, only making a few minor changes to use what was on hand. I used probably closer to 2 1/2 pounds of sirloin completely trimmed of any fat, a whole large vidalia onion, 4 bell peppers (1 each green, red, orange and yellow) and low sodium soy sauce. I also did not add the peppers in the beginning with the the other ingredients. I waited until approx. 2 hours before serving. They were very tender but not mushy. Served over Jasime rice. The meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth and the flavor is excellent. Simple, hearty, comfort food. This will be added to our ""favorites file"". Thanks for sharing!","I was nervous about this but it was a big hit...Nothing left in the crock pot when dinner was over...I fed 4 men and they kept dipping the serving spoon back in the pot!!! I took the following suggestions from others: 2 cans beef broth instead of bouillon, 1 green and 1 red pepper, 1 clove fresh garlic, double the soy sauce (I used light), leave out the salt, add worcestire and plenty of it, add the peppers in the last hour. Add more cornstarch or flour while cooking for thickness. And I think 3 to 4 hours on low is plenty. I'm sure I'll be asked to make this again :)","Such an easy, versatile recipe which can be customized to each family's personal likes and dislikes. I often add pineapple, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, carrots, or whatever I have in the fridge that might complement it. My only recommendation would be to use fresh minced garlic instead of the powdered garlic and low sodium soy sauce vs the regular soy sauce to reduce the saltiness of the dish. Thanks MJWagner68 for the submission.","The meat was tender and good but overall, this was very salty! I would suggest leaving out the salt since the boullion provides enough on its own.","I wish I had read other reviews first. After cooking 7 hours on low, mine did turn to mush, but I loved the flavor so much that I will attempt this one again. It wasn't necessary to brown the meat first. I did make it again, and loved the changes I made: used 1 cup water, 1 bouillon, and 2 Tbl. cornstarch. Cooked the meat and spices (no onions and peppers yet) for 3 1/2 hours. Added the onions and peppers, then cooked for another 1 1/2 hour to 2 hours. Thanks for the recipe!!",Easy and tasty.,"I believe the nutrition data for this recipe was calculated on the basis that lean sirloin beef is used. Out of curiosity I recalculated it for a fatty sirloin, and it comes out high calorie, high trans fats, and high cholesterol. It's important to be aware that for a healthy meal, lean beef is needed. Give a miss to the fattier cuts and avoid having it deposited around your waistline :-)",This recipe is fantastic--it is now an established favorite at our house. I use whatever beef is cheapest. I have also made this a convenience food by browning the seasoned beef and freezing it along with the onion and pepper strips. The morning I want to make it I dump the frozen ziplock of goodies in with the rest of the ingredients and turn the crockpot on! I also never add the salt and use reduced sodium soy sauce and we don't miss it at all.,"I have been making this recipe now for a couple of years & it is one of my favorites. Changed very little. Browned top round steak in olive oil, doubled all the sauce ingredients, added 2 packages of Hungry Jack Brown Gravy mix, and only added about 1/4 of the peppers at the beginning for flavor(otherwise they get too mushy). Added the rest 1 1/2 hours before the end. Cooked on low for 6 hours and comes out perfect and delicious every time. Best served over egg noodles tossed with olive oil , onion powder and parsley flakes.","Although not exactly the traditional pepper steak ...I really liked this recipe, add the peppers and onions about 2 to 3 hours from being done, otherwise they turn out mushy. I also cut out the extra tspn of salt...really not needed. Aside from that I cut out the garlic powder and used 3 cloves fresh garlic and a 1/2 tspn of ground ginger. This is a keeper...thanks for the recipe.",This was fantastic. The steak just melts in your mouth it is so tender. I followed some other reviews and added the peppers and onions the last 2 hours of cooking. I served it over brown rice. Also for my 2 yr old I put some pineapple tidbits into it. To get some fruit into him and to help it cool quicker for him....he gobbled it right up! I will definately be making this again!,"This was delicious. I couldn't keep from sampling the sauce. Although browning the meat and making the broth is a hassle, I would still be willing to make this again. I used very lean pre-tenderized stew meat, which is about a dollar more at the supermarket than non-tenderized stew meat, but less expensive than sirloin tips. This meat could have been more tender, but was not bad at all-- similar to the pepper steak in most Chinese restaurants. I added liberal amounts of garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (as I like spicy dishes). I also added some diced white onion that I had on hand, as well as cooking sherry and green onion, cut into 1-2 inch pieces. I agree with the cook who suggested doubling the sauce ingredients. The sauce didn't seem thick enough with the cornstarch, although this is a problem I usually have. I ended up using 3 Tbsp., which works out to 1+1/2 Tbsp. if you do not double the sauce. At that point it worked out well. Finally, I used powdered Au Jus mix rather than bouillion cubes. Next time, I would cut the stewed tomatoes so that the pieces wouldn't be so large. As a note to those on a low-sodium diet: this dish is quite salty (although fine for my tastes). Perhaps one could use low sodium soy sauce and beef bouillion and half the amount of salt added?","This is something I will cook up again for busy school nights. As per some reviews, the only changes I made were to add the peppers on the fourth hour out of six in the crock pot (on low) and they were perfect, and 30 minutes before done, I turned the crock pot to high and added 1 tbsp of corn starch well mixed into 1/2 cup of hot water which gave me a thicker sauce - served on white rice. I mentionned at the table that next time, I would add some pineapple and everyone agreed that it would really be good, so I'll try it next time, but overall, it took 5 minutes to prepare and was very good... for me, it's a keeper!",I gave this 4 stars and dh gave it 3. I thought it turned out to be pretty tasty and the leftovers were just as good. It kind of tasted like a stuffed pepper.,I hate to be in the minority but my husband and I did not think this was anything special. Not extremely flavorful. Perhaps using red wine instead of the water would help. I doubt I'll make this again.,"I LOVED this recipe. For my dish, I replaced the powdered garlic with 4 cloves of fresh garlic. I minced my garlic and sauted with 2 tbls of Butter. I browned the meat in the garlic/butter sauce. I used 1 tbls of Soy, and 3 tbls of Worchester. I didn't add any salt. I used a 1 green, 1 red and 1 orange bell pepper added 1 hour before finished. Next time I will use 4 peppers. I also added 1tsp of crushed red pepper for some kick. I wound up using 3 tbls of cornstarch and substituted the bullion cube and water for one 10oz can of beef broth. This dish was delicious, it will definitely go in my rotation. I served with Basmati Rice and sweet cornbread.","Great taste! After 6 hrs, the meat was so tender it was almost melting (not so great on presentation, though). Maybe I sliced my sirloin way too thin...Other than that, I used worcesteshire sauce instead of soy, and browned my meat with some fresh garlic. Instead of boullion & water, I used 1.5 cans of beef broth. I added my peppers & onions for the last 2 hrs. and they were still too tender for my taste. Next time I'll add them for the last hr.",This recipe was wonderful. I highly recommend it. The steak was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. I did double the liquid in the recipe to make more sauce and used 3 Tbs. of cornstarch to thicken it. I added half the peppers at the beginning and the other half the last half hour. YUMMMY!!!,This is soo much better the next day when it's had time to set. I added the green peppers halfway also cause of the other reviews. I added some tabasco at the end cuase it needed a kick. Also since the sauce was so soupy when it was done I added more cornstarch. That night I wasn't sure if I like the reciepe. The next day while I was preparing the leftovers I loved how the gravy had thickend and it was soo good over rice. My recommendation is to make this the night before then put it in the refrigerator and eat it the next day.,"Very tasty. I will make again. It was a little time consuming to brown the meat before putting in the crockpot but once in, it made dinner prep easy that evening. I did as others suggested and doubled the sauce ingredients for additional gravy. I tried it over brown rice and Angel Hair Pasta (all I had). We preferred the pasta so next time I'll get egg noodles. I used 3 cups beef broth (double recipe) with 2T cornstarch rather than the bouillon as suggested and doubled all gravy ingredients + added 1/2 t. of cayene pepper. At the end I thickened it again with 2T cornstarch in cool water as others suggested. Hubby & daughter liked it.","I have always hated green peppers but I decided to make this ""for something different"". I am so happy I did! It was so delicious. I served it over white rice with glazed sugar snap peas and carrots. It was, without a doubt, one of the best meals I have made in a long time. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I also added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce. You can't go wrong with this one!","Much too heavy on the salt. I think the soy sauce is the culprit. That stuff is a sodium bomb and it can take over any recipe where it's an ingredient. I've made almost this same recipe for years on the stove top. The only difference between the two recipes is that the one I use (copied from a 1960s magazine at the library) calls for 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire rather than 3 tablespoons of soy sauce. I tried making the recipe with soy sauce in the amount called for here, and got nothing but complaints about the salt. Anyway, you could try substituting 2 teaspoons of Worcester for the soy sauce if you find this version too salty. If if then turns out not salty enough for your taste, more Worcestershire, soy sauce, or salt can be added at the table.","This is a great simple dish. I added 1 green & 1 red pepper in the last hour of cooking, next time I may add them in the last 30 min. of cooking. I also used sandwich steak, which was sirloin cut up, just made the process easier. I made it the night before, on a busy weekday, came home from work, made some mashed potatoes, and greenbeans, and we were ready to eat in no time. Tip: if you make the night before and have a cat, cover the dish as it cools, my cat gave this dish a thumbs up too ;)","This was very tasty. I did not have stewed tomatos, so used diced tomatos with garlic, onion and basil (all I had in the house)...turned out fine. Next time I will add a couple of cloves of garlic.","I made half this recipe and served it over jasmine rice for a very good dinner. I used top sirloin steak and cut it into thin strips. After browning the meat, I couldn’t let all those nice browned bits stay behind in the pan, so I deglazed my pan with the tomatoes (I used diced rather than stewed), loosening all that good flavor, and then added it to the slow cooker. I also added a big clove of minced garlic. I used a mix of green, red, yellow and orange peppers and added them two hours before the end of the cooking time. I also added another 1/2 T. corn starch mixed with a little water about 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time to help give the sauce a little more body. I would make this again, but I think I’d cut back on the cooking time as I think it may not need 6-8 hours on low. I also would add the peppers about 90 minutes before the end of the cooking time so they would be a bit more crisp tender.","This was AMAZING! I don't normally like steak unless it is super tender and this was just perfect! You can buy a cheap steak and get it so tender in the slow cooker! I followed the recipe pretty closely, however I didn't cook anything in the pan before I put it in the slow cooker, I just didn't have time. So I threw everyhthing together in the slow cooker and it came out perfectly. I did take the advice of other reviews and put the peppers in for the last 45 minutes or so. It was SO GOOD!",

64,"Excellent recipe. As recommended, made the following changes, and it turned out wonderfully: 2 T. olive oil, 1 T. melted butter, 3/4 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 T lemon juice, 1 tsp dried parsley, dash of dill weed. Instead of wrapping fillets individually, I just put the foil on top of the baking dish. I also skin fish before marinading (CRUCIAL for lessening fishy taste). Overall VERY easy. I make it with rice & serve the remaining marinade to drizzle on rice & fish.",I would like to give this one at least 6 stars. It was very good. I did decrease the olive oil to 1 (one) tablespoon and decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and I can not imagine it tasting any better. I marinated it in a plastic bag and kind of massaged the oil mixture into the salmon and then left it for an hour. I may decrease the pepper a wee bit next time. For you fellow Weight Watchers I calculated the points for a 6 ounce fillet to be 8.5. ***That is the points using 1 tblsp. of oil for the 2 fillets. Enjoy! Thanks Norma.,"We were trying to get into the habit of eating fish for dinner once a week. We printed out several fish recipes - this happened to be the first one we tried. We never got around to trying the others. This has become a staple in our weekly menu. We don't use fillets, we use boneless salmon steaks instead (you'll need to bake for the full 45 mins. if you do too). I add two slices of lemon atop each salmon steak prior to closing up the packets. Since we prefer to serve this over white rice (sounds odd but is delicious) we omit the parsley so that we're left with a bit of sauce after it's done baking which we then pour over and toss the rice in. We place the rice on a plate, the salmon on top and serve with steamed broccoli all around. Once a week every week and it's never gotten old. I still look forward to it every week.","Oh my gosh! I NEVER liked salmon before - but this was SO good!! I doubled the garlic, halved the olive oil, and used 1 tsp dried parsley. I was worried there wouldn't be enough juice, but after cooking the salmon for 45 minutes, there was plenty of yummy juice! It was a tad salty (and I love salty food!), so I might decrease the salt to 3/4 tsp next time. I will definitely make this over and over again - I'm proud of myself for actually loving a salmon dish! (UPDATE: I have started using this same method for chicken breasts, and they come out amazing too!! I love to serve it over brown rice...the juice gives the rice a nice flavor.)","Excellent recipe. As recommended, made the following changes, and it turned out wonderfully: 2 T. olive oil, 1 T. melted butter, 3/4 tsp basil, OMITTED the salt, 3 T lemon juice, 1 tsp dried parsley, dash of dill weed. Instead of wrapping fillets individually, I just put the foil on top of the baking dish. I also skin fish before marinading (CRUCIAL for lessening fishy taste). Overall VERY easy. I make it with rice & serve the remaining marinade to drizzle on rice & fish. I will be making this to serve again for a group of 52 people.","Really easy to make! A few notes: 1) There was way too much oil!! The fish was swimming in it! Use only 2 tablespoons and reduce the lemon accordingly if desired. 2) I used pressed grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and it was very light and added a buttery undertone that was nice. 3) I added 1/2 teaspoon of dill and was very glad I did. Next time I will add a full teaspoon. 4) I used half the salt and it was enough. 5) I marinated it only 1/2 an hour and it was plenty. You want to be able to taste the salmon! 6) I used 3 (8 ounce) fillets and baked in a small casserole dish with foil over the top, and a light coating of butter and lemon juice on the bottom. There was still enough marinate for the extra fillet. It worked very well except the marinate mix was about 1/2 inch deep after 20 minutes in the oven, hence the comment about too much oil. Overall an easy, low-mess marinate that I will make again with less oil.","This is a fantastic marinade that really brings out the flavors of the salmon! I do not use the tinfoil method as that tends to take too much time. Instead, I put the salmon in a glass dish, pour this fabulous marinade over the top and broil it. I've found that about 5-7 minutes on either side gets it done.","The marinade was just perfect as written...no need to change ingredients or measurements. If you like your fish steamed rather than baked, this cooking method will work fine. I would have much preferred this simply baked, and maybe finished off by broiling for a few minutes at the end. This steaming method just did not appeal to me or my husband..almost too moist and definitely needing some richness and color that baking/broiling would have created. Will try again but open roasted.","I read all the great reviews on this recipe so I just had to try it, and boy am I glad I did. It was sooo good!!! All the other salmon recipes that I have are now history, as this is delicious and easy. I only used 2 tbl. olive oil, 1/2 tsp. each of salt and pepper, and increased lemon juice to 3 tbl. I marinated the salmon for about 3 hours. I had to cut the cooking time down to 25 min. as it was done when I first checked it. Thanks Norma for a wonderful recipe!!","I normally would not eat salmon, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. Like others I reduced the olive oil to 4 tablespoons and increased the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons. It was very easy and tasted great. I can't stand fish that tastes too fishy and this definately didn't. I will make this again.","If you’re making this recipe for the first time (as I did last weekend), be careful about some of the posted modifications. I used two that turned out to be mistakes. #1 - don’t add melted butter to your marinade! Once it’s back in the fridge chilling, it’s not a marinade anymore, it’s a blob of thick goo. #2 - if you’re using salmon fillets, watch the size - thicker is definitely better.","i would give this dish a 10 if i could...it was so moist and flavorful! i LOVE the marinade, and have used it with chicken as well. i took the suggestions of the other reviewers and used 2T olive oil, 1T butter, 1tsp parsley, 3/4 tsp basil, 2 cloves garlic, 3T lemon juice, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper. fantastic!!","This fish baked up moist and tasty. Instead of marinading in a glass dish, I put the fish fillets in a big ziploc bag with the marinade, and put them on a deep plate (and just turned the bag over instead of turning the fish itself). That made this dish FAR easier to clean up. I also squeezed extra lemon juice over the fish before serving. Also, I used parsley flakes instead of fresh parsley, and it was still great. Definitely a keeper!","This is a wonderful recipe for salmon. In my preparation, I used some hints from other reviewers: used 2 T olive oil and 1 T melted butter, added a dash of dill, only 1/2 t. salt, sprinkle of pepper, and baked it in the same glass pan I marinated the fish. Before adding the salmon, however, I sprayed the pan with butter flavored Pam. Covered pan with aluminum foil for both marinating and baking. No work, no fishy smell, and cleanup of pan very easy. Served with baked potato (since oven was on anyway), perfectly cooked fresh green beans, and a tossed vegetable salad. Gave the recipe to my dinner guest who was duly impressed with our meal. Although the recipe is prefixed by the comment this is a good way to prepare salmon by beginning cooks, those of us who are experienced cooks likewise love simplicity with such great results.","My salmon actually came out just a tad bit drier than I would have hoped for, but I'm still giving this recipe five starts because it had a wonderful flavor and I think the dryness was 'cooker error.' I dropped the temp. on my oven to 350, as it runs a little high, and cooked for about half an hour which I feel was probably about 6 or 7 minutes too long. Fish was still very flakey and tender, just a litte dry. I actually forgot to use the basil and sub'd garlic powder for fresh minced (forgot to buy some) and it still had a great flavor. I also layeted red onion and greed pepper slices on top of my fish which added to the flavor. I served it over steamed rice and poured the 'sauce' from the fish over the rice as well. I think I sub'd about half the oil for melted butter because I enjoy a slight buttery taste with my fish. Great recipe!",Pretty good!!!,"I love recipes that are simple to make and delicious - this recipe fits the bill! I added about a tablespoon of dijon mustard to the marinade and sprinkled the fish with dill weed before baking. Instead of wrapping the fish in foil, I put it in a glass baking dish and covered it with foil. I served it with a side of pasta with lentils and my four year old son ate two helpings of the fish.","This was very yummy. I love salmon and I was looking for a new recipe to try. I substituted dill for the basil, cut down the oil, and baked it on a baking sheet instead of putting it in foil. I thought the cooking time in the recipe was off and I was afraid of overcooking it. So it only ended up taking about 10-12 minutes and it was a delicious dinner.","This is a keeper for sure! I noted some of the modifications others made, and I made the following changes: increased garlic to 4 cloves of pressed garlic, decreased olive oil to 1 Tbsp plus added 2 Tbsp melted butter, decreased basil to 3/4 tsp, decreased salt & pepper to 1/2 tsp, increased lemon juice to 3 Tbsp lemon juice, and I used 1 tsp fresh chopped cilantro instead of the parsley (yes! that was good). I wish I had some dill to add, but I didn't. I had two sm filets and marinated in ziploc bag. I placed the filets (with the marinade) in foil just to minimize cleanup, sealed the foil, then placed them in a pan (I didn't have a glass dish) and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then broiled uncovered for almost 5 minutes. I served with rice and used the juice to pour over the rice. OH! This was good!!!!!","I am a huge salmon fan in general. I make it very frequently. My most important criteria when cooking salmon is that it is cooked all the way through just barely enough. This leaves the salmon INCREDIBLY juicy and flavorful. To be fair, I followed this recipe to the letter (but in the back of my mind I knew that 35-45 min cook time would be WAY TOO MUCH). I was right. The salmon was overcooked to an extreme. It wasn't delicate the way my salmon normally comes out. It was tough, and the only flavor was from the topping, which I ended up scraping off as it just didn't work since it was the ONLY thing you were left tasting. I will definitely not make this again.","I took the advice of other and cut the oil in half...a must-know tip. I also added sliced lemons over the fish before baking. I've made this two times and each time it came out perfect. I certainly will make it again and again. Very, very good. My favorite way to make salmon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"You have to give anything this fast, healthy and so full of flavor a 5. Note this isn't a recipe for small children or others with a tongue that can't handle heat. I'd cut back on the red pepper quite a bit if you want to achieve that. For me, however, the recipes worked perfectly as is. As others suggested I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and it's worth noting that this great sauce can be made well in advance, heck, keeping some in the fridge handy for those days you just don't fee like cooking.","This was by far the best stir fry-ish recipe I have ever made at home. I would suggest it to anyone! The ginger is a must, and keep the same amount of red pepper, because the spiciness is perfect! Just one note: if you decide to add frozen/fresh veggies (we did), be sure to double or even triple the liquid ingredients (we tripled them and it was perfect) like someone earlier suggested.","This recipe had a similar taste to General Tsao's Chicken found on this site but was much healthier! The recipe is good as is! I have however, made it numerous times and have adjusted a few things to my liking. I like to double the sauce, decrease the hot peppers and only use 1 teaspoon of oil. I also have found that using uncooked, peeled and deveined shrimp gives the dish a much better taste. I just cook it in the oil until opaque before adding the sauce. I just tried adding pea pods at the end, just until heated through, which was a great asian compliment to the meal. We always serve it over botan rice. A wonderful low fat, low calorie meal!",i would recomend using raw shrimp as they cook so quickly. pre cooked shrimp come out rubbery while the raw ones will be nice and tender. try tossing in some bay scallops too.,"I give this 4 and a half stars, but only because I didn't think up this recipe first! It tastes very much like what you would get at the restaurant. I made it twice, both were very good. I added one bag of stir fry veggies, the frozen kind, just prepare in the microwave and drain well before adding to the finished shrimp mixture. Could use fresh veggies as well, but I like the frozen. I also tried crushing 2 of the cloves of garlic and adding them to the sauce and using the remaining 2 cloves as recipe says, it gives the sauce a more garlic flavor.Also be careful not to overcook the shrimp!","Good recipe, but really, ground ginger? Go all out and put some real ginger in, it makes the depth of flavor so much more interesting.","AMAZING! This recipe is a perfect mixture of tangy not-to-sweet sauce and a little bite of spicy-ness. It really only took 20 minutes (what I thought was amazing!). One suggestion though, if you are making this recipe use 6 tablespoons of water (not 4) and use more olive oil when cooking. Also, don't let the smell of the sauce confuse you at first, I thought it was disguisting too. But, when you cook it the sauce gets REALLY yummy! This recipe was amazing and I deffintaly recomend this!","I have a very similar recipe to this one. It calls for 1 lb shrimp, fresh ginger, garlic, Tbsp rice wine & I add one can chopped stewed tomatoes. It doesn't really need the honey because the stewed tomatoes give it sweetness. Served with rice this recipe with these additions makes it 5 stars & a wonderful meal for family or guests. You won't have any leftovers !","Used 2#s of raw shrimp, tripled the sauce and added just a little more red pepper flakes as we like things SPICY. There wasn't any left, even my 4 year old cleaned his plate! Goes perfect with either steamed or fried rice. Thanks for a super easy, way yummy recipe!",Double the sauce and add a package of frozen broccoli that has been cooked and drained.,"It bothers me to no end when people give recipes less stars than it deserves for dumb reasons like my kid doesn't like shrimp...then don't make a shrimp recipe. But anyway.....this recipe is so deserving of all 5 stars. It is healthy, flavorful and so easy. Wonderful recipe..it is now a staple in my weekly menu.","This was very good. I did do this a little differently for fear of the shrimp getting too rubbery from being over cooked. Cooked the shrimp first then added the green onions and garlic to cook....then the sauce. Let it bubble away for about 10 minutes and added the shrimp back for a minute or so just to reheat. Also added fresh ginger instead of ground and just a little brown sugar to the sauce. Delicious, thanks for the post.","I did make a few changes, but this is really a great recipe. I used fresh shrimp and broccoli. Next time I make this, I will double the sauce. I served it over rice noodles. Rice will be good as well.",Really really good and I must say quite fast and easy to throw together. I did double the sauce but other than than that kept it the same. =),Great! I would suggest adding a bit of some fresh sesame seeds. That little special flavor and 'crunch' is wonderful. Thanks for sharing.,"OMG! This was SO good! I am 100% pleasantly surprised. Another bonus? My hubby's favorite style of Chinese cooking is Szechwan! I like shrimp, but most often when I marinate or add sauce to them, I am left with BLAND shrimp (i.e. the shrimp don't soak up any of the marinade / sauce). That certainly wasn't the case here! This sauce is sooooo flavorful and it coats the shrimp nicely. As many others suggested, I too doubled the sauce, but in retrospect, don't think that was necessary. I had MORE than enough sauce to cover my 1 lb. bag of shrimp (not wanting to waste the remaining 1/4 lb., I used the entire bag). I do, however, think it's imperative to double or even triple the sauce if you plan to add veggies (they will soak up a LOT of sauce). And, on that note.... Although unappealing at first (the sauce smells horrid when initially mixed), the sauce ends up being the star here. :) Oh, and uncooked shrimp are NOT necessary. It literally took just a couple minutes for my sauce to thicken, barely enough time to turn my shrimp to ""rubber."" Serving over brown rice with a side of steamed broccoli (to appease my broccoli hating hubby, I didn't add it to the entree) made this OUTSTANDING. Fortune cookies and iced green tea completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, FOODGU1! :-)","this is a great start up recipe that you can very easily adjust to your liking. I followed instructions exactly at first, minus the hot pepper flakes since I have young kids. I also added colorful bell pepper chunks, tripled the honey, and at the very last minute, added pineapple! my only recommendation is to add your cooked shrimp last, after the sauce has thickened.","Family liked this VERY much...doubling the sauce is a definate must...will make again but will probably back off the ketchup a tad and up the soy sauce a smidge...will also use fresh ginger...all in all, a good recipe to fine tune to your own liking...thank you, FOODGU1","My family loved this one. I added an extra teaspoon of ginger and less red pepper as my family doesn't like spicy food that much. I also added some vegetables: 8 oz of broccoli crowns 6 oz snow peas, sliced on the diagonal in half 6 oz of carrot ""chips"" (slices of carrots)","This was very, very good. I've used both shrimp and chicken breasts in this recipe. I double the sauce, at the last minute I add fresh lo mein noodles & toss with everything.","This was a decent recipe. It was missing something. Kind of watery and bland. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly. Next time I will do a 1/2 water 1/2 soy sauce mixture for the base, w/ red pepper powder & chili peppers. Maybe even tomatoe paste instead of ketchup for richness. Also much better with fresh shrimp as opposed to pre cooked.","Next time I will double the sauce, but there most definitely will be a next time! So quick, easy, and delicious!","This is a very easy dish to make at the last minute. I have made this a half dozen times and most of the time it’s a last minute decision. You DO NOT have to spend big bucks on the shrimp to make this dish. I always keep a bag of “Sam’s Club” cooked shrimp in the freezer for a quick meal and it works great for this recipe. The shrimp are run under cold water for 5-10 minutes to thaw, then peeled and ready for the pan. I recommend you quadruple the sauce! The ingredients are cheap, the sauce is great and since my recommendation is to since this over penne pasta, (or rice) more sauce is needed. In my view, the recipe recommendation quantity of crushed red pepper results in a “medium to mild” on my hot taste scale. I have doubled the pepper which results in a “hot” rating and also have cut it in half for very mild when serving this to young children. Be sure to decide where you want this to be on the “hot taste scale” before you add the pepper. It’s a great recipe but if you don’t measure carefully, you can easily make this too hot for some palates.","This is awesome! We're not Chinese food eaters, so I can't compare to the restaurant version, but this is awesome! I doubled the sauce and left out the ginger (I knew that would make it too *Asian* for Mr. LTH). I also added more garlic than called for. I added a bag of fresh stir fry veggies to the pan when I added the shrimp (frozen pre-cooked, mostly thawed & de-tailed). I served over brown rice. This is so simple, so quick, and so yummy it will def become a regular at the LTH house...I'm already looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!!! BTW-this made enough for dinner for both of us and 1 leftover portion for lunch tomorrow. TY for a great recipe!","This recipe is awesome, especially considering how fast and easy it is! I used uncooked jumbo shrimp- just tossed them in the hot oil and garlic, along with some sugar snap peas and water chestnuts. Stirred in the sauce as soon as the shrimp was pink and opaque. I will probably make this once a week.","OMG, best shrimps ever! Solid reicpe, easy and quick, and out of the world tasty!! Here are some tips from a Chinese girl if you want even more authentic flavor: -Use 1.5-2 lbs raw shrimp(you can buy the peeled frozen shrimps with tail on)! This alone will kick this dish up a couple notches since the raw ones get more shrimp flavor in. -Use fresh ginger! -Triple the sauce, leave out the starch till the end (only use 1 TBS of corn starch, dilute in about 2 TBS water), I also added about 1 TBS of rice vinegar, the sauce was sooooooooooo yummy to eat with rice. Here is how I made it with the above changes. Heat up about 2-3 TBS of grapeseed oil(shrimps are very low cal, so don't feel bad for adding some oil here), cut up about at least 1 thumb size of fresh ginger(first cut into match sticks, then cut into tiny bits), cut up 1-2 small bunch of green onions(white and light green part only). Fry them up till fragrant, toss in the thawed and drained shrimps, fry for 1-2 minutes over high heat, then pour in the tripled sauce, boil for 1-2 minutes, add the starch solution, stir. Add salt. Done! Best ever shrimps hands down!!! gotta try it.","Very good. Doubled the sauce, used fresh ginger, added a splash of rice wine vinegar and served with stir-fried broccoli over rice. Even the kiddo's loved it. Thanks FOODGU1","Loved this! Not only is it extremely tasty, it's extremely easy - two key characteristics of a great recipe! One tip: use raw shrimp and sauté them lightly before adding the sauce. They're much better and not as rubbery as frozen cooked shrimp.","This is by far the best stir fry I have ever made and it is now my go-to recipe. I made some adjustments based on my pantry: I used raw shrimp, I shaved fresh ginger (I keep one in the freezer at all times), and I replaced the red chili flakes with a little squirt of siracha sauce because I don't like really spicy food and it gave me the right heat. My husband cleaned his plate and we discussed how awesome this would be as a beef marinade for the grill.","It was ok. I have had way better at a restaurant, so I think that has ruined this recipe for me. Otherwise I;m sure it's a dececnt one as far as price goes etc.",,,,,,

67,"Oh my this is good! Hubby can't stand any sort of meatloaf. Until now! He LOVED this which says quite a lot. I doubled it and we still didn't have a lot leftover for sandwiches. He piled his plate high! I made mashed potatoes and green peas to go with it. Tip for cutting the grease: put several pieces of sandwich bread underneath the meatloaf. It will soak up a lot of the grease, then just throw the nasty greasy bread away when the loaf is done! Thank you Rempels for sharing your recipe!!!!","I have been making my meatloaf recipe - then taking the mixture and pressing it into hamburger patties. They freeze really well and then when I want a burger, I just pop a couple out of the freezer (make sure to use 2 pieces of wax paper between the patties) and put it straight onto the BBQ frozen. LOVE IT AS A HAMBURGER :)","I have made this recipe twice now and it is really a taste treat. This last time, I added 1/2 cup ketchup, a little finely chopped green pepper, and a few extra crackers. I saved a little of the ketchup mixture and topped the meatloaf with it during the last 1/2 hour of baking. I served it to company and was asked for a copy of the recipe so they could make it too. Thanks for the great recipe Connie.","Simple and excellent recipe. My husband and son love it. My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe! Used lean ground beef & followed the recipe. I'm tired of people changing 10 things in the recipe & then giving a review. Try as-is first, then modify if need be and leave an honest review of the actual recipe.","Wonderful meatloaf! To avoid the saltiness that many reviewers have noted, try using 2.5 tbsp of dried minced onions in place of the dry onion soup mix. As I was out of ketchup, I subbed chili glaze (small round bottle) which gave the the meatloaf an additional kick, and used the glaze noted in ""Connie's Jan 2009"" review. Very tasty!!!! Reviewers Please Note: If you can find cheese crackers such as Carr's cheese melts (gourmet crackers), they truly make this recipe go from wonderful to over the top! Thanks Connie for a great submission!","Umm ummm good!! I haven't made meatloaf in YEARS . . . weary of pitching meatloafs in the garbage time after time. My hubby, who is not a big meat loaf fan REALLY enjoyed this one. I made a couple changes. I used 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound ground pork, 1 cup crushed cracker, part chedder and part pepper jack cheese, a little minced red pepper, filled the 1/4 measuring cup halfway with ketchup and the rest with BBQ sauce. I also used the glaze (ketchup, honey, worchestershire) suggested by another reviewer.","I scaled this recipe to 72 servings for our Wed. night church dinner. Everyone loved it, even the children and teenagers! After everyone was fed, we had 3 servings left! People were coming into the kitchen while it was still in the oven and expressed how wonderful it smelled. Even those who did not care for meatloaf could not resist this recipe!","So good!! I wish I had leftovers!! I made two pans last night for a dinner party (7 people) and by the end there was absolutley no meatloaf left!! I took the advice of Mrs. Rempel her self and used 3/4 chedder cheese and 1/4 mozzarella and I also used Cheez-its insted of butter crackers. I sifted the onion soup mix and added only the flakes and a few pinches of the powder. I made the glaze recommend by KINZ: 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t worchestershire. I poured it over the meat before backing and it made one amazing meatloaf!!",My Family loved it!! I used A1 for my steaksauce and added cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit!! AWESOME!,"My husband rated this meatloaf as ""lacking any pizzaz"". It was good, it just wasn't the ""wow"" I was expecting after reading everyone else's reviews. It reminded me of something the old ladies bring to church for a potluck. It was fine, but I think I'll stick to my own recipe. *edit* I had to give this another try since everyone else loves it so much. So this time I made it for my parents and reduced the eggs to 2, the ketchup to 2 T. and added an extra tablespoon of steak sauce. I also added the glaze of ketchup, honey, and worchestershire suggested by another reviewer. It turned out much better and everyone really liked it this time. I've also made it with the bread in the bottom and without. This recipe is incredibly greasy, but the meatloaf sticks to the bread, leaving you with a soggy bread residue on the bottom. It's way better to just leave out the bread and drain out the grease, because even with the bread, you still have to drain it.","My husband said that this tasted more like a huge grilled hamburger than a meatloaf -- a huge compliment from a guy who hates meatloaf! I added Romano cheese and liquid smoke for fun, but the recipe itself is definitely a keeper! We all loved it.","I like meatloaf and this is very good, destined to be one of my favorites. I added red pepper and a couple of tablespoons of steak sauce to the top of the meatloaf while it baked. I also substituted cheese flavored crackers because that's what I had. There were no leftovers.","I am a meat loaf lover and my wife has been making great meat loaf for 30 years. This is the first one I made and I think it is better than hers. If you tell her that I will deny it. I took the advice of other reviewers and was generous on the amount of crackers, and used almost a cup. I mixed Ritz together with Cheeze-its. After baking 30 minutes I topped with the glaze Paula Deen uses - 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon brown mustard (Guldens). It was delicious. I'm glad I found this recipe.",Absolutely delicious! Tasted even better the next day! Great recipe!!,"WOW! This is the meatloaf haters meatloaf. Most young adults can't wait to leave home to try out their wings. I was anxious to escape Thursday (meatloaf) nights. lol I've made this twice, once to the letter and once with 2 lbs. of meat, 1/2 hamburger, 1/2 ground sausage. DELISH no matter what you do. I wonder about the review from the ""professional"" cook that gave it one star and called it bland. I wonder what a ""professional"" is doing on this website and using a recipe that calls for an envelope of onion soup mix, and how he could miss the flavor it imparts. I'm not a food snob at all but I doubt that ""professional"" does much cooking with truffle butter, knows what a pinch of saffron can do to mussels cooked in wine or a pan of risotto and from which culinary school he graduated. It's delicious, divine and after 30 years of not eating meatloaf, I'm a lover of this! Thank you so much!!","First time around I made the recipe exactly as shown (I find it odd that people make significant changes to a recipe the first time they try it then attempt to rate the recipe. Their rating applies only to their changed recipe, not the published recipe). It was excellent. The second time I used low sodium onion soup mix (do a web search) and added the glaze of 3 T catsup, 1T honey, & 1/2t Worcestershire sauce atop the meatloaf 30 minutes into cooking. The glaze added a little pizzzaz but the base recipe is excellent either way. It's a keeper meatloaf recipe and will grace our table over and over in the future. Don","There is really no reason anyone should give this recipe below a 5 star. It is absolutely perfect as written. Adjustments can be made for ""what you had on hand, or what your picky ""whatever"" will eat or will not eat."" But this IS the perfect meatloaf. IF there are any leftovers, they are sure to be delicious the next day still as meatloaf and as meatloaf sandwiches with mayo and bread. Please don't add a 1/4 tsp. of this or that and THEN rate is as a 4+, it's perfect the way it is. Sorry I'm in a grumpy mood from the heat and drought!",Great tasting meatloaf!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"Very good. Every bit as good as what Ive purchased in Irish restaurants. I made a few crutial changes to this recipe in order to arrive at perfection: add 1/4 cup of worstershire to the ground beef mixture before cooking. Without this, the meat is too bland. Also, add a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup of water (instead of 3/4 c. beef broth) and stir into the browned and floured meat mix to simmer for 5 min. This gives the meat a little bit of gravy, which the mashed potatos love! Finally, instead of 5 carrots, I add 8-10 oz. of frozen peas and carrots right on top of the meat mix and before the mashed potatos. It tasts great and adds color to the dish. This recipe is going in the favorites file. ***** stars for flavor and presentation!","OK, I have FINALLY perfected (at least for us) this recipe. I brown usually around 1 - 1.5 lbs of ground beef. I try and get something lean. Add two tablespoons of flour and mix it in. Then add two tablespoons of ketchup, 1/4 cup of worcheshire sauce, a packet of brown gravy and one cup of water. When it starts to thicken I add about a cup and a half of mixed veggies (corn, green beans, carrots, and peas). Simmer until thickened. Put in a 2 quart casserole dish cover with mashed potatoes and whatever else you like (I add slivers of butter to the potatoes) and bake at 375 for 20 minutes. FANTASTIC!!!!!","I made a lot of shepherd's Pie and this is my favortie. TIME SAVING HINT: to make preparation even faster and easier use instant mashed potatoes for the topping ... although I much prefer fresh mashed potato. If you don't have beef broth use brown gravy mix with one cup water, but honetly, the broth is good too. If making for only adults I will also sometimes add a little HP sauce to the meat mix ... this gives it a bit of ""zing"". I NEVER add worcestershire sauce...blechh, gross..it has anchovy paste in it!!! Also, although the carrots are very nice, you could use frozen corn and or peas instead of carrot (my kids prefer). But if making for adults, I find they tend to prefer the mashed carrot over the peas and corn, myself included. After my husband tasted the one I made with carrot he said ""That's the best cottage pie I've ever tasted!!! And he's English! There is something very comforting about the combo of carrots and potato. Great idea to mix in cheese and onion to the potatoes. (PRESENTATION HINT:I always top my shepherd's pie with a sprinkling of paprika - nice little touch for taste and appearance).","My hubby always asks his mom to bake her famous Shepherd's Pie when we go to visit. I have never made it for fear that it would not be as good as hers and he wouldn't want to eat it. This recipe was fantastic, and everyone gobbled three helpings! I followed some of the other suggestions here and cooked potatoes and carrots together in the same pot. I mashed the potatoes with 8oz sour cream and salt/pepper. I used green onion in the mashed potatoes. I sautéed 2 pressed cloves of fresh garlic in butter with the onions to use in the meat mixture. I cooked the meat mixture with 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and added seasoned salt to taste. I bumped up the ketchup to 1/4 cup, but I think half that (2 tablespoons) would have been fine. I used 1 packet of brown gravy mix with 1 cup water instead of the beef broth as suggested. And I mixed the ground beef with about a cup of frozen mixed veggies (peas and corn). Everyone loved it; it was definitely a huge hit!","I've made this so many times that I must give everyone my updates. First, I season the beef with whatever I have on hand (onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt, meat magic, etc.) I use canned veggies (drained), and then top it with instant potatoes. (I use either 4 cheese or roasted garlic!) Then I top with about 1 cup of cheese (any cheddar mix will do.) The result is delicious AND it is sooooooo much faster!!! Great weekday meal for the meat-and-potatoes type family! I've also made it with the brown gravy instead of the beef broth - husband did NOT like that... he much prefers the broth. Gravy gives it almost a beef stew texture. Update 2: I also use the bagged steamed veggies that I've become a huge fan of. And yes, it does taste better if you use real onion and garlic.. just toss in a small food processor to chop.","As already said, this is a sort of cottage pie, as it's made with beef, however it's wrong. you don't put onions or cheddar in the potato topping, sprinkle the cheddar on top if you want before sticking it in the oven at the end or under a grill, but the cheddar is purely optional , don't mash the carrots, they should be in chunks, no ketchup, use tomato puree if you want, but ketchup is a no-no, a splash of Worccester sauce is good, as is a teaspoon of mustard powder inwith the filling, and where are the peas so clearly visible in the photo? Sorry to be so negative, but it's an english recipe (not Irish), and I've been making it for as long as I can remember. There are better recipes to be found than this one.","This recipe was fantastic! Like other's here, I added a few little extra's into the mix. Instead of the small amount of Ketchup, I added 1/4 cup... I used a FULL can of Beef Broth, and added 1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce into the ground beef cooking section I would recommend adding a 1 cup of corn to the beef mixture as well when you add the broth and ketchup..etc...but use niblet corn... NOT peaches & cream or sweet corn, as the meal (with the carrots and extra ketchup added) can turn the taste a little sweeter than you might like it. I also added a bug dollop of sour cream to the mashed potatoes before I spread them across the casserole...(makes them smoother and easier to spread) This recipe is a keeper and one of my top 10's here!","We REALLY liked this recipe. When I make any dinner with mashed potatoes I automaticly make way more mashed potatoes needed for that dinner, because I know I will make Shepherd's pie for dinner within two days. I made a few changes, which my husband said was the best shepherd's pie he has every eaten. I added 1/4 cup of worcheshire sauce to the hamburger when browning. I used a can of drained peas and carrots ( and eliminated the 5 carrots), then I added a can of drained whole corn on top of that. Instead of beef broth, I used a can of Franco American Beef Gravy. I would recommend this to anyone. Bon Appetit...","This recipe was very tasty. I was skeptical about not using any spices in the meat mixture as I am the type of cook who loves spices. I did add garlic as I cannot imagine cooking without it!! Meat mixture was very moist, carrots lended a sweet taste to the pie and the onions & cheese in the potatoes was truly a great match. Would definitely make this recipe again. Family loved it. Other than it taking a lot longer than the indicated prep time this is definitely a hit in my books!!! 2 THUMBS UP!!!!! Thanks for the recipe.","Excellent! Will be really a wonderful, hearty meal for those fridgid winter nights! Added some minced garlic to the potatoes and meat and a couple dashes of Worchestershire sauce along with the ketchup. Instead of mashing the carrots, I finely chopped them after cooking.","I made this with two pounds of lean turkey burger, and about two cups of low sodium beef broth. Left overs were a hit too. Very tastey.",Needs less potatos more meat. Basically spot on tasteless english food. Needs herbs and lots of salt and pepper. I added 1/2 bottle of red wine which helped a little. Drinking the other 1/2 helped more.,"Okay, I cheated. I didn't have any potatoes on hand, but I did have a bag of ""Simply Potatoes with Onion"" lurking in the fridge which I used for the mashed potatoes ~ using these made for SUPERB mashed potatoes. Continued to make the dish as directed, but added 1/4 cup of worstershire and sauteed garlic to give the dish more complexity. I know others will scream foul, but I had green beans I needed to use, so I threw those in as well... Not a traditional Shepherd's Pie, but it turned out wonderful!",THIS IS GREAT! PEOPLE.... SEASON YOUR FOOD TO YOUR LIKING! DON'T COMPLAIN NOT ENOUGH TASTE & NEEDS MORE SEASONINGS!! YOU KNOW YOUR TASTES. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT! THIS DESERVES 5 STARS!,"Such a winner with my entire family. My small changes make it perfect...I hope they are a help to someone...as I took many other tips from other reviews and combined them. First, I used 1 C of sour cream, butter and some milk (just a tad) in making the mashed potatoes. They, according to my kids, are the best part! The sour cream really does make the difference. I also season them with Lawry's season salt. I sauteed the onions with the beef (used half beef and half turkey..about 1 1/2 lbs. in all) and seasoned w/ garlic powder, worchestershire (about 3 T), ketchup and a bit of steak sauce. I then made homemade gravy: brown flour in oil and make a roux (I do a good bit)...add s and p and garlic powder. Once brown, I add a can of beef broth, then milk to consistency of choice. I mixed the beef mixture with the gravy...so delicious. This was the bottom layer. Next was a layer of corn, then the coarsly smashed carrots, then the potatoes, and a goodly layer of cheddar cheese. Sprinkle w/ paprika and you have a beautiful and savory meal that will be on everyone's request list! This is delicious with a ceasar salad. Note, you can also use green beans or peas in this, in addition to, or instead of the corn. You almost can't go wrong with this!",I really enjoyed this. I did change it up a bit and didn't add carrots simply because our family wouldn't like that.,"Very good. I followed the others suggestions and added 1/4 c. worcester sauce and 1 pack gravy with 1 c. water. I also substituted about 14 oz. frozen peas and carrots for the mashed carrots. Worked out very well. I would suggest adding milk or cream to the potatoes as they were a little bit dry. Very good though, I will make again.","I didn't follow the recipe because some said it was bland. I added 1/2 each of red and yellow bell pepper, a couple tblspn's of Worchester sauce, 2 gloves of garlic to the meat and 1 roasted to the potatoes (no onion in potatoes), 4 skninned plum tomatoes that went into the food processor. I sauteed 10 sliced baby carrots in butter for 5 minutes then added the onion and bell pepper while the ground beef was draining in a colandar. I then added the beef, 2+ cups beef broth and Worchester to the sauteing veggies and simmered. I seasoned the meat with Monterey Steak Seasoning when browning and sauted an entire small package of fresh baby portabella mushrooms in butter until they created a deep colored sauce which I thickened with flour and cooked for an additional 5 minutes stirring frequently to create a thick roux. Added it to the meat, carrots, and peppers simmering in the beef broth to create a gravy. I put less than 1/4 cup ketchup on the bottom of the casserole about a cup of cheddar on top of the meat and another 1/4 cup in the potatoes. I used this as a guide and I hate it when people change a recipe and than rate it but this was awsome. I almost gave up on this site because I have made so many recipes that are highly rated only to be very disappointed. I now sort recipes by ratings then click again to get the negative ratings first to find out peoples complaints and adjust accordingly. This was devoured with requests for a remake in the very near future.","Liked this ALOT!! Nice comfort food for winter meals! I did use a pie crust for bottom cuz...i just love pie crust =) but used can of corn and can green beans (drained) instead of carrots, simply what my family prefers. also added some dales marinade and garlic to meat.","My husband and I LOVED this dish. It smelled delicious while cooking and gave us 2.5 meals. I followed some of the suggestions that said to add garlic and worcestershire sauce to the ground beef. I also added 2 Tbsp of sour cream and some oregano to the mashed potatoes, with a sprinkling of paprika on top for color. Also, instead of using carrots, I put a layer of frozen peas on top of the ground beef before adding the mashed potatoes on top. SO delicious, I will be making it again very soon.","This was good. I added a package of brown gravy mix, frozen peas, carrots, bean, corn mixture, onion and about 1/4 cp of worsh sauce. It was yummy on a chilly night.",Perfect just as is! :D,"Instead of the chopped carrots, I mixed into the browned ground beef (didn't layer) a package of thawed mixed vegetables (corn, peas, green beans, carrots). And at the suggestion of some other reviewers, added some worcestershire sauce. Really enjoyed this hearty casserole.","This is a good base to start from. I used Yukon Gold potatoes & had to add some milk to the mashed potatoes. Extra sharp cheddar worked well. I wanted a variety of vegetables so I sliced baby carrots and steamed them. Towards the end of the carrot cooking time, I added in frozen corn kernels followed by frozen peas. The vegetables were mixed into the meat mixture. The flavor was a bit bland for our tastes but the combination of flavors overall was still good.","This recipe is really good. I had never made shepherd's pie before. I had never even eaten it. It's just not something that was served in my house. However, when my extremely picky husband put in a request for me to make one, I had to find a recipe that would work the first time! The next time, I will reduce the amount of onions because I kinda felt like they overpowered some of the better flavors. I also added a can of peas (I hate the flavor of frozen peas) and a can of sweet corn. Gotta sneak in as many veggies as possible without crossing the line where my husband will actually try it. It went over so well! This will go into my regular dinner rotation. Another plus, is that I can make this in the morning before I go to work and my husband will throw it in the oven when he gets off work.","We loved this! As per other reviews, I skipped the beef broth and instead added 1 packet of gravy mix combined with 1 c. water. This made the sauce nice and thick & there was enough left in the pan to pour over each serving like a gravy. I also skipped the mashed carrot layer and instead put on about a 2 cup layer of frozen peas and carrots. You could use any frozen vegetable combination that your family loves. I also added 2 T. Worchestershire (sp?) sauce to the the browned hamburger at the same time as the ketcup and gravy mix and it really added a nice flavor to the meat...it wasn't just 'plain hamburger', as my husband said. We took this to an Olympics Opening Ceremony viewing party as our contribution to the London Food theme & everyone loved it!! Husband even told me to put this one 'in the rotation'...a major compliment! :)",Just got done having this meal for dinner with friends and it turned out amazing. very simple and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very delicious. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe. I plan on making it again and again.,"Really loved this dish. The addition of the little bit of chopped onion and cheese to the potatoes adds so much flavor. I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of just the carrots and that really made it a breeze to make. My son thought it would also be great topped with biscuits instead of the potatoes. Next time, I will try that idea.","I made this tonight, only altering the mashed potatoes to be instant (time constraints). I had some carrots that desperately needed to be used so I went ahead and mashed them in as suggested. Instead of beef broth, I only had bouillon, I ended up using 1.5 C water and 2 cubes to get the flavor I wanted (I had 2 lbs of meat). Also, I added 2 C of frozen corn to the beef mixture. It's really amazing. I had too much so I baked it in two casserole dishes. Adding some sour cream to mashed potatoes is always a great idea too. UPDATE 9/12: Making this with homemade potatoes adds exactly the improvement you'd expect. Made it for my fiance's birthday dinner tonight with homemade potatoes, 3 lbs of ground turkey, and added approx. 3/4 C of both frozen peas and frozen corn to the meat mix before baking. (Should've probably cooked the frozen veggies slightly longer on the stovetop before baking, but it was still amazing.) I love this recipe and with or without cheese it's just great. Real non-frozen carrots adds a lot.","I loved the flavor of this recipe, but it did not have the gravy I expect from Sheperd's Pie. My kids and husband didn't like it because of the carrot layer. They prefer carrots in chunks so they can pick them out lol. However, I thought it was spectacular against the mashed potatoes. I'd mix the two if I could get away with it. I will keep the recipe, but will not be a regular around here.",,,,,,

70,"In order to get that beautiful, creamy consistency a good risotto is so noted for, I found 15-20 minutes of cooking time was not nearly long enough. The simmering broth must be added little by little, cooked and stirred till it's absorbed, then repeating this step, ladle by ladle of broth, until the risotto is tender but not mushy, the broth is absorbed, and the starches break down resulting in creamy risotto - however long that takes. In my case, it probably took twice as long as the recipe directed, but then I cooked this at moderate heat in order to release the starches slowly. The end result was a creamy risotto with great flavor, the perfect complement to the pork piccata I served it with.","Please do cut the mushrooms in half, I think it was a typo when it was first entered, but you can use any amount of mushroom you desire! Feel free to also adjust the wine to your preference. You can also try different variations to make this a main dish, peas & prociutto, shrimp and asparagus, chicken and mushroom, saffron & seafood... whatever you desire for the last mix in (cooked meat of course)! Optionally, you can add some tarragon to this and add more broth if you like it ""soupy"". It's fantastic! Those saying that it takes longer than 20 minutes to cook, that is because your cooking heat is too low and/or your broth is not hot enough (should not be boiling, but should be hot and kept over low-medium heat). When you add the broth, it should be boiling when it hits the risotto. It should take about 2 minutes for your broth to be fully absorbed after constant stirring. Hope this helps!","The best mushroom risotto I've ever eaten was in Valetta, Malta (so good you'd give somebody's left arm for it)and I've been hunting for a good recipe ever since. This recipe is a close second! I've made it twice now, and I've found that I prefer to use about twice as much wine as called for (and of course then cut back on the chicken stock), as well as add a clove of garlic with the shallots (but I love garlic, so this may not be for all). Overall a very good basic recipe with lots of room for customisation.","Great! With the leftovers I made Risotto al Salto. I shaped about half cup of the cold risotto and pan fry it with olive oil until it is golden brown. About 2-3 minutes per side. Then I sprinkle it with Parmesean cheese, it's delicious!","This recipe was fabulous ... well worth the effort of standing and stirring! You can never have too many mushrooms in my book. That ""typo"" only made it better! ;) I only made one change to the recipe -- because there's an alcoholic in the house, I substituted the wine for white grape juice and it was really good! I found that the risotto was actually even better the next day for lunch, too. It reheats really well in the microwave with a dampish paper towel over the top.","Served with sides of roasted tomatoes and fresh green beans, this risotto made a gratifying dinner indeed! I will have to remember this recipe when I am entertaining vegetarian guests, although I cannot wait to make it again and top it with seared and caramelized diver scallops. I added a clove of garlic, doubled the amount of wine, and used chicken stock rather than broth. I added only two Tablespoons of butter but did add some extra Parmesan Reggiano. I did not need as much liquid as the recipe noted. If you are new to risotto making be aware that the amount of liquid needed can change each time you make it, so always check your rice as you go along, don’t just blindly follow a recipe or use the amount you used when you made the dish previously. As for being too much work…how much work is stirring really? It only takes one hand and you’ve opened a nice bottle of wine for the risotto so you have one hand free to enjoy a glass as you stir. What could be better than that?","This was a fantastic recipe for my first attempt at making risotto. I did cut back on the amount of mushrooms. I used 8 oz sliced white and 8 oz. sliced baby bellas. We don't drink wine and I didn't want to buy a bottle and just use 1/2 cup, so I omitted the wine and used chicken broth in its place. Do be prepared to literally stand at the stove and stir for 20 minutes, though. I wasn't able to get away from it for more than a few seconds at a time or it would start to stick. This made an elegant dinner paired with Sensational Sirloin Kabobs from this site.","Soooo good! Will make again and again! Find the perfect balance for heat - not hot enough and you'll be standing at the stove for ages getting the thing to cook, too hot and it will stick to the bottom of the pan.","This recipe was fantastic. I made it for a group of friends, abd they could barely talk they were so busy shoving it in. A few changes. I agree about adding garlic, at least as personal preference goes. In addition, I used an extra 1/8 cup of cheese, went with a 1/2 cup less muchrooms, and right before serving, threw in about two tsp of freshly chopped chives. It livened up the heaviness of the dish just enough to diminsh my guilt! I served it with a chicken roll up and the crowd was delighted.","This was an excellent recipe, paired with cedar-planked grilled yukon river salmon and grilled asparagus. It did take a lot of stirring so make sure you don's have anything else to attend to or an extra pair of hands to help.","First time making risotto. Great results, but a lot of work. May opt for a baked pilaf instead; similar flavor, less work. Also, save money on the portabellas and just use white mushrooms.","This was my first time making Risotto, so I was a bit nervous about the whole thing, as Risotto has kind of this air of ""mystique"" around it (I blame Gordon Ramsay and Hell's Kitchen for all of my fears. ""YOU CAN'T EVEN COOK A #$(&*ING RISOTTO!!!""). The recipe was spot on, and turned out fantastic! When I taste tested it after putting it all together, I was just shocked at how good it was (and really how easy it was to put together). i'm not sure how much mushroom I put in there. I figured the 2lbs of mushrrom were a bit overkill, so I just used by my definition ""a lot"". and it turned out really well. This recipe can be customized a ton. I'm really excited to try making different variations of it now :). Will definently start adding a bit of garic to the shallots when starting off the risotto. As stated, and as those of you who are going to try it already understand: You need to be focused on the risotto. Not the book you're reading, or the news report that's on...stay focused on the dish. Having another set of hands around will help.","We love this!!! My stepdaughter who doesn't even like me, specifically asks for this dish :)","My girlfriend and I were initially concerned about making this because risotto has a reputation for being hard to make and this was our first attempt. But this was really simple and tasted great. Our only substitution was onions for shallots and the combination of sauteed mushrooms and onions was wonderful. The second time, we found real shallots and they were even better! We will be making this again very soon.","I LOVED this!!!!! The only thing I can say is that it was salty so next time (which will be tomorrow) I will make it using low sodium chicken broth. Also, when the risotto was 3/4's cooked and the broth was absorbed, I took it off the burner. A couple hours later and when I was almost ready to serve my dinner, I heated up some more broth, added it to the risotto and finished off the recipe. It really was amazing and really is a great ""make ahead"" dish - believe it or not!","Sooooo good!! I've been nervous about making risotto for many years. Back in the day all you ever heard was how time-consuming it is standing there for hours stirring the rice and adding the broth. I didn't have arborio, but being half-Japanese we always have the Japanese short-grain rice around. Usually we rinse our rice before cooking it, but I didn't want to lose the starch so I skipped the rinsing. It worked perfectly AND it's much less expensive. Will definitely make this again!","Very bland, and WAY too many mushrooms. Would be A LOT better with a couple of caramelized onions.","Very good basic recipe. I bought mushrooms before reading reviews, so I had LOTS of fresh mushrooms, mostly oyster and porcini. I used over a pound because we love mushrooms. It took the twenty minutes described to add the broth and yes, lots and lots of stirring. Very nice texture and flavour. It will become a regualar as long as there's time.","wow ,",great recipe all on it's own. i will also add some dried mushrooms to the chicken broth when heating and remove some of the fresh ones.,"Awesome! My sister and I made this recipe on Christmas day and every single person asked for more, even our mushroom-hating little nephew liked it. We doubled the recipe and had lots of leftovers for the following day and it tasted even better. Mom said: ""We have to make this more often!"" We made a slight variation of this though: 1) Used more wine and parmesan cheese than called for by the recipe (doubled parmesan). 2) Added 2 tbsp. finely chopped fresh cilantro (you'll see!). 3) Used half of chicken broth and substituted the other half with a mixture of water and a chicken bullion (2 cups for 1 bullion). If you love mushroom, use a whole lot (both crimini and portobello) and defenitely save the juice from sauteed mushrooms and add them to the rice. YUM!",This was a fantastic recipe and a huge hit at my dinner party. The only change I made was to remove the wine as my 3 yr old daughter loves risotto so I substituted the wine with an additional 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I will definitely be making this dish again and again...even try adding a protein to make as a main dish.,"I also used half of the mushrooms the recipe called for. I followed one users advice and prepared myself to stand stirirng for about 40 minutes. I also found that I needed more broth than the recipe called for, but I did add slightly more rice than it called for. We added asparagus and pees. Loved it but thinkit still could have cooked a litlte longer, so as not el dente, but totally creamy, bc that's how I think risotto should be.","Never fails to be an amazing dish, this recipe is so good it tends to be the focal point of the meal when served. Aside from cutting down on the mushrooms by almost half I do not deviate from this recipe at all. As the contributor said, ""cooked the slow, painful way, but it's oh so worth it"".","Awesome recipe. Just did some tweaking: Added leftover grilled chicken breasts; chopped them up and stirred them into the risotto at the end with the mushrooms. Cut down on mushrooms, used only 1/2 pound. Came out perfect; not too many, not too little. Added a minced clove of garlic in the beginning, sauteeing it before the rice. Didn't use shallots or greeen onions because I didn't have any. Used freshly grated asiago cheese instead of the parmesan.",WOW this was the star of my dinner party! I love when a side dish does that lol. It took me just over 40 minutes but definitely worth it!! Other than the cooking time I followed the recipe verbatim. Thank you! :),"We are Risotto lovers and I'm making a mushroom risotto at least once a month. The secret of a good risotto is stirring, stirring, stirring. And yes, you have to stay at the stover. But it's worth the efforts. I often make it with dried mushrooms because my favourite is only available dried.",,,,,,,,,

79,"Ok, I was in need of something new so I tried this leary of the results. My pork chops were GONE. Even my 2 year old that won't eat meat devoured!!! Tonight I decided to use the sauce on chicken. Yet again DEVOURED!!! I am thouroughly IMPRESSED with this recipe! I did, however, cover my pork chops/chicken then last 5 minutes I uncovered and broiled per others advice and I could not have had a better recipe! THANKS Kim!","This was a huge success in our house this evening although I did make a few minor changes. I added diced onion and then covered the baking dish with foil for the first half hour of cooking. I then removed the foil, drained the liquid and poured the remainder of the sauce over the chops and cooked uncovered for another 20 minutes. The result was succulent, tender and very tasty with all the family going back for seconds. Will definitely keep this recipe handy. Thank you to the original poster.",This is incredibly easy and delicious. The chops were SO juicy. I used boneless ones that were 1-1.5 inches thick and they cooked perfectly in 30 mins. I also substituted teriyaki sauce for soy sauce because I didn't have any and it worked well. Just a note: I prepared the full recipe for 2 chops and used every bit. I would double or triple the recipe for 6.,"I'm going to do what I don't like to see other people do and tell you all the changes I made while giving this recipe 4 stars! I replaced the ketchup with chili garlic sauce, replaced the lemon juice with lime juice, and replaced all of the oil with just 1 Tbsp of sesame oil for a doubled sauce recipe. I also added 2 Tbsp of rice wine vinegar, again for a doubled recipe. I broiled the pork chops, six minutes per side and reduced the marinade to serve as a sauce. Everyone, kids included, loved this. The basic dish was a great jumping off place for us!","This was a very good recipe...easy to make and I already had all the ingredients in the house. The only thing I would do differently next time is perhaps try to let it actualy marinade for the day so that the flavor actually get into the chop. This time I increased the oven temp to 375 and decreased the cooking time to about 15 mins each side for a boneless chop (1 inch thick) and then let it sit under the broiler for about 3 mins just to get the sauce to ""stick"" this variation seemed to work out just great the sauce didn't slide off as other reviewers mentioned and the pork chop was tender and not at all dry. I will definately try this again!","Don't know where the poster for this recipe buys their pork chops, but for six pork chops I ended up quadrupling the recipe and using Rice Wine Vinegar in place of more Oil, to have a proper marinade. This recipe is also not used as a marinade, it's used as a baste more or less, there's zero time in the instructions outside of cooking where the meat is soaking in the mixture (which is what marinades are!). 4 tbsp. Soy Sauce 4 tbsp. Rice Wine Vinegar 4 tbsp. Lime Juice 4 tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce 6 tbsp. Extra Virgin Olive Oil 6 tbsp. Brown Sugar 6 tbsp. Ketchup 4 clvs. Garlic minced Thoroughly mixed in tupperware container, added in pork chops, closed and shook thoroughly before going to work. Stopped home on lunch and gave it another thorough shaking. Cooked on a raised rack in roasting pan @ 350 for 30 min a side, reduced remainder of marinade in a saucepan and drizzled on pork chops before serving.","Really good sauce recipe! The sauce was delicious. However, I made the full amount of sauce for 3 pork chops and there still was not enough. Next time I will double the amount of sauce.","I am not normally a pork eater--but these were great--very juicy! I made a few changes though. I marinated them all day in the full marinade recipe and added some minced garlic. Then right before baking, I made a 1/2 recipe of the marinade and as they were cooking continued to brush it on both sides. They were delicious! I will add this one to the ""honey make again"" pile!","Really good chops. Great flavor. I tripled the sauce and marinated the chops for about an hour before baking. I may leave the oil out of the sauce next time as the chops seemed a bit oily. The sauce does not stay thick which was a bit disappointing. I used thin chops but I think they would be much better with a thicker cut. Great marinade for grilling, too.","I doubled the sauce recipe, but followed it exactly. The only thing I did different was sprinkle some garlic salt on the chops before putting the sauce on. They came out really good! The only thing I would change next time is adding a little more brown sugar to make the sauce thicker. This was a keeper!","I make these a lot, and always add garlic powder, paprika and vinegar. Turns out good every time.","I tried this recipe last night, I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations, but I was amazingly surprized at how good it actually was. This will be one I will try again and again. Next time I will line the pan with foil, as the sauce burnt on the bottom of the pan and took a lot of elbow grease to remove!","My family really enjoyed these chops. I used boneless pork and didn't trim so next time I will use less oil. I had also added a pat of butter to the sauce just for extra flavor. I didn't have lemon juice so I used red wine vinegar instead. When I pulled them from the oven, I kept 1/4 of sauce with the pork chops and made gravy form the 3/4 of the sauce. It turned out great! I used the gravy for the chops and rice and served brussel sprouts with the meal. I almost had the leftovers for breakfast! But I waited for lunch and it was just as good!","This marinade is delicious and sooo easy!!I tripled ingredients to make marinade for 6 1-inch boneless chops, subbing teriyaki sauce for soy. Mixed marinade in large ziploc, added chops, and threw in fridge about 4 hrs. I poured all into foil-lined baking dish with quartered onion and baked for 20 mins, covered. I then poured off excess liquid, and spooned double batch of sauce on flip side. Baked, uncovered, 15 mins more. I served them with garlic mashed potatoes and creamed peas! Hubby and kids say this one is ""for sure a keeper""","After reading other reviews, I did made my sauce in the morning and marinaded pork chops all day. Baked at 375 for 20 minutes on each side and finished off by broiling for a few minutes to get that crispy coating - very tasty!",Great recipe! I doubled the recipe to put over rice or mashed potatoes and everyone loved it. I've used this recipe quite a few times already and have used it with chicken as well. I tweaked the recipe just a bit by adding a tablespoon of minced garlic. One suggestion...add the oil after combining all other ingredients.,"This was great, I did how ever double the sauce because my Pork Chops where real thick and I also cooked for less time because the first time I cooked them they were dry so I put half of sauce on the chops and then covered and cooked 20 min and then took cover off and turned them over and put the rest of the sauce on them then cooked 20 more min and they were perfect!","I have a family of 7. Five out of the 7 are children ages ranging from 18-5 yrs and they all love this. However, I did make changes in the oils. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also doubled the recipe. Cook for the specified time alloted however for the first 30 minutes I keep the chops covered. The last thirty minutes I add the second batch of sauce (drizzle it on), leave the foil off, and kick the temp up to 425. This allow things to caramelize. Great combination on the ingredients.","Yeah! On my third attempt I was finally able to get some really good results. First attempt the sauce didn't stick at all, was basically pointless. Second attempt they were way overcooked. This time I doubled the recipe for only 4 chops, except for the vegetable oil, which I only increased by 50% after so many people saying they'd gotten good results leaving it out entirely. I was using boneless chops, put half the sauce on top and cooked covered with foil for 15 minutes. Took it out, spooned out most of the liquid, put the rest of the sauce on top and cooked uncovered for 10 minutes. Then broiled for 5 minutes. Next time I will probably either decrease the oil more or save some sauce to put on it right before the broil to keep more of it intact. Finally, these were some of the best pork chops I'd eaten, required no added salt or ketchup, which I normally rely on since I don't love pork.","Excellent recipe. Truly JUICY Pork chops in an hour. Kids: 9yr and 2 yr all wanted MORE! ONE TIP: Marinade for a few hours in fridge for a deeper taste. TWO TIP: Personally I make twice as much sauce as needed to keep the chops even juicier. THREE TIP: Save on washing up; dump everything in a ziploc and shake, shake, shake.","I made this tonight with 3 pork chops (as opposed to 6 in the recipe). I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and tomato sauce for the ketchup. I also omitted the Worcestershire sauce, because I didn't have any on hand. In addition, I added a package of sliced fresh mushrooms and a large chopped sweet onion. Plus overall, I made more marinade than in the recipe (about DOUBLE, in spite of the fact that I used fewer chops), figuring the onion and mushrooms would need marinade - which they did. The result was delicious, and I enjoyed the added health benefit of the vegetables. Will definitely make again!","These were great! I doubled the recipe for 6 chops and added a tablespoon more brown sugar to make the sauce a little thicker. Cover&cook for 30 minutes, strain pan, flip over chops, brush marinade all over them, cook uncovered for 25 min, and broil the last 5 minutes. PERFECT. I also make the marinade when I buy the chops, freeze it WITH the chops, in the same ziploc bag. Just put it in the fridge to defrost over night and bam, marinated pork chops.","This gets four stars for the following reasons: The pork should be covered while baking, and there needs to be a specification of what type of pork chops need to be used in order for you to have to bake them for an hour. I used boneless and they took 20 minutes.",This was excellent! Add a little more salt,"I love this recipe! I double the sauce,use boneless centre cut chops, keep covered with foil for entire cooking time...which I've changed to 2 hours. Chops are the most tender I've ever had. You can literally cut them with a fork. Even my picky husband who likes his chops dry loves them.","Absolutely delicious! I felt like a cavewoman chomping on the bone to get every last bit off! I took the advice of others and broiled the last 5 minutes and reduced the oil to about 1 tbsp. Other than that, didn't change a thing. This went right to my recipe box & I can't wait til next week when I can make again!","I am only a beginner cook, but you made me look like a rock star! even my picky 6 year old ate the pork chops - the entire family loved them. I took the advice of others and cooked at 350 covered for a while and then poured out the runny juices, then topped with remaining sauce and put under the broiler for 5 minutes...delicious! The only thing I added was fresh garlic to the sauce. Thank you for posting this recipe!","I've made this twice by mistake. The pork chops are chewy, the sauce is like water and tasteless. I am deleting it from my recipe box.",,,,,,,,
80,"I didn't give it 5 stars 'cause I made changes based on others' suggestions that I felt improved the recipe. I halved the peppers (lengthwise), sauted onions separately along with 2 minced garlic pieces, cooked the rice separately, used 1 can of DICED tomatoes* (why would you ever buy a can of tomatoes and THEN dice them?), and mixed the ingredients together after browning the beef**, allowing them to warm slightly in the skillet before stuffing into the peppers. You can use the extra juice from the can of tomatoes to keep the rice from burning. I also added quite a bit of basil, oregano, and Italian seasoning, as well as extra Worcestershire sauce. Putting just a little cheese in the bottom of each pepper helped as well. Lastly, I only used one can of tomato soup. Even cut in half, 25 min was needed to get them nice & hot. Next time, I'll try adding some pepper as well. * Using a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers adds just the right amount of kick to these! **You can also use 1/2 beef & 1/2 3-7% lean ground turkey to reduce fat content...tastes the same!","great recipe. I cut the amount of rice in half. Only thing I would change is at the end. Fill in the peppers halfway with the beef mixture. Add a bit of tomato sauce and fill up the rest with beef mixture and top with tomato sauce again. The problem with only topping off the tomato sauce at the end was that it did not ""seep"" down as I expected it. So the top only had the tomato sauce and the bottom did not. Without the tomato sauce, the beef was kind of bland.","Wonderful! My whole family enjoyed these. I'll definitely make this again. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and a can of petite diced tomatoes w/ liquid instead of whole toms. Used Arborio rice as that's what I had in the pantry. Added minced garlic to the meat mixture. I substituted 1/2 C. of beef broth instead of plain water. Used 1 can of tomato soup & 1 sm. can of tomato sauce w/ a TBS or two of Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning. Excellent, healthy, and much better than the stuffed peppers I had as a child. I think that par-boiling the peppers before stuffing them was key to the texture and flavor.","I have made these several times and they have been perfect everytime with some little adjustments. I double the worcestershire sauce, add garlic with the onions, put the cheese on top of the stuffed peppers, and use tomato paste instead of soup with about a tablespoon of lemon juice. Fabulous comfort food and very healthy! Note: I have also used both ground chicken and turkey and also had great results.","These were the best stuffed peppers I have ever had. I only made some minor changes. I used 5 peppers instead of 6, and there was just barely enough filling. I used onion powder instead of onion, tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and beef broth instead of water for the rice. I also added another half cup of cheese, but I don't think a little more would hurt. They taste even better the second day.","Yum yum! I've never made stuffed peppers before. These were great! I used ground turkey instead of beef b/c we're trying to eat healthier. Used Uncle Ben's converted Rice, in my opinion it is the best rice in a box. Used a large can of diced tomatoes, undrained. Did not even use tomato soup, I don't think you need to. After stuffing my peppers with the mixture, I just placed them right side up in a greased 9x13. Biggest tip - boil your peppers for a good 5 minutes in the beginning, before stuffing them, and make sure they are fully submerged beneath the water. If not, you will likely end up with pretty raw, crunchy peppers even after baking, unless you like to eat them that way. One of my peppers was like this, it was the one that never got submerged when boiling. The main thing I love about this recipe - you get your meat, starch, and green veggie all in one shot, and it is delicious and healthy! Thank you.",I don't like green peppers but hubby loves them so I had to give this a try. He raved about this one! I did add a tablespoon of minced garlic to the meat mixture and put grated sharp cheddar cheese on the tops of the peppers during the last five minutes of baking. I'll be making this one again for sure.,"This is a decent but very basic recipe. Here are my thoughts. First of all, don't cut the top off the pepper, it wastes too much pepper, cut it in half lengthwise. The beef and rice stuffing is rather bland. Easily liven it up by doubling (or more) the Worcestershire. Fresh garlic adds to it as well. Also, as others have already noted, adding some dried basil and/or oregano to the stuffing works well too. And why in the world would you buy a can of whole tomatoes and then chop them? Just use a can of diced tomatoes! Don't use soup as the topping. Use your favorite pasta sauce. But if you do use the tomato soup, don't add water, it will just dilute what little flavor there is. Simply pour the soup into a bowl, heat it a bit in the microwave and stir. Viola, there's the gravy consistency the recipe calls for and no water needed. After stuffing the pepper, ladle on the pasta sauce and then using a 2nd cup of cheese top each pepper. You can then top the cheese with a sprinkle of dried oregano or Italian seasoning. Happy eating!","I thought these were good but I have had better. Per previous reviews, I too added a bay leaf, a beef bullion cube and a tsp of oregano when cooking the rice. I also used sharp cheddar cheese. Although there is rice in the peppers, we served over additional white rice so we could spoon the sauce over all. Although we liked the meal, I feel it needs a little more ""umph"" to top it off. It has great potential and I will probally make again only I'll play around with it to find the right blend to fully satisfy our tastebuds.","This was wonderful! I couldn't remember how my mom made them, but this recipe turned out just like hers! I used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup (I didn't have any on hand), and I used a cup of corn instead of the cheese...it tasted just like home! Thanks Suzanne!","Regarding some of the reviews, why bother rating the recipe if your going to make a total change to the person posting the recipe. Either you like it or you don't. I dislike when people do that. Everyone puts their own spin on things. If your going to do that, then I suggest putting your OWN recipe up on the site and not criticize or change someone elses.","This is really close to my granmothers recipe but a whole lot more work! I don't pre-cook anything! Follow the instructions for prepping the peppers, combine the stuffing ingredients and lightly stuff the peppers, place in a dutch oven filled with soup/water combination, cover and simmer until peppers are soft and stuffing is cooked through. A lot less work and you're not lighting the oven! I usually make some extra meatballs out of the stuffing mix for those of us who don't like peppers. Served with mashed potatoes and the gravy from the peppers alongside cucumber salad and sweetcorn you've got a great meal!",I also added more seasoning. Be sure to slit a few holes in the bottom of the pepper so the fat runs out and doesn't lay in the bottom of the pepper.,"This recipe is pretty much the way I cook my stuffed peppers. But instead of putting the green peppers in boiling water, I found it was much easier to clean the green peppers, half them and put cut side down staggered on a glass plate and then microwaving them for 3 - 4 minutes on high. Then fill and bake! They turn out perfectly!","I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is a great base recipe that can be customized pretty easily. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the following changes. I sauteed some minced garlic with the ground beef and onion. I also had some bell pepper left over that I needed to use, so I chopped that up and sauteed that with the mixture as well. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (undrained) in place of the whole peeled tomatoes and doubled the Worcestershire. I used beef broth in place of the 1/2 cup of water and some Italian seasoning and some cayenne pepper for extra seasoning. For the cheese, I had a Cheddar Jack blend and made sure to sprinkle some on top during the last 5 minutes of baking. It was very tasty! The rice wasn't quite done after simmering in the beef mixture for 15 minutes, so next time I will cook the rice separately and add it at the end. Next time I'm also going to try wild rice for a little extra flavor.","My boyfriend and I just LOVE this stuffed bell pepper recipe... we did follow a few of the suggestions made by other reviewers and I think it adds up to the perfect dish: *Slice the peppers length wise and remove the seeds, and after boiling, sprinkle a little cheese inside each half *Double, or even triple the worcestershire *Use a can of diced tomatoes with the seasoning already added (we chose garlic and basil) *Cook the rice in beef or chicken broth in a separate pan, this helps ensure that the rice is tender and flavorful.. then add it to the beef and simmer for 5-10 mins so it all blends together *Add garlic to the beef and onions while cooking *Dont add water to the tomato soup, and make sure you sprinkle cheese on top of the peppers before baking! :) Delish!","OH my goodness. Everyone should ALWAYS cook rice before adding it to beef stuffings! Cabbage rolls, cook the rice first, stuffed peppers, cook the rice first. Always look at your ingredients first. If there is a ingredient that takes longer to cook than the main ing. cook it first, cool it before adding it to the main ing. so you dont start the cooking process before you pop it in the oven. Rate 4 stars","I have read a few of the reviews and noticed that everyone was baking the stuffed peppers. When I was younger my family cooked the stuffed peppers, standing up in tomatoe sauce (about half way up the pepper) in a large covered pot - just saying, its an alternative to par boiling them and they come out tender and delicious.","The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I made changes. 1. I use tomatoe sauce not soup, I add spices to it. 2. I used flavored diced tomatoes as well. 3. Instead of stuffing the peppers then pouring everything on top. I layer it. Cheese, meat, sauce. Until I get to the top. That way it's not dry. And of course I put a lot of cheese on top. My family and our friends LOVE them!","My wife and I have been making them this way for years, but when the kids were smaller they didn't like the green peppers and would leave them on the plates. We decided that was a waste so we chopped them into small pieces and put them in the sauce pan with the rest of the fixings. They never knew and ate every bit of it and asked for seconds..To this day when we have a family get together they will ask us to make this or our pizza sandwiches which is another story for another day!!!","Try using red peppers! They add a sweetness that is delicious. Substituting turkey in these is great. Lose some fat, but the taste is still great.","After 3-4 times preparing this recipe, I always use this one as a base, taking quite a few liberties, due to time constraints and family preferences. I parboil the peppers for 10 minutes. After slicing the tops off the peppers, I chop the remnants and sautee them along with my onions. I then brown 93/7 hamburger meat with our family's favorite spices (I also add considerably more than 1 tsp of worchestershire too!). I throw in a mixture of 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozzarella (or Italian blend or whatever else I have on hand) and mix that right into the warm meat mixture. I also cheat and use the 90-second Uncle Ben's Wild Rice pouch and mix that right into the hamburger/cheese mixture as well. I like a bit more structure and flavor to my sauce, so I use the Tomato Cream Sauce for Pasta, found on this site too. I then add a couple ladles of the sauce to the hamburger and blend well. It makes the hamburger/rice mixture just the perfect consistency to spoon into the peppers. Then, I pour the remaining sauce over the assembled peppers, add more cheese to the pepper tops and bake for 20 minutes (parboiling the peppers a bit longer will shorten your baking time). Easy peasy...not to mention wonderfully delicious! This is a great recipe to add your flair to since you can sub out different colored peppers, use ground turkey instead of hamburger meat, play around with sauces, etc. Thanks for the submission....I'll use this recipe as my base over and over again.","I also use tomato paste rather than tomatoes, also tomato soup is too sweet so I use tomato juice if needed. We don't like green peppers so I use red, orange or yellow, they're sweeter and not so ""bitey"". After stuffing the peppers, my mom always just put them in the skillet, topped them with more cheese, the tomato juice and cooked them covered till heated through. No baking required. She also added basil, parsley and garlic to the beef mixture. She made these for over 65 years, and her mother before her so she had time to perfect the recipe.","Delicious! I cut recipe in half, used ground turkey and much seasoning. Minced garlic and two huge yellow peppers. Sprinkled shredded Mexican cheese mix. A hit with my husband. Thanks!","I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because the tips from other reviewers seemed to improve the recipe drastically. Bottom line: The peppers were excellent! From others' suggestions, I added two cloves of garlic (chopped); added lots of Italian seasoning, plus more basil and oregano; used diced, canned tomatoes flavored with basil and oregano; doubled the Worchestershire; substituted spaghetti sauce for tomato soup; doubled the rice and cooked it ahead of time; used some red peppers as well as green ones; and used at least 1.5 cups of grated cheddar. The 60-minute time frame is conservative, especially if you make it the way I did. Cooking the rice alone took 20 minutes; I had to cook two batches of peppers; browning the beef took about 15 minutes; and the peppers cooked in the oven at least 35 minutes. All in all, a great basic recipe, easily adapted to what you have on hand and what your family prefers. I'll definitely make these again.","I made my stuffed peppers like this when I first started cooking but now that I've gotten back to eating healthier, I've lightened it up a bit. We don't like green bell peppers so I use red, orange or yellow. I now use ground turkey, fire-roasted tomatoes, brown rice that I've cooked before hand and I omit the water. I also use organic tomato sauce and throw in a mess of minced fresh garlic. This totally bends well to what I have on hand and if I want to make it stretch with half the meat, I sub in shredded or chopped veggies (we favor zucchini, carrots, spinach or broccoli) and sometimes I'll spice it up with a teaspoon or two of homemade italian seasoning or taco seasoning. Whatever I grab first. This is always a filling meal that my family always inhales. If you've got the time and patience, this is also a good recipe to double and freeze one container for another time.","We love this recipe and I did not change a thing. I was low on green pepper once when i made this so I chopped up what I had and made a casserole and it turned out just as good. Thanks for the great easy recipe, I will make again and again","I try out new recipes from online sites almost every week. Though I have tried probably hundreds of recipes, I have only written a couple of reviews because though most recipes are ok, none are sooo good or sooo bad to warrant a review. But this stuffed pepper recipe is an exception. It is fabulous. I thought I had a good stuffed pepper recipe but this one is much better. If your family likes stuffed peppers, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",,,,,,,,

84,"I made this stroganoff several times and it has now become a staple fancy dish! My boyfriend (now husband 7/2006) claims this is his all time favorite dish that I make. Over time I made a few modifications to this recipe: (1) Marinate the meat in red or white wine for 1-2 hrs in the fridge prior to cooking. This adds a really nice flavor to the beef and tenderizes the meat, and you can skip the addition of the wine at the end as this can thin out the sauce. (2) Use 1 medium yellow onion (sliced or chopped) and use the green onions for garnish instead. (3) Garlic is a must (be liberal unless you are on a date)! (4) Corn starch works just as well as flour or you can also use 2 tbsp of each. I found it easier to dissolve them in a few tbsp of beef broth before adding it to the skillet otherwise it's really difficult to dissolve flour/corn starch in the sauce. (5) Add 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce along with the prepared mustard. (6) Add two cans (4 oz each) of sliced mushrooms and simmer with the beef instead of at the end of cook time. Fresh sliced mushrooms (8 oz) work well also. (7) Add 1/3 cup cream cheese and 1/3 cup sour cream that the end--trust me this is key!! TIP: found it VERY difficult to push aside the browned meat and then cook the onions and add the flour to the skillet the first few times I made this. Instead, I now remove the browned meat to a plate, cook the onion by itself, and then return the meat back to the pan and add broth with dissolved flour/starch.",This was the best beef stroganoff I've ever had! I did marinate the beef in red wine. I also used yellow onions instead of the green onions. I did also add 1 TBSP. minced garlic. I added 2 TBSP of cornstarch to the beef broth before adding it to the pan and cut the flour to 2 TBSP. I found it easier to take the meat and onions out while thickening the sauce and then adding them back to the pan. I let this simmer for about an hour and a half and the meat was really tender. I think you could put it in a crock pot too and that would be delicious. At the end I added 1/3 c. cream cheese and 1/3 c. sour cream and omitted the white wine since I marinated in red. The cream cheese was a great addition which I saw from another reviewer. It was absolutely delicious!!! My 17 month old daughter loved it. This will be a staple in our home.,"""I'm speechless. I'm actionless. All i can do is sit here and revel in how good this is!"" Direct quote from husband. We did follow the suggestions of other reviewers: omitted butter (used non-stick frying pan) for healthier meal; used sirloin instead of beef chuck; added 1 Tbs. Worchestershire sauce; added two garlic cloves; used 1 diced yellow onion instead of green onions; and used fresh mushrooms.","Perfect without any changes as far as I am concerned. I don't rate recipes a 5 if they need changing to be right. As for the food snob that thinks if a home cook can make it it only deserves 3 stars....get a life! Some of us have other things to do other than wreck a simple recipe by fooling around all day trying to be a ""chef"". Simple is often better. This is delicious and doesn't taste like a ""simple"" recipe. Don't be put off by the snobs!","This is fantastic!!! I’ve used this recipe for Stroganoff several times with only minor changes … used fresh (sautéed) mushrooms and eliminated the white wine (because it thinned the sauce too much) and my family has always enjoyed it. But, after reading some of the reviews, I decided to try marinating the beef (sirloin) in red wine for a couple of hours and added a chopped clove of garlic (at the same time the green onions were added). These two changes along with using the fresh mushrooms have made this an absolute family favorite.","This is some of the best beef stroganoff ever! I used sirloin instead of chuck roast and let that marinate in red wine, garlic, and Worcestershire for two hours before cooking. I cooked that then plated it. I used a combination of green onions and vidalia, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire, white wine and minced garlic. After I added the meat back in I reserved a bit of the broth to mix with 2 Tbsp. of corn starch. I added that to thicken then added the sour cream and a bit of cream cheese. This was fabulous served over egg noodles - YUM!","Mercy! This one offers up a most incredible flavor, a unique combination of down-home and exotic. The recipe as written is no doubt wonderful, but I improvised a bit based on experience, instinct and what I had available. I followed suggestion of marinating the beef in red wine. Then, because the wine permeated the dish all through, because of the beef marinade, I didn't add the white wine in at the end. I also added 1/3 cup of cream cheese as recommended by other reviewers. That part was fine, but I'm not so sure the extra calories are worth it. I didn't detect a significant difference in the flavor pre cream cheese to post cream cheese. I used real mushrooms, not canned. That is highly recommended. I sauteed the mushrooms with the green onions and removed them from the skillet to the same bowl where I rested the beef. Too, I used light sour cream. Hey, there is enough richness in the recipe, using light sour cream will not make one iota of difference. I served the recipe on packaged noodles. I'll try rice next time. Even my picky wife, who shuns flavors that depart from basic meat and potatoes--especially dishes involving wine--said she ""loved it.""","Absolutely Wonderful! As suggested by previous cooks, I marinated the beef in a white wine for a few hours and then didn't add any wine at the end (used a little extra broth instead). I used a whole yellow onion instead of the green. It seemed like a lot of onion and I was nervous at first, but after an hour of simmering, they practically diappeared. Just before the hour of simmering, I added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp of worcheschire sauce, and 1/2 tsp of Jack Daniels mustard. It was sooo good! It was slightly difficult mixing it all in one pan, but it all turned out great! It made just enough for 2 large helpings, and an extra bowl for leftovers tomorrow!","GREAT recipe! I have made stroganoff over and over before trying this recipe and never gotten it right. This time, for the first time, it worked. I did use sherry instead of wine, *fresh* mushrooms, and beef bouillion, not stock. But is was YUMMY! Great recipe even for a klutz like me!","This recipe is okay. There is a beef stroganoff recipe on the back of the Campbells beef broth can that is so much better (and easier!). The mustard gives it great flavor, but to me the butter is overkill. It's just too much. I cut the amount of butter down and you were still able to taste it. I used top sirloin instead of chuck roast, added 1T of worcestshire sauce, and it turned out better. I didn't have green onions, so I didn't add those. Also, I skipped simmering it for an hour. I just brown the meat, then do the rest immediately. It turned out fine! Also, to avoid the flour clumping situation, don't add it directly to the skillet. I mixed it with the beef broth in a bowl, then added the mixture to the skillet. Overall, it's an okay recipe, but I think I'll stick to the Campbells one.","This was absolutely amazing. I admit that I am not a huge stroganoff fan, but my husband loves the stuff. So, I figured for a treat I would make it for him...now I loved this dish. I followed the recipe almost exactly, only thing done differently was to add a bit of garlic to the meat while browning. It gave wonderful flavor. Cooked wonderfuly...a must try.","BRILLIANT! Didn't have green onions (sub: 1 normal onion), condensed broth (sub: normal broth), or canned mushrooms (sub: fresh mushrooms). Turned out spectacular! Was great with a side of mashed potatoes. EDIT: Found all the correct ingredients, and it was still perfect. Though I kept the fresh muchrooms insread of canned.","I hate it when people do this...but I changed this recipe quite a bit. Browned beef and onions with the addition of 2 cloves of minced garlic. Why in the world would anyone who enjoys food use canned mushrooms?? I added an 8 ou. package of sliced baby bellas sauteed in 1 tbls of butter and added at the end. Do yourself a favor and mix the flour in with the broth and ""wisk"" with a fork otherwise there are giant flour clumps in your future. Added a tsp of worcesteshire sauce to the browning beef. Increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup light sour cream. I used a tender piece of meat however, if you're using a tougher piece you may want to include the wine earlier as this not only enhances flavor...the acid helps to break down tough meat cuts and makes them tender. I chose dijon mustard as my prepared mustard because of it's wine content. Also I used a TBL of butter to saute the meat and one to saute the mushrooms. 4 ounces would be waaayyy to much! This is a solid three star recipe made as is...its a five star with the changes I have made.","Great recipe, used a few tips and tricks from other reviewers (thank you JJH), as well as a few of my own. Here's what I did: - Used a large yellow onion, I feel you get more/better flavor from it as opposed to a green onion. - I also used a healthy amount of garlic (2 cloves if you're trying to be conservative, more if you're like me). Add it after your onions are nice and soft; garlic burns quickly! - I hate canned mushrooms; way too slimy! I bought some regular ol' button mushrooms, sliced 'em, and added them to the pan with the onions. This method worked well! - Marinating the beef in the red wine is also key (for no more than a couple of hours)! You get some amazing flavor from it! Don't forget to omit the white wine at the end. - Instead of adding the flour in separately, do yourself a favor...before you brown your beef, dredge it with some flour. Just enough to give each piece a light coating. You're going to get better flavor and its a sure fire way to ensure your sauce doesn't end up lumpy. Also, you're going to end up with some bonus pan drippings, that you'll deglaze with the beef broth! - I strongly suggest, please for the love of god, use a couple splashes of worcestershire when you add the mustard. I promise you won't regret the amount of rich flavor you're adding! - I used half sour cream and half cream cheese at the end. The cream cheese brings the really nice creamy velvety texture, and the sour cream brings flavor to the party! Hope this is helpful!","I just love it when we find the recipe we've been searching for! After a few Stroganoff mishaps during my search, my husband was not looking forward to dinner tonight. Three helpings later; we've found our family Stroganoff! This is EXACTLY like my grandmother's! I can NOT believe how tender the chuck roast came out. We're flavor-hounds; so I added some crushed dried herbs (oregano, tarragon, chives)to the meat, sauteed fresh sliced button mushrooms with the onions (I also used some green of the onions), and added a touch more wine and used 5 ounces of sour cream. Over buttered egg noodles sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley? Heaven. Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe.","Delicious dinner. And you don't have to use chuck roast either. I think I used sirloin strips last time and it was really good. I also omit the wine, and it still tastes fine! Great recipe!",Added Parsley and Sour Cream Just Before Serving. Use 96/4 Ground Beef. Modified it for Crock Pot by adding all ingredients other than parsley and Sour Cream at the beginning (white wine was added at the beginning to the crock pot with other ingredients.) Cook on low 4-5 hours.,"Crockpot version: chop 1 medium onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Place in crockpot with browned beef and add beef broth, mustard and 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce. Cook on low 6-8 hrs. I added cornstarch (dissolved in cool water) about an hour before done to thicken. Add 1/3 c each sour cream and cream cheese about 1/2 hour before done. Salt & pepper for taste. Amazing!!","Loved this! I hated, hated, hated Stroganoff growing up!(sorry mom, who is a great cook by the way) I made this for my husband who likes Stroganoff & what a surprise! This was really good! The only thing I changed was that I used fresh mushrooms, which I added about 45 minutes into cooking.(meant to add garlic but forgot)The meat was so tender & cooked perfectly. The wine really adds to this recipe. Might make alittle extra gravy next time, since it's so good on the rice and/or noodles. Great recipe, Thanks!","OMGosh! This is wonderful! I use chuck roast for a lot of things (including stir fry's, fajiata's, and ect), it's a wonderful cut of meat and I learned it's very economical while raising my 3 kids that were in sports and ate like 6 kids instead of 3 That's why I chose this recipe to try. It was great the first time.. I wouldn't complain a bit. The 2nd time I made it I used beef consumme' instead of broth. 1 small vidalia onion and half the green onions... and I doubled the mushrooms, because I love them! This recipe is terrific all by itself... but it's also a great adaptable recipe for your own taste. Add parsley, rosemary, thyme? It's up to you.. it's a terrific recipe! I serve it over homemade or kluski noodles. And I love extra black pepper so it's always on the table. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!","Great as is, BUT it can be made even more delicious w/ a few changes. Double the broth, I use 2 cans and it makes it so much better. I then also double the sour cream. The roast is fine, but to cut down on prep time I use stew beef and it is perfectly tender after the 1 hr. simmer time. Lastly I use 2 tsp spicy brown mustard instead of one tsp. yellow. Word to the wise... temper the sour cream by whisking in about 1/4 c. of the simmering sauce before adding it to the pan. It prevents those white lumps/bits. This is THE stroganoff recipe for me and I have been asked for it often! Yummy!!!","I used a large yellow onion instead of green onions (that's what I had on hand) and fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned. I didn't add the extra salt and I threw in a teaspoon each of dried basil and dried oregano. I didn't realize until after I'd cleaned up after dinner that I'd spaced the mustard--we didn't miss it. I served this over buttered thick egg noodles. Out of the whole pan full, a small bowl remains. We loved it. NOTE: The beef broth I used was a full can of Campbell's condensed beef broth.","This recipe is very, very good! I followed by advises of previous postings: instead of green, I put one yellow onion; not 1/3 cup of sour cream, but 1/2 and 1 oz of cream cheese to it; 1 tbsp of Worchestershire sauce. Very tasty! Very reach! Couple years ago I tried beef stroganoff with a little of mustard seeds. I liked combination of reach, creamy sauce and crunchiness of “little suckers”:-). Next time I definitely put mustard seeds maybe 10 min before cooked time. I try to watch my weight, so I put reduced fat both sour cream and cream cheese. It came out great! You would never tell!","It would be a 5 but b/c I also marinated the beef strips in white wine, I had to give it a 4. WONDERFUL & BEST stroganoff recipe I've ever made. For 46 years I've made Betty Crocker's Simple Beef Stroganoff for Two & now I'm switching to Donna's Beef Stroganoff III recipe. Thank you!!!","This is our favorite recipe for beef stroganoff. What I did: To reduce cooking time and make it a nicer meal use cubed Rib Eye beef steak and maranateed the steak for 2 hours in a mixture of 1/2-1 cup of beef broth, 1/4-1/2 cup of Red Wine, and a teaspoon of mustard. Then I sauteed the beef in butter but only used 1/2 stick of butter and 2 cloves of garlic, and a tiny bit of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Once the meat was almost brown I put a 1/2 cup of red wine into the pan and increased the heat to med. high. I waited about 2 minutes for the alcohol to burn off (when it's smoking and smells less like alcohol and more like flavor) and added the onions and beef broth and 2 teaspoons of corn starch. It's easier to mix the corn starch and 1/4th cup of beef broth in a separate mixture. I also added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and omitted the mushrooms since we don't like the texture of mushrooms but enjoy the flavor. I added the rest of the beef broth, about 1 and 1/2 cup until it was the consistency I liked. I also spiced to my liking (thyme, sage, pepper, salt, cumin, a shake of nutmeg) and the teaspoon of mustard. I needed to add a tiny bit of milk because it was still a bit goopy and thick and I didn't want it to burn on the bottom of the pan. Then I covered it and simmered for about 20 minutes while I boiled the water and prepared the egg noodles. I checked the pan every 7 minutes or so to ensure that it was simmering on low and that it wasn't sticking/burning to the bottom.","Our kids are married and gone so you know how many times I struggle with ""whats for dinner"" after 37 years of marriage..Well, I made this for dinner last night and my husband LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this recipe. I have made Beef Stroganoff many times but (apparently) it never tasted like this recipe... Not only will I make it again, this receipe will go into the FAV. Box","Thanks for sharing this, Donna! I just made it for the first time, and it will be replacing my previous favorite stroganoff recipe of many years. I used the popular suggestions of adding a couple splashes of worcestshire, as well as 1 tbsp. of minced garlic (from a jar - milder than fresh). I did encounter a small problem. The sauce was extremely thick and there wasn't much of it, and it constantly threatened to burn on the bottom during the hour-long simmer. This was avoided by stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot every 5-10 minutes, and adding a little water each time to replace what was lost by lifting the lid. After that, I added the wine (a white zinfandel) and 12 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms (I love mushrooms, and the canned type are *not* allowed in my kitchen! :) I continued simmering until the mushrooms were tender, and the juices they produced helped to extend and thin the sauce, which was much needed in my opinion. I then removed from heat and stirred in the sour cream. Simply incredible, packed with flavor, and the beef was so tender! Though next time, I will try adding extra liquid at the beginning in an attempt to make it better behaved - I felt like I was flirting with disaster making this; had I not been attentive, it could have easily burned beyond rescue. A bit more sour cream would also be welcomed by my palette, although another popular suggestion to add 1/3 cup softened cream cheese sounds quite delicious also.","A great stroganoff recipe with a little zip. I didn't think it was a lot of work at all. Once the meat is cut and trimmed of fat, it's smooth sailling. I used yellow onions instead of green and fresh mushrooms in place of canned. I'll add garlic next time around. The flavor was phenomenal and the meat was tender. My family gobbled up every morsel. I'll make this again.",,,,,,,,
85,"Perfect! Followed the recipe to a T and it was great. There were a TON of leftovers. I used a 5 pound roast. I put some of the extra meat in the fridge for later and still had a lot of leftover meat. I filled my muffin pan with scoops of meat. Each individual muffin tin holds the same as a typical sandwich. I put the muffin tin in the freezer and froze the individual serving size leftovers. After about 2 hours I took the tin out removed the meat muffins. Next they went into a ziploc and they will not all stick together. To reheat just pop one in the microwave on 50% power. These are great for a quick sandwich, with rice, with beans, or with eggs.","Absolutely delicious!!! I would give this one 10 stars! I cooked on low for 10 hours, then shredded and kept it on warm for a couple more hours. I am seriously keeping this recipe forever. This is the perfect weekend bbq/potluck food, and went great with grilled corn on the cob and red potato salad. Also, when you shred the meat you can remove most of the fat. I think you could do without the oil. I used kraft honey bbq sauce - just what I had on hand. SOOOO tasty. You can't stop eating this.","I pulled 40 lbs. of pork using this recipe for my son's graduation party. I also froze it before reheating it in crockpots. I received many compliments. It turned out much more moist than the root beer recipe I tried earlier. I did serve BBQ on the side, but I'm not sure it needed it.","I love this recipe! I've made it several times and everyone always goes crazy for it. I use a 6-7 lb. bone-in shoulder. I've used a deboned and a bone-in and the bone-in definitely comes out a little tastier. I leave out the oil and the chicken broth, because I think the broth makes it too juicy and I just don't think the oil is necessary. Instead, I just put in the entire bottle of barbeque sauce. I use like 10 cloves of garlic and a huge vidalia onion. You don't have to bother chopping up the onions or garlic too small because by the time it's done, they're all dissolved. I put in closer to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 8 or so drops of Liquid Smoke, two tablespoons of chili powder and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. In my opinion, and I think everyone I've fed this to would agree, the cinnamon is KEY. It makes it SO GOOD and adds such a depth of flavor. The recipe doesn't mention this, but make sure you put the roast in the slow cooker fat side up so it can drip down into the meat while it cooks. I cook it on low overnight for about 12 hours, then pull it and remove all the fat, strain the liquid and add it all back to the cooker for another 4 hours or so. The leftovers really do taste better every day. Make sure to make a semi-sweet southern slaw to go along with it - HEAVEN! ;)","Made this with a 6 lb. pork loin roast I had bought on reduced for quick sale. I followed the ingredients increased for my size of roast, except for using dry mustard in lieu of prepared and adding liquid smoke. I cooked on high two hours and then low for seven. I took the meat out and it shredded with complete ease two hours before serving, then placed back in the crockpot. There was alot of liquid and needed to reduce a good two cups worth after placing the shredded meat back in the crockpot. Added a bit of BBQ sauce and liquid smoke at that point to give the meat a bit more flavor, even though it was tender, still lacked that BBQ flavor. After another two hours this was the best tasting pork I've evern made in the slow cooker. Our guest even requested to take home some for lunch the next day. I'm not sure I'd add the broth next time, I feel the fat in the meat made plenty of juice. *Note when placing meat in crockpot, always leave the fat side on top so the juices sink down into the meat while cooking...read that somewhere.","I was so excited to try this, but ended up a little disappointed. Although it was very easy to get together and the pork turned out perfectly and just fell apart, the taste just wasn't doing it for me. It was way too sweet for me, I was hoping for more of that smoky flavor. If I make this again I won't be adding any sugar, maybe more vinegar and maybe some liquid smoke to give it that pulled pork flavor.",Good flavor. Estimated cooking time was about right. The only change I made was omitting the thyme as I don't like the flavor with pork. I'll definitely make it again.,This is amazingly good!! The roast I had was 8 pounds and this recipe easily doubled in my large oval crock pot!! We had lots of leftovers which we froze....and it was just as good after freezing!!,"This is an excellent recipe. My family loved it and it quickly disappeard. I used a 2 1/2 pound pork roast and it turned out perfect. I have tried to find a good recipe for pulled pork for years. My search is over, this is it!","HOLY COW! I put this roast in the slow cooker for a full 24 hours, on Low the entire time. I turned at 4 hours and again at 12 (although at 12, it just fell apart and continued to do so throughout the day). At the end of the 24 hours, the meat was dark brown from soaking up sauce and the most incredibly rich, moist, tangy and delicious BBQ that I have ever had in my entire life. It was so juicy and delicious that we didn't even need any extra sauce or additions. I can't believe how amazing this was. Would HIGHLY recommend cooking for a full 24 hours on low if you can plan it that way. Great with beef roast, too!","LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I doubled because I had an 8-9 lb. roast. I did everything according to recipe EXCEPT I didn't use oil (NO NEED!), and no chicken broth (no room & no need!), AND no Thyme as I AM NOT A LOVER, Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy (because this is the BEST for pulled pork), placed onion slices on the bottom of crock pot, placed my large roast on top of onions, mixed all the other ingredients in a bowl and poured over roast turning several times to coat. Made sure fat side of roast was on top! Set Crock Pot for 10 hours, after 5 hours removed pork and shredded, removed bone, placed everything back in sauce, covered and cooked for 7 hours longer (ended up being a total of 12+ hours~the longer the BETTER! YUM, YUM, YUM!! Served with Greek Pasta Salad (made the day prior), corn on the cobb and apple sauce. Definitely toasted the buttered buns (which is a GREAT touch) and my family ages 8 to 54 GOBBLED IT UP!!! I always make much more so I have leftovers (even better the next day), and extra to freeze as well (for a later date). THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE. I have made pulled pork several different ways and I NOW think that this is my NEW FAVORITE!! LOVE LOVE, and THANKS AGAIN! HAVE A FULFILLING DAY! :)","Excellent recipe. I made this for a pot luck at work and it was a huge hit! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but did not use the chili powder (I was out). I seasoned the meat with Famous Dave's Rib Rub and added a tsp of liquid smoke. I cooked it for 8 hours. The meat was falling apart, I had a hard time getting it out of the crockpot to pull it apart. There was a lot of liquid left so I ladled some over the pulled meat and discarded the rest. Served on rolls with Serbian syle coleslaw. DELICIOUS!!","This is AWESOME! This will be my go-to recipe for pulled pork from now on. The only change I made was omitting the oil as I just couldn't see the need for it and reduced the thyme to a little less than a teaspoon. After shredding the meat, I poured the liquid into a measuring cup which separates the grease from the other liquid, then poured about half of the liquid back in with the meat. There will be a LOT of liquid, which is fine, but you don't need that much in the end. Try this! You will not be disappointed!","Very good pulled pork. My problem was the sauce was too runny I couldn't really taste the flavor of the sauce and the flavor didn't stick to the meat. My solution..after the pork was removed and shreded, I dissolved 2 TBSP corn startch in 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar and added it to the sauce. It thickened right up so the flavor (which was amazing once thickened)actually stuck to the meat. It was the first time my husband asked for seconds when I made pulled pork.",Very good! I did add a few more garlic cloves and warmed up extra BBQ sauce as an extra dipping sauce.,"10 stars would be a better rating for this one. We absolutely LOVED this pulled pork. The flavors are perfectly balanced. The cider vinegar is a must for this type of pulled pork, so don't leave it out. When you add the pork back to the slow cooker, it soaks up all that flavorful slow-cooked juice and is just divine. Do put it back in, you'll be glad that you did. Didn't change any of the ingredients, cooked on low for 10 hours, and look forward to homemade pulled pork many more times in the future. Hubster said it is THE best pulled pork he's ever had in his life. He is a big fan of pulled pork, so that says a lot. Thanks so much for sharing this stellar recipe! :)",First off this is the most amazing pork i have ever had. I used a 8 lb pork shoulder bone in much better flavor when the meat has the bone in it. I doubled the recipe i didn't use the oil which is not needed because the fat from the meat makes the sauce oily enough also didn't use thyme because i just don't care for it. cooking times i changed based on how big the meat was i cooked it for 7hrs on high then another 3hrs on low and omg it was falling apart amazing tenderness when i took it out it was already shredding it was so tender. couple things i would recommend is place the dice onions on the bottom and place the meat on it to avoid having the meat touch the bottom. also make sure u place the meat fat side up to so that way the fat drips into the sauce. another big thing is the sauce will be oily u cant fix this because the meat is fatty dont trim the fat first because it keeps it moist while in the slow cooker also i didnt sear it first either the fat is easily removed when u shred it. to avoid the oily sauce once it was done i placed a whole bottle of bbq in the pot and returned the meat to sauce all shredded and kept on the keep warm setting for 20 min then served makes a huge difference next daythe sauce will thicken also the bbq i used was called dinosaur bbq original. i used the meat for tacos and the next day for sandwiches enjoy this recipe its awesome and remember dont be discouraged from the oily sauce after it will happen since the meat is fatty,"This recipe was great and a big hit with my dinner guests! )if they only knew how EASY it was!). I left out the mustard (somehow missed it when I wrote down the recipe) and the onion (didn't have one). Still was a great recipe. I will follow it to the ""T"" next time! Thanks!!!!",I really like this! I thought it had a great flavor. I have only made pulled pork with the ready made mixes and liked this so much better. I will be using this again! Thanks for the recipe!,"This recipe is the BOMB! Like many folks...this was my first time cooking a pork shoulder. The oly changes: 1-DO NOT add veggy oil. Are you crazy! Pork always makes its own oil. 2-1/2 can of beer instead of broth. 3-I smoked my meat for 1.5 hrs with a charcoal grill and hickory wood chips. 4-5lbs TRIMMED pork shoulder (I would suggest trimmed to reduse amount of oil) 5-2 heads of garlic (1 head crushed in pot when slow cooking. 1 head inserted in meat when smoking. 6-Remove meat from pot to shred (drain ""juice"" before putting meat back in pot. Add sauce along with the onions and garlic from the juice back to pot. Add juice accordingly...I like my pork not to jucy). 7-Enjoy.",Made exactly as written. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and for me the key to these sandwiches is a little extra BBQ sauce piled on top. It was a hit at the party I threw...no leftovers!,"Made this for superbowl sunday and it was a hit with everyone! I read a ton of reviews and since everyone said it was watery and too sweet I made a few changes to remedy this...I used half of the cider vinegar & half the chicken broth, and doubled the BBQ Sauce (1.5 cups - half Sweet Baby Ray's and half a Hickory Smoke BBQ sauce). Cooked on low 12 hrs. I still had to reduce it quite a bit after taking the meat out (I did this in 2 batches), but not a big deal since it reduced within a few mins. With these changes it's a definite 5 star recipe.","Excellent recipe.I used a 6.5 lb Boston butt and cooked it on low for about 9 hrs.Took out the meat ,removed as much fat as possible as I was shredding it. wrapped the meat separately and chilled the remaining meat juices in a pot overnight in the fridge.The fat solidified and I was able to remove it all!Then added some Sweet Baby Ray and Wahoo sauce to the liquid and then used a stick blender to smooth out the sauce.Added the meat back to the sauce and put it in the fridge overnight to intensify the flavor in the meat.Served on toasted sandwich buns -yum!!!",Very good. And easy. Use a quality barbeque sauce. I like mine on the spicy side but live with someone that likes bbq sauce sweeter so. He wins. Could use some salt and pepper IMO.,"I have made this recipe 3 times now. What I like to do after I have shredded the meat is add it to a hot skillet with some olive oil and brown it a little bit. I think it really brings out the flavor of the meat better. After it is brown (takes about 5-10 minutes, stir it a lot) I take a few ladles of the sauce from the crock pot and add them to the skillet. I butter and toast fresh bakery buns (Bollilo or Bratwurst) instead of commericially packaged hamburger buns. I like to add a slice of American cheese and a Claussen pickle slab and voila! Culinary AWESOMENESS!","Pulled pork is something not seen around these parts but having seen it on different cookings shows, we thought we would give it a try. We found this to be an awesome meal. Didn't have buns so just ate it on a plate with some Dijon mustard on it and a side of homemade cabbage rolls. Lots of leftovers, so definitely will buy some buns and try that way with some cole slaw. Thanks, cmcreight.",,,,,,,,,,
86,"This recipe is delicious and easy! For a slightly healthier fish bake the mahi-mahi, because that works too.","YUMMY!!! I boiled the sauce and put more over fish. I grilled by putting double layer of tin foil on grill and forming a boat by folding up side. Grilled for exactly 8 mins, this method works for any fish and keeps it from sticking. No need to even flip the fish just shut the lid and leave for 8 mins. This works for any fish less then 1 inch thick. I also used frozen Mahi Mahi from Sams and let completely defrost.","Really, Really, Really good stuff. The only change was dried ginger instead of the fresh (didn't have any on hand). I also added just a bit more honey after. I baked the fish instead of pan frying (for the health factor) and reduced the sauce in a pan and poured over the fish. Really liked how this turned out. Thanks for the post.","Loved this recipe overall!!! Once I get a feel for the main recipe, I like to play with the ingredients. My adjustments to your already great sauce are for personal preference only: 2 T. balsamic vinegar, 2 t. freshly grated ginger, 1 t. fresh key/Mexican lime or Meyers lemon juice (sweeter than regular lime or lemon juice). As a variation, I add a smidgeon (1/8 t.+/-) of garlic/chili sauce (can be found in Asian food section of most grocery stores) because we enjoy a little heat. To highlight the fish, I usually serve it over a fluffy rice, flecked with bits of color such as minced cilantro, mint, or parsley, grated carrot or citrus peel and add a bright green veggie such as asparagus, green beans, or broccoli.","I've made this a few times now and I've made a couple changes to suit our tastes. I doubled the ginger and garlic. I placed the fish and marinade in a casserole dish, let it sit in the fridge 20 mins, then put the casserole dish in the over and baked it for 20 mins at 400. It's good pan-fried too, but baking it cooks it evenly so it stays juicy and really soaks up the marinade. Also I find the oil spits and makes a huge mess when made in the pan. Delish and no mess after!",OMG!! This is incredible! I am eating it right now as I am rating it. I scaled it down to 2 portions and used the frozen mahi mahi filets from Costco. I also used dried ginger as I didn't have the fresh. I will be making this often. Thanks for the post!!,"I just have to say that if anyone rated this below 4 stars they did not prepare it correctly. (also unfair to rate recipes poorly because you burned it) I found the directions and all the ingredients perfect! This made a fabulous mahi salad. I used the glaze as the dressing over a medley of lettuce, yellow bell peppers, red onion and fresh broccoli. The best tasting 6 WW points I ever ate. Thanks Diana!","We really enjoyed this. I grilled the Mahi Mahi rather than pan frying and it was superb. The marinade/glaze is definately versatile enough to be used on shrimp, chicken, pork, and even beef.","This was fabulous!!!! I am still thinking about it four days later. Even my kids and husband who do not like fish, loved this dish. I used crystallized ginger instead of fresh and it turned out perfect. Served with a sauteed mixture of green beans, sugar snap peas and mushrooms. Placed the mahi mahi on top of the veggies. Also used the frozen mahi mahi available at Sams Club.",Served this for a dinner party and it was fabulous. I would double the marinade to have more sauce to pour over the finished dish. Very easy. Would use over chicken or pork also,"This was very simple to prepare and yummy! The little ones even liked it! The sauce reminds me of a ginger sauce served at my favorite restaurant! I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used 1½ tbls of cider vinegar. Also, I didn't have fresh ginger root so I used ½ tsp of ground ginger. I managed to slightly burn mine but it still turned out yummy. I will definitely make this again. I will just start frying at a lower temperature next time. :)","I had never cooked mahi mahi before, but we had it on a recent trip to Havana and decided to give it a whirl. This was a very good recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the fish for a few hours, baked it (saving the marinade) at 400 degrees F. for 20 minutes and cooked/reduced the reserved marinade until thickened and poured it over the baked fish. It was delicious, and we are making the recipe again for company this week-end.","Fantastic flavor! One of the easiest fish recipes I have ever made. Love it! I'm making it for the second time tonight! My balsamic vinegar is pretty sweet, and I like a lower glycemic index sweetener, so to make it a bit less sweet, more sour and to add a bit of heat, I used agave nectar instead of honey, added a bit of key lime juice, and some habanero chili sauce. Tip for the ginger: keep a piece of ginger root in your freezer. When you need fresh ginger, you can easily break off a piece, peel it and grate it, all while still frozen, and it's way easier than when it's not frozen.","This is fabulous. Even my husband, who doesn't like fish unless it is battered and fried liked this. I doubled the sauce / marinade and added about a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce. I had a lot left over. Next time rather than just cooking and reducing the sauce I will thicken with corn starch. I sprinkled the fish with sesame seeds and baked the marinated fish for 10 minutes at 450. Garnished with fresh cut chives. An amazing....light meal. BTW, I served this with jasmine rice, cold sesame noodle salad and a creamy cabbage salad. (All left overs from another meal.) It was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!","Mmmmm! Made the marinade per the recipe then reserved a few tablespons for basting, which was plenty because we only needed 2 mahi mahi filets. Let it marinate 1-1/2 hours then grilled for about 8-10 minutes. Did not add salt, I think some of the folks who found this salty may have seasoned their filets but it's NOT necessary or advisable to do so, just a bit of fresh ground pepper but please do not add any salt! Was NOT overpowering for the delicately flavored Mahi, just DON'T marinate too long, & would be a great marinade/glaze on other fish as well...The hubs usually dislikes any meat or seafood with a flavor profile anywhere near the sweeter side but he loved this & we definitely will make it again & again! Oh & one more thing - use only FRESH ginger!!! PLEASE DO NOT SUBSTITUTE GROUND GINGER - IT IS NOT THE SAME!!!","Don't bother to fry! Baked is better. I doubled this recipe and I fried half as the recipe states, then I baked the rest in the oven at 400 about 20 minutes. The baked really brought out all of the flavors. I suggest you use the fresh ginger root, it really added to the flavor and consistency of this dish. I used Tilapia because my store was out of Mahi Mahi and it was great! I love the taste and this will go into heavy rotation in my house.","This was excellent. Instead of frying however, I left the Mahi Mahi in the marinade and baked it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes.","Really, Really good. I made it exactly as written, using only 1-2 tsp of oil in a non-stick pan to sautee. Served with steamed green beans and coconut rice. Everyone loved it. Yum!","I really wanted to like this, but I didn't enjoy it very much. My DH gave it 4 stars and I gave it 2.",My fiance and I both loved this recipe. I used ground ginger because it was on hand but I think fresh ginger would be even better next time. I pan-fried mine in sunflower oil. It turned out perfectly and I will keep this in rotation.,"fantastic! i changed a few things based on what i had on hand: white vinegar, ground ginger, and sesame oil instead of balsamic vinegar, fresh ginger, and olive oil, respectively. and i baked it at 425 for 25 minutes. i also took the marinade and simmered it while the fish was baking, then poured the reduction over the fish after it was finished. mmmm...","We loved the ginger glaze for the mahi mahi. Yes, it comes out very dark, almost black, but that is to be expected when dealing with soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. It's absolutely delicious and would be great on chicken and pork too. I baked the fish at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Super yummy! Thanks for a great recipe, Decodiana.","I am disappointed that I had to use salmon for this as the market did not have mahi mahi. I really enjoyed it anyway. I marinated the fish for 2 hours and used probably just under 2T of ginger. It was excellent. I added some cornstarch dissolved in cool water to thicken it. I baked it on a bake sheet at 450 for 15 minutes. i took it out, brushed with glazed and returned to the broiler for 3 minutes until the glaze carmelized on it. I let the fish rest for 3-5 minutes before serving and served it with sauteed cabbage and bok choy on the side. Wonderful.","Easy and delicious. This is full of flavor. I will definitely make it again. I added the remaining marinade to the pan after turning the fish. That was just enough time to reduce the marinade AND glaze the fish, all in one step. Hubby loved this.","This was DELICIOUS! I made it once with fresh ginger as directed and it was AMAZING. The second time I made the mistake of switching to ground ginger and it was yucky yucky. lol Stick to the recipe, it's PERFECT!","I will say right up front that I used this on boneless chicken breasts pounded to half an inch thick and grilled on a stove top grill for 2 minutes per side instead of mahi mahi and it was wonderful! I'm positive it would taste just as wonderful on mahi mahi, or halibut, or any ""white"" fish. For my taste it would even work on turkey! The marinade itself produces a beautiful shiny glaze of a rich mahogany color. The sweetness of the honey and balsamic vinegar is balanced with the saltiness of the the soy sauce and pungency of the garlic to produce a tangy sauce that's sweet but not not cloying. I liked the sauce so much that, rather than reducing it in a skillet, I took the reserved marinade and brought it just to a boil in a saucepan. Then I mixed a heaping teaspoon of cornstarch and a third cup of water and added that, boiling gently just until the sauce thickened. This yielded almost one full cup of sauce. I set it on the table for my family to add as they liked. I will definitely make this again.",My husband loved this! Watch out for the glaze - you need to use it immediatly. It does not reheat well.,,,,,,,,,
87,"I debated trying these for a long time before I finally did it. I was almost positive they were going to be too weird for us! I give this a 4 instead of a 5 because I made half with black beans and half with kidney beans and the black beans were much better! Also, mashing the beans after they're in the skillet is a real pain. Next time I'll mash them first. I was worried that it was going to be too much cumin and chili powder, but used all the spices just as the recipe suggested and it was the perfect contrast against the subtle sweetness of the potatoes. Next time I'll use a little more cheese in each burrito. Served with sour cream.","I recently became a vegetarian and I was looking for a good pre-race meal that would provide my body with the energy needed during a triathlon. This recipe fits the bill! As the recipe makes 8-10 depending on what size tortilla you use, I have shared these with several of my cycling and triathlete friends and EVERYONE of them has asked for the recipe. I only made a few changes to this recipe. I used 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 cup frozen corn as my bean mixture. Mash the beans with a potato masher prior to adding the corn for better texture. I also substituted 8in multigrain low carb tortillas for the flour tortillas, as well as 2% sharp cheddar cheese instead of mild cheddar. Last, but not least, I put a tablespoon of light sour cream on my burrito after it is heated and ready to eat. These burritos keep very well. After cooking them in the oven, I let them cool then wrap each one in a paper towel and freeze in a zip lock bag. To reheat, just remove from bag, leave in paper towel, and heat in microwave for 2 minutes. These are just fabulious!!!","Very good and very healthy. Flavours were just right. Like other reviewers, I used black beans in place of kidney beans and left them quite chunky when I mashed them. I baked the sweet potatoes and scooped them out and mashed them very smooth with salt and pepper. I used reduced fat old cheddar and whole wheat tortillas. Served with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes, green onions and green peppers and light sour cream. We both loved them. They are quite large, I couldn't finish mine; next time I may make them in the 6-inch tortillas. I froze ten of them, and both my boyfriend and I are looking forward to taking them for lunches! Many thanks for the recipe! *UPDATE* Just a quick note on reheating the frozen burritos...It works perfectly in the oven from frozen. 30 mins wrapped in foil at 350, them 15 mins unwrapped to crisp them up. Better than when I first made them!","This was surprisingly good!! I made it into a baked casserole, layering corn tortillas, bean mixture, yams, cheese. I used black beans and jalapeno jack cheese, added green bell peppers, increased the spices, and garnished w/ sour cream and green onions. My family LOVED it. Do reduce the liquid by half.","5 Star Concept - 3 Star Execution. There is no place for water in this recipe and including it wrecked it for the unwitting as reported in their reviews. The correct way to make this recipe is to cook kidney beans from dry goods. 1 lb. makes 6 cups. They will be perfect and ready without mashing or water. 3 large yams skinned, cooked (13 minutes in microwave in Pyrex pot with water) should make 6 cups – mash in a big stock pot on low heat. Make seasoning as a sauce by using exact ingredients plus 2 squirts of Sriracha and 2 tbls of sweet chili sauce and one tbls safflower oil. The end result will be mildly spicy by American standards. To make spicier, add more chili powder, cayenne, and Sriracha sauce in suggested proportions. Pour the sauce evenly on top of the beans in the skillet and stir. 4 tbls high heat safflower is best oil for this recipe. Also, 12 oz of cheese is required. Type of Cheddar is not called out. Sharp is best for this recipe – Mexican blend will work. This recipe will produce exactly the stated dozen 10” burritos. Thus, it will produce (10) 12” burritos (12” flour tortillas are the best value at Costco). If you prepare dish to these specs you will have a fab meal and leftovers while realizing the full potential of the concept, which is excellent.","I make this recipe all the time - it's become a staple in my household. Wonderful! I would recommend using a potato masher to mash the beans, as this is the most time-consuming part. I also scale the recipe down to make 5 burritos (1 can beans, 1 can sweet potatos, 1/4 onion).","Thank you Karena for sharing this recipe. I made it as per the recipe, except, I cut the ingredients in half, as this makes a large amount. The spice level for me was just right, as I like to taste the other ingredients in the recipe and not overpower them with heavy spices. As my tastes are not the same as yours, I will probably make a few changes, the next time I make this and there will be a next time. Possibly a different type of bean and try a different cheese, like pepper jack for a kick. I don't normally write reviews for the recipes on here, but I finally felt like voicing my opinion. I feel that some of the reviews, on this site, not just on this recipe, would be better left off. Especially the ones that totally re-write a recipe. My advise to all members, is to keep in mind a quote that I read from Chef Michael Smith. He wrote "" Recipes are how one cook shares ideas with another cook! They're just words on paper; a guideline, a starting point from which to improvise"" These words are absolutely true. Every recipe on this site, will have alterations done to it, to suit each persons own tastes. A few tweaks mentioned are good, but if your are going to re-write it...submit your own. Thanks again Karena, and to all the other cooks that have the guts to submit their recipes for us to enjoy.","Awesome, but I would used refried beans next time so avoid the hassle of mashing the kidney beans.","Oh my goodness, these are incredible. I was sceptical at first - but the flavor of these was awesome. I actually only started out with about a fourth of a batch, which made four burritos, and used a can of black beans instead of the called for kidney beans. Also used tomato-basil tortillas and used a Mexican cheddar-jack mix instead of straight cheddar. I'm making a bigger batch next time, because these were just TOO GOOD!",This is real similar to a recipe that I have from a Moosewood low-fat cookbook. I have made these frequently...even my meat-eater hubby likes these. I use black beans and top with salsa and low-fat sour cream. A winner!,"The beans in this recipe were tasteful but if you like your beans spicy I would recommend adding more cayenne pepper. These were not as good as I thought they would be but they were goo. Next time to cut the time shorter I would steam the potatoes or microwave them first rather then boil water and then wait till they are soft. No one liked them but me, they are probably a bad idea for picky eaters.","I am always a bit skeptical when trying ""vegetarian"" recipes. I was raised a vegetarian and I love good vegetarian food, not just “vegetarian” food. There is a difference! These are delicious! If I had a restaurant these burritos would defiantly be on the menu under the ""Really Good Vegetarian Food"" section! Even my husband who does not enjoy vegetarian food really likes them.**UPDATE** OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!!!! 5 ***** AFTER MY MODIFICATIONS!!!! I FOUND A NEW WAY TO ENJOY THESE!!! I SAUTEED 2 CUPS FINELY CHOPPED ONION UNTIL TRANSLUCENT IN A LITTLE OIL. THEN I ADDED BLACK BEANS 39 OZ OF THEM (I HAD A 15 OZ AND A 24 OZ CAN) . I MASHED THE BEANS TO RESEMBLE GROUND BEEF, ABOUT 50/50. THEN I ADDED A PKG OF TACO SEASONING B/C I WAS PRESSED FOR TIME AND A LITTLE WATER ABOUT 3/4 CUP (EYEBALL IT). I BAKED 4 LARGE SWEET POTATOES MASHED THEM AND ADDED CINNAMON (YOU WONT BELIEVE HOW GOOD IT IS TILL YOU TRY IT) (A LOT OF MEXICAN DISHES ADD CINNAMON)I PUT EQUAL PARTS BEAN MIXTURE AND POTATO MIXTURE INTO SOFT TORTILLAS (THEY WERE SOFT ENOUGH OUT OF THE PACKAGE SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO WARM THEM TO GET 'EM TO BEND . . . BE CHOOSY WHEN BUYING THEM!) I WRAPPED THEM LIKE A PRESENT AND FRIED 3 OF THEM IN A PAN W/ A BIT OF OIL AND FROZE THE REST ON A COOKIE SHEET TILL FIRM AND PLACED THEM IN A BAG IN THE FREEZER. THIS RECIPE MAKES ABOUT 18. AFTER FRYING THEM I TOPPED THEM W/ CHEESE SALSA AND SOUR CREAM YUM YUM!!!! 5 STARS WITH MY ALTERATIONS *****","agreed - use combo of beans - red, pinto and kidney. Top with plain yogurt to be healthy. Lots of ""to taste"" liberties with this recipe. Really delish!","I was very skeptical before I made this recipe. I simply couldn't imagine that the list of ingredients would work well together. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. This recipe is very good. One thing I would do differently is use small tortillas. These burritos are very filling, and I could barely get through one large burrito. If you have leftovers, no problem, they freeze beautifully!","I find it irritating that people practically change the entire recipe and then give it a rating. I tried the recipe as written and it is very good. My entire family loved it. Come on people, if you are going to re-write the recipe, add it as a new recipe and don't grade it after you have changed it.","Finally... FINALLY! I made these today! Only been about a year since I saved the dang recipe! LOL! I cut the recipe in half after I looked at the recipe ingredients and thought wow - it's only me eating them! not the Canadian Armed Forces along with me! (but boys - you know I would feed you if I could!) ANYWAY, these are all they are hyped up to be and then some! I did use Black Beans in place of kidney as I was out of kidney and noticed others had either half and half'd them with kidney or used black beans alone...I prefer the black beans personally over kidney anyday. I did cut WAY back on the water though, probably a mere 1/4 cup as it just seemed like WAY too much liquid for all that was going on in the pan and I skipped the soy sauce altogether as I do not use it (too salty)....I also used 6-inch tortillas and after halfing the recipe, got 7 small burritos out of the deal, served with fat-free sour cream, this actually makes a pretty good 'waist' friendly meal with going really, really light on the cheese and using w/w, low-carb tortillas like I did...kudos to Karena, you definitely have a winner here!",These were fabulous! I made these when my boyfriend's vegan cousin came for dinner (she used vegan cheese) and they were a big hit! I also mashed the beans before adding them to the skillet but kept everything else the same.,I used Black Beans instead of kidney beans - also had to scramble when I discovered that I didn't have soy sauce or chili powder - used sukiyaki sauce and cajun seasoning instead - I liked them a lot more than my kids did - good change of pace - thanks,"Wow! I thought the combination of sweet potatoes, kidney beans, mustard, and soy sauce sounded very strange - but I was pleasantly surprised. The result was absolutely wonderful. I love sweet potatoes, and I am always looking for new sweet potato recipes - I love Mexican-inspired food, as well. What a great dish. I used corn tortillas instead of flour - I guess that's a matter of personal preference. Thanks, Karena!","Very good! I took the advice of others and made the following changes: black beans instead of kidney, only mashed 1/2 of them, I only needed about 1/4 to 1/2 cup water rather than the 2 cups called for, added about a cup of corn, added about 3 oz cream cheese to the sweet potato mash, and added cilantro with the cheese. My husband put sour cream on his at the table. I warmed my wraps in the microwave & just served that way, no oven needed. I did make some in the oven but I felt the flavor was much better just right off the stove. My husband loved it and this will go into our regular cooking rotation and I'll be serving it to guests soon! This is by far the best sweet potato burrito recipe I've ever tried. YUM!","we doctored this to make it really easy. We used canned re-fried beans, spiced up with salsa, and just put them in the microwave. The whole thing took 10 minutes from the moment we walked into the kitchen. And yes, they are unusual and delicious!!!!","I made this recipe into enchiladas by using the red enchilada sauce recipe on this site. I also added green and red peppers and used refriend beans. I seasoned the sweet potatos (after I boiled them) with cayenne pepper, paprika and a bit of honey . They needed about 16 mintues in the oven but they turned out wonderful. Topped with cilantro this made a very healthy and very hearty meal. I definately recommend it with the sauce. It gives it a very nice taste and texture. I'm considering adding my own recipe to this site after I refine it a bit!","My husband & I love this recipe and I don't even like sweet potatoes! Over the year we have made a few changes: Use 1 can kidney beans, 1 can of corn (drained), 1 cup of water, 2 cooked potatoes, and 6 tortillas. After heating the onions/beans and adding the potatoes, we then add the water, bit by bit until the mixture is smooth. Sometimes it does not take the whole cup of water. We also put the cheese inside the burrito and put sour cream on top when it's done.","-Wonderful texture; I used black beans and a can of mixed beans. -My wife, who would neither choose a beans nor a yam recipe, thought this dish was wonderful. -We froze them and 'grab and go' for work. -Mad MUCH more than 10 burritos. Buy extra tortillas.","I have been eyeballin' this recipe for quite some time. It seemed intriguing... but mustard and soy sauce?... Really? I finally gave it a try this week. After all, 1000+ reviewers can't be wrong... right? I.FELL.IN.LOVE. Naturally, I changed things up a bit. I sliced my sweet potatoes into 1/4 inch thick slices, tossed them in some oil, cumin, and kosher salt, placed them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet, and baked them at a 450 degrees, flipping them once, until they were nice and speckled brown. I didn't mash the sweet potatoes at all but put them in the burrito with the other ingredients as is. Didn't change much else to the recipe, except ""cooking"" the cumin, cayenne, and chili powder, which is pretty much a necessity. I also added some fresh jalapeno, cilantro, and green onion as well. I've made it twice this week for friends and roommates. EVERYONE is enamored with these most excellent burritos!","Great recipe! I served it with Newman's Own pineapple salsa and it was fantastic! I scaled the recipe down to three servings and it fed two adults and a child w/ left overs! I did mix black beans w/ the kidney (equal parts) and I left the potatoes and the beans a little chunky instead of mashing the whole thing. Next time the only changes I will make is to not mash any of it (the texture adds to it) and leaving out the cheese (I ended up scraping mine off, I didn't think it needed it).",,,,,,,,,,
88,"I've made this recipe as is with the fried fish and it is great, but I have also grilled the fish and it has come out even more tasty. I marinate the fish in lime and a bit of jalapenos to add flavor, and just dust with chili powder and salt before grilling. They come out moist and tasty, and best of all healthier! I also suggest using cabbage slaw mixture instead of just straight cabbage. It adds color and flavor as well. The sauce is amazing as is though. None of the flavors are too overpowering, and it's so tangy on the fish, a perfect combination!","Muy bueno! * To make it lighter/healthier, double up the lime and jalapeno juice. After you've prepped the chipotle with some of the juice, add some olive oil, and use the rest to marinade the fish. I George Forman'ed the fish, but fry pan or baking/broiling would work too. If you have fast fingers, and you want to make it easier, cut the fillets after frying. * If your palate is sensitive to spicy, drop the jalapeno. If jalapeno is too sour for you, replace with smaller(!) amount of habanero. * If you have a vegetable/fruit juicer, it cuts down on the prep time of the lime and jalapeno/habanero. * Side this with avacado or guac. * Side this with (easy) beans and rice. Remove 1/3 cup of water before boiling. When adding brown rice, throw in a can of black beans. Do this before cooking the fish, since brown rice takes about 25-30 minutes to soak up the water. Some people subtract more water and also throw in a can of stewed tomatoes. I like to add garlic powder. * Heat up the corn tortillas before serving. If you don't have a tortilla warmer, then make sure you fold in half before they cool. * Capers are just a garnish, don't worry if you can't find any. * If you are opposed to beer, use ginger ale. * If you don't have cod, any white fish will do. Some people have had success with salmon. * If cutting cabbage is a pain for you, use a package of mix and serve cole slaw, tossing the cole slaw packet. * Add cilantro and/or pink onion as a garnish or into the cabbage.","5 stars is not high enough for this recipe. I give it 100 stars!! Yum, Yum Yummy! I cannot believe how delicious the beer batter was. It's such a simple recipe, but it's so light and crispy and scrumptious. The white sauce was very, very good...hmm, I'm sorry, I meant to say excellent! I used sourcream instead of yogart. I was leery of the capers..because I don't like them, so I minced the heck out of them so they would just kinda get lost in the sauce and provide flavor. I used 1/2 of the cayenne pepper, because that would be just too hot for my kids, and it had plenty of kick, and my kids still complained. I made a double batch of the white sauce, and I am so glad I did, because we lapped up just about ever bit I made. I also made up some fresh Pico De Gallo..it's simple to make and you can find that recipe everywhere on line. It added such a freshness to this meal. It was nice to make something for dinner tonight that I didn't open a jar or some pre made thing. I prepared everthing from scratch except for the corn tortillas. I used the corn tortillas and soft fried them..they were perfect. OH MY GOD, I can't wait to make these again. Be sure to make the sauce ahead of time so it will have time for all those ingredients to blend. I gave it 8 hours, but at least 2 would be sufficient.Try this recipe, it is worth the time and effort, and the batter would be terrific in many other types of things to fry.","This was a great fast and easy recipe to make for dinner. I substituted light sour cream for the yogurt and used light mayo. As some reviewers suggested, I used fresh, minced cilantro instead of oregano and fresh minced dill. Instead of frying, I coated the cod w/ olive oil, lime, s&p and grilled it. Right before I took the fish off the grill, I put the corn tortillas directly on the grill and only slightly toasted them on each side. This definitely cuts any frying to make this a more diet friendly recipe. Great for casual outdoor dining.","Awesome. I made this mostly for the sauce, I did not fry the fish- just cooked in a pan with a splash of olive oil. Sauce was great, used low fat yogurt and mayo, cut the seeds and membrane out of half the pepper, but not the other. It was spicy, but that's ok, because all the flavors came through. I only used maybe a teaspoon of sauce on each taco and it was very good. Also made some guac and put on the tacos. Good stuff.","What made these tacos amazing was the white sauce. I was sceptical upon reading the ingredients, but it was awesome. The contrast in textures also made this a perfect meal. the crunchy battered fish with the soft tortillas and the cooling sauce...a masterpiece on the tongue. Do not forget to serve this with a cold beer. Also, my only criticism of this recipe was that the batter lacked ""punch"". We added a few dashes of salt to the fish immediately after being taken out of the fryer, it made a huge difference. We also served the tacos w/ a homemade salsa which was good, but probably not essential. Overall, this is a rockin' taco...I'll definitley make these again.","I love this recipe !! If I don't have time to batter the fish I buy the frozen battered fish, bake it, and cut it up onto the corn tortillas. Quick and easy if your in a rush.","Tell your friends, tell your neighbors . . . have them over for dinner, this stuff is YUMMO!!! I think this may very well be my favorite recipe that I have gotten from this site. I did salt the fish after frying. My modifications to the sauce: I used nonfat yogurt, light mayo, pickled jalepeno, subbed mexican oregano, added some ancho powder . . . we couldn't get enough! The sauce is an important component - the ingredients may sound a bit odd to some but it works to a T. Can't wait to have it again!","Good recipe, trick with batter is do not whisk too hard. You must not break up the bubbles from the beer, otherwise the will become too bready and not puff up. Also, sauce needs a little salt.","Wow! The sauce for these was AWESOME!!! I cheated a little and used pre-breaded frozen fish. I also traded some of the cayenne pepper for Old Bay seasoning, and I used a lemon instead of a lime. Oh, and I used sour cream instead of plain yogurt. But I loved these! They were soooooo good! I wanted to try them with the actual fish recipe next! Yum, yum, yum!","The best!!! I do not fry the fish I first dredge the fish in an egg and milk mixture then in panko crumbs and baked at 350 degrees. The sauce, what can I say AWESOME!!!!!! I do not use a jalapeno and a sprinkle of red pepper. I also add a few extra capers not minced. thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!!",I made the fish my own way - breaded with flour and cornmeal and broiled four minutes each side (used Tilapia). I made a double recipe of the sauce (nixed the cumin but only because I didn't have any) and mixed about half of it with a bag of shredded coleslaw blend (no regular coleslaw sauce of course). I put the rest of the sauce in a bowl incase anyone wanted more. I was a little skeptical about the sauce because I didn't really like it straight from the bowl as I was making it (did use sour cream not yogurt). But once I put it on the taco with the fish and the cabbage blend - wow! It was really good! Gave the tacos a great fresh taste. We also added slices of avocado. I forgot to put it out but next time we plan to sprinkle some cilantro on top of it also. Yum! Thanks for a great sauce! UPDATE - I added some fresh cilantro to the next tacos and some very thinly sliced onions as well - wow. Even better flavor...,"mmm. these taco's are so good! i added chopped onion, cilantro, & tomatoes. my kids really enjoyed building their own taco's.","5+ stars. We Loved this. Use tilipia thats all I had; did not have yogurt so used sour cream; used dried cilrentro instead of oregano; and milk instead of beer. DELICIOUS, YUMMY, Wonderful, Great, - all describes how this was. Added tomatoes; avacados; onions on top. Will for sure make again.","I lived in San Diego too and Fish Tacos are one of my favorite. I took my boyfriend on vacation there and got him hooked to. THis is the BEST FISH TACO RECIPE that I can find! Taste just like the ones I used to get from the little taco stand. YOu will love these, if you do not have time to batter the fish you can use frozen pre-battered fish. I like Gordans x-tra crispy. You must use a white fish to get the right taste, the sauce is what makes the taco and this one is the BEST ON THE WEB!!!!!!","Just ok. I made it mainly for the sauce. A Bit disappointed. Although the Ideal of fish, a cream sauce and cabbage is good together. I think just plain tarter sauce would be good, with all the fixings.","We love fish tacos but they are REALLY REALLY good when put in a crispy corn taco shell! An alternative to frying fish is to chop it into chunks and sprinkle with salt, cumin, and a bit of butter, toss and bake it on a cookie sheet at 400 until done. About 10 minutes or so.","This was fantastic! By far one of my favorite recipes from this site, and one of the only ones I've never ""tweaked"". Per another member's suggestion, the first time I made it I used Mahi Mahi, which was wonderful. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. The fresh lime really made all the difference. And although somewhat time consuming, it wasn't so difficult that I won't make it again and again. The beer batter recipe was a great one and even if you don't want to make tacos, it's great for just making fish and chips, too. I made this again, trying to be healthy and just used grilled fish, nonfat yogurt and light mayo, and instead of cabbage I used ""broccoli slaw"" which looks like coleslaw and comes already cut up and pre-packaged. Even this way, it was GREAT! I don't think you can go wrong with this sauce no matter how you make your tacos.","My husband visited San Diego several years ago and he's been talking about fish tacos ever since! This recipe was the closest thing we've found to what he remembers. A note, though: After a few batches, he substituted half of the mayo with Miracle whip salad dressing and the other half with cole slaw dressing. The sauce was delicious. Thanks for what has become my favorite meal!","Really, really GOOD!!! I marinated my fish in the juice of one lime, chopped cilantro, and olive oil and then just cooked it on top of the stove. I just warmed my tortillas in a dry skillet. I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it was plenty spicy for us. The sauce is very good though! Will definitely be making again.","This was very good, especially the white sauce! I think next time I will try to grill the fish to make it healthier, but the sauce was perfection! I loved it with the cabbage as well. I just used small flour tortillas and had soft tacos instead!","Thankyou for taking me home to San Diego! I've missed Rubio's Fish Tacos so much. Being a mom with not much time on my hands, I skipped the battering part and instead soaked pre-battered fish fillets in beer and then crisped them in the oven. In my opinion, it turned out just like Rubio's. The sauce was WAY too spicy for me. To mend the sauce to my taste buds, I tripled everything except the cayenne and jalapenos. I decided to freeze the extra into single serving freezer containers to save me time in the future. I'll give you 5 stars because you've met my craving. This was the closest to Rubios I've found since moving away from SD 5 years ago. Thanks for sharing.","Great recipe! I lived in San Diego for a year and used to frequent Rubio's, ""home of the fish taco"". We loved the taco's and this is about as close as you can get to the real thing. The only thing that I omitted was the capers in the white sauce, they probably would've been fine, I am just not a big fan of them. Thanks Tanya for a taste of my past!!","EASY recipe for a quick dinner. I also used frozen breaded fish and my family gobbled these up, even my picky 14 year old. I recommend doubling the sauce because there wasn't enough!",Wow! I so enjoyed this recipe. It reminded me of the yummy fish tacos I used to get in San Diego.,"This was absolutely fantastic! I added some season salt to leftover batter and made onion rings to go with the tacos... yummy! I used tomato and lettuce instead of cabbage, and it was yummy too :) Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!!","Excellent - the other reviews were right! It's the sauce that makes this so awesome. No matter how you cook your fish, just make sure to make this sauce. I had some leftover and used it as a dip for tortilla chips.","I only made the sauce for the tacos, but there was way to much cayenne pepper. Too spicy and I love spicy! My son could barely choke it down. Very disappointed! I was so excited to make this because of the excellent reviews. Wont make again.",We live in San Diego and eat a lot of fish tacos at Rubios or down in Baja. We tried this recipe with freshy caught fish and were extremely happy with the results. My husband wants to make this for the guys at his fire station so it is THAT GOOD! The batter and sauce are key and make the recipe.,"This recipe was flawless. The absolute best recipe I've tried on this site and I've been on here for years! I used Bud Lime for the beer batter. I also added lemon pepper to flour to dust the tilapia in before dipping in the beer batter. For the sauce, I did not have capers so I minced 1 tbsp of green olives. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. I used 1 tbsp dill pickle juice instead of dill weed. I also cut the cayenne to half of a teaspoon. It still had a lovely kick, but was not overpowering. I mixed the sauce with a prepackaged undressed coleslaw of cabbage and carrots. I put fish and coleslaw on corn tortillas garnished with a little cilantro. I served the fish tacos with homemade mango salsa and tortilla chips and black beans. My family went nuts over it. Will definitely be making this many, many times. Thanks for a great recipe! It was just like eating a phenomenal fish taco at the beach!","Mexican sour cream (added to the mayo & lime) is a lot better tasting and more authentic than yogurt. Also, be warned that buying substitutions for this recipe yield badly tasting results. Use quality beer (preferably Mexican) and lime. No lemon, as it will cause the sauce to taste quite different. To save oil, I used a smaller sauce pot for the deep fry and to cut calories, I steamed the tortillas in the microwave rather than fried. Make a homemade salsa of cilantro, red onions, Lowry's garlic pepper, and fresh tomatoes for added flavor and health. =)",,,,,

91,"Ok here's the scoop on any revision you might want to make! I've been making this lasagna for over a year and it is excellent... **You do need more sauce! Just add an extra 14 oz can of crushed or diced tomatoes and increase garlic, onions and other spices by a small amount as well. **2 Tbs of brown sugar is just right. **1&1/2 pound of hamburger is an awful lot, I've decreased it to 1/2 pound and that was plenty for this non-meat loving family! **I use 9x13 cake pan, and 12 lasagna noodles would fill it to overflowing! I've found 9 noodles (3 layers of 3 noodles each) to be enough. **30 minutes is no where near long enough to cook this thing! 20 minutes uncovered just to get it started, then 1 hour loosely covered with foil, then remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes is more like it! This recipe is very forgiving, and judging by all the comments, very flexible as well. Hope my comments help someone one else...","WARNING... I made the receipe a day ahead as suggested. Although I thought it was odd, I saw the cook time was 30 min and followed directions without looking back at the cook and prep times listed at the top of the web page (when I hit PRINT, those didn't print out, just the actual receipe!). I should have known better. There must be a typeo at the bottom of the receipe, it does NOT cook in 30 min, but an hour and 30 like it says at the top! It was easy to figure out my mistake, and I should have prob known better, but in a rush I followed the receipe and planned for 30 min. Now we'll have to wait another 60 to eat. Oops. I hope it's as wonderful as everyone says, it smells fabulous! And DO add some extra tomato sauce and water to the sauce.","I have found my staple lasagna recipe! I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, but I only used a pound, next time I will double it because I like lots of meat. I took the advice of another reviewer, and used 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on the top layer to keep the noodles from drying out, it worked beautifully. I used two 15 oz. containers of ricotta, and doubled the sauce as suggested by others. I doubled the garlic and added fresh ground pepper to the sauce, used a mixture of shredded mozzarella and shredded parmesan, and I only needed to use 9 lasagna noodles. I put it together the night before, baked it covered for 1 hour and uncovered for 20 minutes. If you do cover it during baking, make sure to use nonstick cooking spray on the foil, or the cheese will stick. It sliced perfectly, too. My husband said it was just as good as the lasagna his Italian stepfather makes, and he's been cooking for more than 50 years with recipes older than that! That was the best compliment I could have ever gotten! The next time we have people over, this is the dish I'm going to make. I served it with cheesy garlic bread, I only wish I'd had caesar salad to go along with it. I will make this again and again. Thank you, Rosemary! PS: A disposable pan will be your best friend in this recipe.","I believe this is a great basic recipe. I made several modifications to fit my tastes (adding mushooms, increasing spices, using turkey instead of beef), but that versitility only increases the value of the recipe in my mind. Others have commented on the dryness and that concerned me a bit. I didn't find it dry at all and have a couple of observations that I didn't see in other reviews. First, the recipe isn't clear whether the tomatoes should be drained or not. Do NOT drain them, use the juice in the sauce. Second, use cooked noodles. Uncooked dry or fresh noodles (I used fresh) will absorb water from the sauce and make the finished product drier. I suspect the same is true of the oven ready product I have never used. Third, I did end up adding a half-cup of water to be sure, but this will depend on how you simmer and personal tastes. I think adding about this much red wine as some others suggest could add flavor and the needed moisture. I gave it only four stars because of the discrepancy on cooking times (it needs 1 1/2 hours, not 30 min) and not being clear on retaining the juice in the diced tomatoes. Otherwise, I think it's a great and very adaptable recipe. Thanks, Rosemary.",This is now going to be the lasagna recipe I use from now on. The only change I made was I used a mixture of half ricotta cheese and half cottage cheese instead of all ricotta. I refrigerated it overnight before baking it as the recipe author suggests and added 15 minutes to the baking time indicated in the recipe however I found that the edges were starting to burn before the center was done. If you're refrigerating the lasagna overnight before baking it I suggest covering it with aluminum foil for the first 20 minutes of baking and baking it at 350 rather than 375. That way the center can heat up without the edges burning first.,"Wow!! Wonderful flavor! Be sure and simmer the sauce the maximum amount of time. Making the lasagna a day ahead and refrigerating is definitely key to having outstanding flavor! I made this a second time, and used Italian-seasoned turkey sausage, ground in my food processor. What a difference it made - will definitely do that again!! Also note that 1 tsp. dried basil works if you don't have fresh basil on hand, and lowfat ricotta is just fine as well. I bake mine covered with aluminum foil for 20 minutes (then 10 minutes without) to prevent it from drying out. I have made this lasagna several times, and like others, I thought it could use more sauce. I now add an extra 14.5 oz. can of Italian-style diced tomatoes, and increase the spices a bit. PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe!!","This is a great recipe, but better with some modifications. I followed several suggestions from other reviews. Mainly, this lasagna would be way too dry and bland without more sauce and spices. I added the equivalent of 1 1/2 28 oz cans of pre-seasoned sauce. To the sauce I also added lots of xtra garlic and fresh oregano plus I used half ground beef and half hot italian sausage instead of all beef (next time I might even go with all sausage because that added a lot of good flavor). I was going to add some crushed red pepper flakes but forgot, so I will add a little next time. To the filling I added a few xtra ounces of ricotta, a few xtra ounces of mozzarella (I used part skim), and 4 ounces of cream cheese. I also used xtra parmesan on the top. I cut the brown sugar in half and also used a little less salt. I don't know if I needed to, but I sprayed the pan with Pam and also spread a little sauce on top of that and clean up was a snap. I had modified the recipe for 12 servings and used a bigger pan and I cooked it for about 1 hr 40 minutes. Clearly the 30 minute cook time at the bottom of the recipe is a misprint and should read the 1 1/2 hrs that it states at the top. Also, I covered with foil for half of the cooking time which helped keep it moist on top. I served this to 10 girlfriends and they all thought it was terrific!","My family of 6, consisting of 5 finicky men all loved this lasagna, just when they thought I couldn't improve on my own I try this and they were flabergasted! Only two things I changed. One was I subed italian sausage for 1/2 the hamburger and second WAY TOO MUCH SALT! I cut the salt out completely and nobody noticed! There is plenty of salt in the cheeses and the diced tomatoes to suit our tastes. Stopped by to correct my spelling...and to tell you all we still love this and I make only this recipe now.","Yummy!! Like other posts, I realized I was going to need more sauce halfway through the recipe. Luckily I had another can of diced tomatoes in the pantry. So I added more to my sauce. Plus, I cooked mine 20 minutes uncovered and an hour covered and it turned out perfectly.:-) The best lasgna I've ever had! Who needs the Olive Garden?:-) Notice the cook time at the top of the recipe...1.5 hours. THIS is the correct time, not the specifed 30 minutes! Allrecipes really should change this.","DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE! How can anyone give this more than one star, let alone 5! Such a dry recipe, tasted burned because they had you simmer tomato paste which is already dry! Not even water helped this recipe. If you want a kick butt lasagna, search for WHITE CHEESE CHICKEN LASAGNA.... Wow, what a good meal that was, everyone raved over it! It's not your red, dried out lasagna, it's a moist, cheesy white chicken lasagna. Please mark this review as helpful, so others may see it too!",Very good. I cut the recipe in half and used no-boil noodles. Lasagna sliced nicely and had good flavor but this is just your standard lasagna recipe. I will make this again though since it's good AND easy.,"Positively incredible! Edit: I think I've perfected it. I use 2lbs ground beef with 4 cloves of garlic. Then I add an additional 15oz can of sauce to the tomato sauce. (Add more of the other spices, but keep the brown sugar at 2Tbsp.) I use 1.5lb mozz and .5lb of italian cheese mix for the cheese part. I also put a light layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan to help noodles from drying out. Then I put enough sauce to cover the top layer of noodles and then top with sliced mozzarella from a block (not the shredded type.) This keeps the moisture in. 1 hour covered and then 20 min uncovered (kept in fridge overnight) and I had a bubbly, moist, delicious lasagna. If you are skeptical, you MUST TRY! Edit 2 - I ""stole"" some ideas from ""World's Best Lasagna"".. use 1 lb. beef, 1 lb. sweet italian sausage, add a little nutmeg to the ricotta. Ahhhhhh.","This was sooo good that I wanted to have some for breakfast this morning(but I did maintain self control). I added a half pound italian sausage to the ground beef and an extra can of italian style diced tomatoes with a splash of red wine. I also made 3 layers using 3 noodles per layer. And we love cheese so there was lots of it. I refrigerated it for 2 days before cooking. OH SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! Tip: instead of cooking the noodles, soak them in hot faucet water for a while and then layer. They absorb the water and then cook in the oven. Also, put a little sauce on the bottom of the pan, it helps with moisture.","I have been using this recipe since 2005. The changes I have made are to add 1 can of tom sauce, use half ground beef/half Italian sausage, parsley in place of the basil, crushed instead of diced toms, only 1 Tb Brown sugar, and omit the last teaspoon of salt. Sometimes I let it set overnight in frig; sometimes not. Either way this is a great recipe that everyone always raves about. I have even made the sauce by itself to serve with pasta. Love it.","***This review is for my VEGETARIAN version*** I made this vegetarian by subbing one 8oz package of Smart Ground protein crumbles for the 1.5 pounds of ground beef. It turned out to be just the right amount of ""meat"" in my opinion. I used 1.5 onions rather than 1 and doubled the basil, oregano, and garlic. I also added one teaspoon of cayenne pepper which added just the perfect amount of spice. I did NOT think this needed more sauce. This could be because I simmered my sauce at a low temperature and added about a half a cup of water half way through. As others have stated, 9 lasagna noodles was perfect. I covered with foil and baked for an hour, then removed foil and baked for another 20 min. Summary: As lasagnas go, this turned out to be very good! I will make this again.",Very good and easy to make. I added a 2/3 box of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) to the ricotta cheese mixture.,"DELISH!!! I just made this and will be coming back to it again for sure! My husband loves lasagna however I have never made it. He said it was the best lasagna he has ever had and couldn't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow. I only made a few changes. I added a 15oz. can of tomato sauce to stretch the meat sauce a bit more. My husband said that he always wishes that the lasagna he has had in the past had more ricotta cheese so I doubled the ricotta, parmesan, parsley and eggs. It was AWESOME! next time I think I am going to cut the recipe in half except for the ricotta portion and do that as the recipe calls. It made enough lasagna to last us weeks!","The first time I made this recipe I was pretty disappointed. I think I listened too carefully to the reviews and didn't give the recipe a chance. I made it again somewhat reluctantly, having forgotten all the discussion of what it needed, what it lacked, etc. and just followed the recipe - the only exception was that I added an additional 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and four tablespoons of the left-over pasta water to the sauce (I learned the pasta water is an Italian trick). It turned out so much better than the first time! I learned my lesson -- this is fantastic if you just trust the recipe!","This Lasagna recipe is great. I made two pans of it for a party and everyone loved it. The first time I made it I did what others had suggested about substituting some of the ground beef with sausage, and adding another can of tomatoes. I also did that the second time I made it but I only put in half of the sugar. So many people loved the lasagna it was amazing. This one is definately a keeper.","I did not make this the night before. I didn't have time for that. I did make the sauce this afternoon and let it simmer for a few hours and I added a few small personal touches. I have to make my meat stretch the next couple weeks, so I only used about a half pound or so of ground beef and made up the rest in chopped vegetables; shredded zucchini, chopped peppers, mushrooms, onion and a mess of fresh minced garlic. Right after everything was combined, I added in a slosh of red wine. I doubled the oregano, only used only a pinch of salt AND I used organic diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Because I'm on a budget and we're watching our salt intake, (and we don't really care for ricotta), I used ""Trim"" cottage cheese and I did not add extra salt to the cheese mix. This really was quick to assemble, made a HUGE panful and was quite enjoyed by us and our dinner guests. I think I avoided the ""dry lasagna"" issue because I did not let mine set overnight but I think the sauce was better after I simmered it for a bit. With homemade whole wheat rolls, this was a filling, economical and enjoyable meal.",Absolutely the best lasagna! I have not come across anyone that I served this to that didn't love it. The only change I made was adding more garlic. I also used a larger pan because this didn't fit into my 9X13.,Great recipe although I made several changes to cut the calories from 642/8 or 428/12 down to 325 per 1/12 slice. Cut back the meat to 1 lb and drained fat after saute. Used reduced fat mozzarella and ricotta and used 9 lasagna strips of Dreamfield's lower glycemic index pasta. Flavor from seasonings is great although I also reduced the salt. My entire family raved over this without them ever knowing about the substitutions. I have found that I can still enjoy my favorites without all the fat and calories. I agree about refrigeration one night prior for flavor and keep boiling of noodles to 5-7 min and pat dry. Keeps the lasagna from being runny. Will definitely make again!,"Made this for the 2nd time recently. The name is perfect - my husband is Italian, and this is completely different from my mother in law's lasagna, but heartier and every bit as good in it own respect. It froze well, too. I just omitted the top layer of cheese and cooked the one for the freezer 1/2 the recomended time. (A trick from the mother in law which keeps it from being watery upon 2nd baking). I then cooked it from frozen, adding that top layer of cheese for the last 1/2 hr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"I made this last week, and I decided after contemplation, that it would be simpler for me to do the entire recipe in an electric skillet, and boy was I right. :) I browned the patties and then added the soups, etc, and let it all simmer covered for about 15-20 minutes. It was so easy, and so good, though a bit salty. Next time, I will only use half of the onion soup mix, and low sodium soup. I only had one dirty pan to clean, so to me, it was awesome this way. :)","Excellent recipe. My husband loves this meal. The only change I would make is to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken. Both hubby and I didnt care for the recipe when I used the cream of chicken (didnt taste like salisbury steak). Added chopped onion to the mixture for added flavor and use ground SIRLOIN--it's the best. Also, Country Crock now makes mashed potatoes you can buy in the refridgerator isle of the grocery store, they are kind of expensive, but they are sooo good. Makes the meal even easier since you can microwave them! Goes great with the salisbury steak!",This recipe was really easy and very tasty. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it was a bit salty. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will use low sodium soup and quarter some potatoes to help with that. I browned the hamburger patties the night before. Then the next morning threw it all in the crockpot and was off to work. Thanks for the post.,This is fantastic salisbury steak. By far the best I've ever had. I cut the recipe in half and only made 4 patties. I omitted cream of chicken soup and substituted a jar of beef gravy. I also added an entire package of sliced baby portobello mushrooms. The sauce turned out wonderful but the patties were even better! Served with egg noodles and green beans. Thanks!,"What a great recipe! I used extra lean ground beef and beefy onion soup mix along with the Italian breadcrumbs and milk to make the patties. For the sauce I used two cans of reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup mixed with the whole packet of au jus and water... came out perfect, not too salty. My two boys and my husband really ate this up! Thanks for a keeper!","I have been cooking for 35+ years and this was fabulous! My husband and kids (who are very picky) cleared their plates and said I could make this ""Anytime""! I made mashed potatoes to go with this dinner - yum! I used 1/2 of the dry onion/mushroom soup mix so it would not be too salty. But it is MUCH BETTER with the CREAM OF CHICKEN then the Cream of Mushroom!!! It may sound strange, but once you add the Dry Au Jus Mix to the Cream of Chicken, it turns it to a beef flavor, not chicken. Instead of water I also added Chicken Broth. Beef broth would make it too ""beefy"". This gave it a very nice, smooth flavor. I also added a Jar of Mushrooms (drained). This is the 3rd time I've made it in a month!! Very unusual for my household. I also like it because it is so easy. Don't over mix your beef mixture, that will make it tough. If you handle with care, it will not fall apart. I love it when I find recipes that are wonderful and cooked in slow cooker/crock pot. =)","This was an excellent recipe. This was a huge hit, everyone loved it. I did not have aujus mix used 2 beef boulion cubes instead. I did use the cream of chicken soup will try cream of mushroom next time. Just because we like the mushrooms and that flavor. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.","Like other reviewers I changed up the recipe a little. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, used beef broth instead water, used gravy mix instead of aujus mix and added a few ""glugs"" of worchestershire sauce. All 3 kids and hubby loved it and it was easy to make. Will make again.","best salisbury steak ever!!! threw in some potatoes cut up small about 1 hour before hand and it came out with meat, potatoes and gravy all together:) yeah!!",I'd give this 5 stars except that I made so many changes. This is definitely a keeper! I read one reviewer that was annoyed at everyone posting their changes to the recipe but I have to say I find those reviews helpful and I'm glad people write down what they changed. I cut it in half since only two of us were eating it so I also only used 1/2 packet of onion soup mix. I added sliced mushrooms and onions. I used 1 can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the 2 cans of cream of chicken. I didn't have a packet of Au Jus mix so I used a can of low sodium beef broth. I added Worcestershire sauce to the meat. And I added my own secret weapon for gravy - Gravy Master. I love the flavor it adds to gravy! I served it with mashed potatoes and the gravy was So good the mashed potatoes were really only there as a reason to eat more of the gravy. I always thought Salisbury Steak was a lot of work. This recipe made it a snap - even on a work night. Thanks!,"We made this last night and it was very good. I made a few minor changes. Due to the other reviews regarding the saltiness of the meal, I used half the italian bread crumbs and half plain. I also used 1-1/2 cup water and added about 1/4 cup red cooking wine. We didn't think it was too salty...nowhere near too salty, but I could see how others might. Guess it depends on how much you like salt. We made it with garlic mashed potatoes and the gravy was great over that as well. We ate the leftovers today as sandwiches. Very good. We will make again.","This sounds wonderful, can't wait to try it. Just a note for those who didn't want to use Cream of Chicken soup...I'm not big on the taste of Cream of Mushroom soup in dishes (seems like when I use Cream of Mushroom or Cream of Celery that's all I can taste). I've discovered Cream of Onion soup which gives you another layer of onion flavor and the creaminess you're looking for but doesn't dominate with the mushroom or celery flavor. It also works great when you're making meat free recipies. Hope that helps someone, it did me.","This was very good. We froze the leftovers and used our vacuum saver....and the leftovers were just as good. Prep Time did take a little bit longer, but everything was great. (As another reviewer said...you do have to use lean meat.) Thanks for the post.",This is my favorite recipe from this site. I love meals that give you the feeling of down home cooking. And this one does. Great with old fashioned mash potatoes. And I made this for my sister when she was going through chemo and had no appetite. She is now healthy and makes it for herself and family. We both get requests for the recipe. Don't change a thing if you make it and you will be very pleased with the results.,"I make this recipe a lot, but I double it to feed my large family. Because I found it a bit too salty, I reduced the onion soup mix and the au jus mix by half. It's still good, and brings the saltiness down to an acceptable level for me. The recipe freezes very well, and if I'm in a rush I don't use the slow cooker, putting the patties & gravy in a baking pan and baking it in the oven at 350* for about an hour. It's good that way too! One other thing, I've found it helpful to brown the patties and then remove them from the pan, put them on a layer of paper towels, and let the grease drain for a few minutes before continuing on with the recipe.","i absolutely LOVE this recipe. i have made this about 6 times now. salisbury steak is one of my favorite meals in the world and this always hits the spot. i never make a recipe word for word and this time was no different! i live in OK and never have found an au jus mix so i just get about 4 beef bullion cubes and heat that up with the water, until the bullion has disolved and i also add A LOT of worcestershire sauce (thats the one thing this recipe is lacking!). i also switch the cream of chicken soup to cream of mushroom soup. if i remember i try and add a small can of mushrooms. this time i added 1/2 of an onion and it was great. this serves 8? man i could eat this whole meal by myself!! ha","Thanks for a creative way to make great salisbury steak! I'm a ""temporary"" at-home dad, so I felt obligated to make some manly changes of my own: I used frozen hamburger patties (don't judge me), sub'd one can of cream of mushroom with the cream of chicken, and used a packet of beef stew seasoning because I didn't have au jus mix. Not even sure if it's still considered salisbury steak, but it was GREAT...green beans and mac'n'cheese rounded out the meal. If it came out too greasy for anyone, blame it on their choice of fatty ground beef--it's NOT the recipe's fault, sheesh...",For everyone that is saying that it is salty just make your own onion soup mix leaving out the salt. It is very easy and you can get the recipe just by googling it.,Add a few T worcestershire for good salisbury flavor; plain breadcrumbs and real onions instead of onion soup mix made this recipe just right and not too salty at all (as i read in other reviews). i used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and swapped one small can of beef consumme for the packet dry au jus and water combo. Delicious! Making mashed potatoes right now... Will definitely make this again.,The only thing wrong with this was it turned out to be very salty. Other than that is was pretty good.,"This recipe is our ""go-to"" for busy days. I've also used cream of celery, cream of asparagus, and cream of mushroom soup, in different combinations, all very tasty. To deal with the draining of fat from the ground beef, I cut up some potatotes and place on bottom of the slow cooker, then put the patties in a pyramid on top -- no sitting in a puddle of grease!",Use Cream of Mushroom soup & Beefy Onion Soup mix. Can cook in skillet quicker. Add mushrooms.,"Excellent, my family loved it. I didn't change a thing and it turned it great. Will be making this again.","This same recipe can be made in one hour in the oven. I place the patties in a large cake pan, pour the soup mix (without the onion soup) on top, add parsley, onions....surround it with sliced potatoes and bake....the burger bakes in the oven. No need to brown it. Mom of 4 adult children/grandmother of 10","I made this for the first time and really enjoyed it. I cooked it with half ground chuck and half ground sirloin. I did have to every once in a while take the lid off the crock pot and ""skim"" off the fat while it was cooking. I too changed the cream of chicken to cream of mushroom and used a jar of au jus gravy instead of the mix. I will be making this often, the family really enjoyed it,, served it with mashpotatoes and green beans.",Very yummy and easy to make. My 3 picky boys ate it all up. Great recipe!,"Recipe re-calculated for 4 servings. I only scanned the recipe and did not see that it called for using a slow cooker...MY bad! Too close to dinner time to back out so used electric skillet, only had mushroom soup and used less than 1/4 packet of dry soup mix. Completed all in under 30 minutes. Gravy was sinful over mashed potatoes! Totally deelish. DH took it to work for his lunch and called home to tell me the aroma from reheating it in office nuker prompted a couple requests for the recipe. Happy to oblige! VERY good! TY!!","I make this all the time - my family's favorite meal! The only change I made was to substitute 2 cans of beef gravy instead of cream of chicken soup and I add 4-5 shakes of worcestershire sauce. Tender and delicious, great with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli!","i used 1 jar of beef gravy instead of the au jux mix and water and low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of crm of chicken. i also threw in a few small whole onions, some baby carrots and about 8 small red potatoes (washed, skins on) at the beginning of cooking. cooked it for 4 to 5 hours on low and everything came out perfect! i didn't have to make anything extra, it was all in the slow cooker! will definitely make this again!!","I thought the gravy was WAY too salty, half a packet of the dry au jus mix would help cut back on the salt. The fat from the beef was difficult to separate from the gravy so I don't think I'll do this recipe in the slow cooker, it just isn't necessary and doesn't work out too well. I also didn't like the looks of the dry onions in the beef, I will use real onion next time with some spices in place of the dry onion soup mix.**I made this again and omitted the au jus mix completely, used a leaner meat and pounded the dry onion soup mix so the bits of onion would be smaller and it was perfect!","I too used mushroom soup because it made more sense than cream of chicken and added 8 oz of mushrooms. I was home, so I baked it in the oven at 300 for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. My husband said this one is a keeper.","this was my first time to make salisbury steak and i was very impressed with how easy it was. i read other reviews and tips first, and since i didn't have all the exact ingredients, make a few substitutions and also cooked it on the stovetop rather than in the slow cooker and it still turned out great! i cut the recipe in half, using only half the onion soup packet. i didn't have the au jus or the cream soup, so instead i used a can of mushroom gravy and a dry packet of brown gravy (reduced sodium). since i forgot to half it and added the full packet of gravy mix i went ahead and added the full amount of water- so i had extra sauce which is never a bad thing! I also added fresh sliced mushrooms after browning the meat, when i added the gravies. Mine didn't turn out too salty the way i made it. thank you for such a versatile and delicious recipe :) it will be a new staple in our house!",,,,
93,"This recipe couldn't be any easier to fix..a wonderful meal to prepare in a hurry but tasting like you worked long and hard! I didn't have fresh shrimp..had 2 12oz bags of frozen so thawed them first and drained off all the water; proceeded with the recipe as stated. I used just a shy tbsp. of the dijon and on the advice of others, only used 1/2 cup butter. When I got the mixture together, I didn't think there would be enough but continued to heed the repetative advice of other reviewers and stuck with half cup...am glad I did...it was plenty enough and hubby dipped his french bread in the garlic butter! I used 2 cloves of garlic and rough chopped a handful of parsley. I also added a splash of dry white wine...this was fabulous and will definitely make again..don't be shy to try it with the frozen shrimp...just dethaw first and drain off all the water. I served this over linguine.","This is very easy and tasty. I used the full amount of butter and thought it was fine because I served it over penne. However, if you don’t want extra sauce, I’d reduce the butter by half. I used extra garlic, dried parsley and frozen shrimp, thawed, shelled, and drained. I don’t really care for mustard, but used the required amount anyway. It added a little something. Had I not known that there was mustard in this dish, I wouldn’t have recognized the flavor; it was that subtle. I don’t understand how people could find it overpowering unless they used yellow mustard. I took one star off because the cook time for the shrimp is way off. I used large shrimp and they were a tad overdone at 10 minutes. ( I think they should have come out of the oven at 7-8 minutes) I can’t imagine how rubbery medium sized shrimp at 15 minutes would be.","We loved this recipe. So fast and easy. As far as some of the comments made about using less butter, I went ahead and used all the butter which I think was needed to make sure the shrimp was coated. There was a lot left over in the pan but that was o.k. We did add a light sprinkling of parmesan and old bay, which i think helped the butter cling to the shrimp. A little splash of white wine is also good in the mix.","I too made some modifications to this great recipe. I used 24 oz. of frozen shrimp, with the tail on. Used only 1 tablespoon of mustard, and I added apprx. 1 tablespoon old bay seasoning, 3 cloves of chopped garlic and 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley to the butter mix. After placing in a non stick cookie pan (with sides), I sprinkled it with a mixture (about two handfulls)of panko bread crumbs and fresh grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese. The last two to three minutes of cooking, I placed the oven on broil (just long enough to brown the tops of the shrimp). OUTSTANDING!","Wow, I was really impressed with this! Other than adding a ""glug"" of white wine I made this as stated and was very happy. It's easy to throw together, is ready in mere minutes, looks lovely on the plate, and tastes delicious! What more could you ask for? I served this with whole wheat linguine and a zucchini/yellow squash/tomato medley, then garnished the entire plate with minced fresh parsley. When my husband called to let me know he was leaving the office I started dinner and it was ready to serve when he got home 25 minutes later! The next time I make this I will get it all assembled in advance to pop in the oven at a moment's notice, especially since I think the shrimp might even benefit from the extra time marinating in all those wonderful ingredients. I will also keep this dish in mind for last minute company. Thanks for the great recipe!","I really liked this recipe! I'm only thirteen, so I'm not really taken seriously when I cook, but this made my family finally realize it! Thanks!","I've only taken the time to write 4 reviews thus far. I felt compelled to write a positive review for this dish. It is truly EXCELLENT, given the time investement and number of ingredients. This is equal (and even better) to most of the scampi dishes I've eaten in restuarants. As other reviewers, I cut the butter in half (which means you use one block of butter from your container 8 tablespoons = 1/2 cup), I added 3/4 cup of White Cooking Wine, I omitted the Parsley (since I didn't have it, and it did not affect the taste in the least). I baked for 14 minutes (without any pre-marinating -no time for it). I tossed it in with Spinach Fettucine (got to get the vegetables in somehow). It was great, wonderful smell, not overly buttery (I don't like alot of butter). Was a crowd pleaser at my home. Will definitely make again. Thank you for this RECIPE!!!!!","The main reason this is a 5* rating comes from the ease of preparation in relation to the awesome results! My boyfriend and co. devoured this last night at dinner, along with Baked Pineapple and Cheese Vegetable Soup as a starter course (see reviews). In agreement with another reviewer, I found the amount of butter excessive and cut it down to only a little over half. I also doubled the fresh parsley, tripled the garlic (as per usual:-), used bottled lemon juice (since it was all i had on hand and the lemons at the market looked HORRID...gotta love MT produce eh???) and sprinkled the shrimp with old bay, s&p before buttering them. **My shrimp were quite large, and were done in 7-8 minutes....DEFINATELY keep an eye on them, as they tend to get tough, rubbery, and dry when cooked too long. Awesome!!","This dish was quick, easy and absolutely delicious!! Wonderful flavor!! I used Grey Poupon ""Mild & Creamy"" style mustard, as others commented that the mustard taste was overwhelming. The taste of this dish was wonderful and definitely NOT too mustardy tasting. Again, absolutely delicious - this is a keeper!!","This is a great, quick, easy recipe. I used cooked shrimp, which made it even easier. I added a bit of breadcrumbs and set the oven to broil for about 3 minutes toward the end, just for a little crunch.",This dish would have been much better w/ at least half of the mustard. The mustard overpowered the garlic so I felt like I was eating mustard shrimp as opposed to garlic.,"As recommended, used half the butter. Doubled the garlic (I do in everything). Used Honey Dijon mustard I had on hand. Butterfly'd the shrimp so more exposure to the seasonings. Made ahead and let marinate in the fridge in stainless steel bowl several hours while I prepped the rest of dinner. Put the bowl on the grill for 15 minutes with the steaks. Lots of compliments!","Very yummy dish, but I did make some changes. First, I followed the advice of others and cut the amount of butter. I only used 4 tablespoons of butter and it still seemed like I could have cut it a bit more. I did only have 1/2 a pound of shrimp (instead of 2 pounds), but I wanted plenty of sauce, so kept all the other ingredient amounts the same. I used the full amount of mustard and the full amount of lemon juice and garlic. Instead of parsley, I put in some basil and oregano and added some cayenne pepper flakes for zing (we like spicy!). I also followed the advice of others and added a ""glug"" of white wine. The lemon flavor was a bit much, so I think next time I will omit it or cut it way back and add more wine. I cooked the shrimp according to the directions, but at the end I sprinkled them with parmesan cheese and broiled them for about 5 minutes. I served it over angel hair pasta with some veggies sauteed in butter and olive oil. My husband, who is pretty picky, loved it and we snarked up the whole thing. A definite keeper with the changes! As a friend says, ""yumbo!""","This recipe was AWESOME. My family said it was the best I had ever made. Now that is something since they are picky eaters. I did do a couple of things different. I used 1 stick of butter and a 1/2 can of chicken stock inplace of the 1 cup of butter. I like lemon, so I used a little bit more. The dijon mustard gave it such a great flavor as well. Also, I did not have any ""fresh"" parsley, so I just used dried. I cooked 1 lb of pasta shells in the remaining chicken stock plus water. I poured all of the shrimp scampi bake over the drained shells and mixed it up. Added salt and pepper to taste as I went along. This was very flavorful. Thanks for such a delicious recipe. Definitely a keeper for our receipe box.","The perfect recipe – delicious, fast and easy. This recipe is a keeper.","Just a recommendation to those that use ""cooking wine -- 'DON'T. As per the advice of chefs in the know, ""If you won't drink it, don't cook with it!"". Just buy a bottle of dry white wine, can be had for less than $10, and see the difference. Even if you are not a wine drinker. You are a cook or you would not be on this site.","Wow. My husband devoured this, and he's not usually enthusiastic about dishes that don't involve Italian sausage or beef. I used 3/4 cup butter rather than 1 cup, and kept everything else the same. Oh very delicious. Flavorful, with nothing standing out too much. I served over rice. The only reason we have any left is because we both got too full to continue...","Can't stop thinking about this! The only reason I looked up this recipe is because I had leftover cooked angel hair pasta & some jumbo shrimp in the freezer. I chose this one because of the unusual addition of dijon as well as the method of baking rather than stovetop prep. OMG, we loved this! Used 1 cube of real butter & 1 lb. shrimp but left everything else as written, although didn't bake it more than 8 to 10 minutes...Garnished with a quick grind of black pepper & a bit of fresh chopped basil. If I had an open bottle of white wine I would've added a splash just to thin out the sauce...But as written this is DIVINE! Thank you!!!!!","Very good. I did add about 1/2c white wine and salt-free cajun seasoning. I felt it still needed just a little more flavor, which I think would have been accomplished had I halved the butter. Next time I will do that. So easy and so versatile. Definitely a keeper!","This is absolutely fabulous. I had a bag of frozen shrimp, not raw, and just put them frozen into the oven with the sauce poured over them. It took a couple minutel longer to bake. I served the shrimp on a bed of angel hair pasta. Delightful, and so easy with the oven doing the work. This is a big-time keeper.","Very tasty for such a quick and easy meal. The longest part would be deveining and deshelling the shrimp, so try to buy the shrimp already prepared. Could easily be made on a weeknight. And the dijon mustard was yummy!! :-)","I made this recipe as written except for a few exceptions. I cooked the shrimp for 5-7 minutes, then put it under the broiler for another 2 minutes. My 13-year-old son loves this recipe and says it taste better than Red Lobster's shrimp scampi.","I had to make a couple of changes and this recipe still turned out excellent. Since my supermarket didn't have fresh shrimp I had to use the frozen cooked shrimp (I defrosted them by allowing them to soak in cold water for about 10 minutes). I also used more garlic than called for because we LOVE garlic. I reduced the baking time to ten minutes. Well, it was fabulous! The mustard and the lemon gave it the perfect flavor. I would not hesitate to make this again. Not only did it taste great, but it's easy and takes no time at all to make. Everyone in my house was thrilled with it.","This was a unique twist on Shrimp Scampi... My husband and I really enjoyed this! I did take suggestions from some of the other reviews and cut back on the butter by about half. I also added a few splashes of white wine, some fresh lemon juice and red pepper flakes. I used larger shrimp than called for because I thought the medium ones might end up too chewy after all that time in the oven on such high heat. The large shrimp worked out perfectly. The Dijon mustard really adds a delicious flavor... Thanks for another recipe to add to my archives!","Recipe is quick,easy and delicious. I have made this on average of twice a month since I found it. It is an excellent dish when you want something nice after a hard days work or for serving to company. If I have'nt had lemons on hand I leave it out,still great. We always have shrimp in the freezer and all of the other ingredients. Sometimes I use half butter and half olive oil. Any size shrimp can be used just cook accordingly.Precooked shrimp can be tough,it is best to peel your own. Thanks to Kimber for sharing.",Fabulous. So easy to make. Followed the recipe to the letter and we loved it!,Great recipe - easy to fix.,"5+++ Stars . . . Living in the South offers us the opportunity to purchase Tiger Pawn shrimp fresh from the Atlantic Ocean - right off the shrimp boat. Each fall we clean and freeze approximately 150-200 lbs. of shrimp. My husband always sauteed shrimp scampi on top of the stove with lots of butter and garlic. While in Savannah, GA recently, our best friends shared this recipe with us. We had a type of cook-off with Jay preparing his scampi and our friends preparing this recipe. Needless to say, we no longer prepare shrimp scampi on top of the stove!!! Served over angel hair with a salad and hot bread from the oven makes this one of the family's favorite meals. Jay and our 21 y/o son, Jess, beg for me to prepare this at least 2-3 times a week . . . I reserve the recipe for 'special' Saturday evenings and often include a New York Strip grilled. Thank you so much for this recipe . . . the ingrediants blend so nicely! For Thanksgiving, we're taking frozen shrimp to Illinois and will be sharing this dish with our family! Would not change a thing in this recipe. Thanks again - absolutely marvelous!!! Impressing company meal; however, do not want to share our shrimp! LOL",This is amazing as is! Use the sauce for dipping. I can't believe how good this is and I didn't have any lemon but besides that I followed the recipe exactly.,,,,,,,

96,"Absolutely AWESOME!!! The prep couldn't have been easier, and the house smelled wonderful all day. To save others some time, I read most of the 150+ reviews, and here are the most consistent suggestions that I believe made the recipe: 1) Use a chuck roast instead of rump, as it shreds better (and is cheaper!). 2) Subsitute beef broth for the water 3) Double the salad dressing mix 4) After shredding the beef, put it back in the crockpot to cook an additional half hour to soak in the juices. I only used a 2 1/2 pound chuck roast, but I used the amount of spices called for a 5 lb. one, and it was just perfect. I cooked on low for 10 hours, and around the 8 hour mark I took the meat out to shred it and it was so easy, it practically fell apart. I put it back in and it cooked for another hour and a half along with a couple pepperoncini before we finally got to eat. I served on toasted hoagie rolls with a bunch of optional toppings....sauteed mushrooms, red onion, sliced pepperoncini and sliced roasted red peppers. Then ran the sandwiches under the broiler to melt the extra sharp provolone cheese. My husband was in heaven and if we weren't already married I think this sandwich would have gotten me a proposal! I had never heard of Italian Beef before, but this recipe makes me want to visit Chicago to try theirs! Thank you for another permanent in our meal rotation!","Tasty and flavorful, as well as easy to make. There is an error in the list of ingredients: it calls for a 4.7 oz package dry Italian salad dressing mix. That would be way too much seasoning. The correct amount is a 0.7 oz package.","Originally from the Chicago 'Burbs, I've been looking for a good Italian Beef Sandwich recipe for AGES... and this one is the BEST I've found, by far! It tastes almost exactly like the ones I used to get ""back home""... plus it's sooooo easy to make in the crockpot! I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted beef broth for the water and added 2 packages of the italian salad dressing mix. I also added a few sliced green peppers to the crockpot an hour or so before it was done. When it was done, I removed the peppers, shredded the beef, and then returned the shredded beef back to the liquid in the crockpot. I then served the shredded beef and peppers on toasted hoagie rolls. My husband and I were in HEAVEN!! :) Oh, and here's a tip -- make sure you DON'T drain the meat before placing it on the rolls -- the liquid has an AWESOME taste, so make sure you get plenty of it on your sandwich for the best flavor. In Chicago they say ""the wetter, the better"" when it comes to Italian Beef Sandwiches!!","Made these changes: omitted salt, substituted onion powder for onion salt, used 2 dressing mixes, added 1 1/2 tsp. dried onion, and added 2 beef bouillion cubes to the water. Cooked on low for about 14 hours; shredded meat and refrigerated meat and juice separately overnight. In the morning, I skimmed the fat off the juice, and returned the juice & meat to the slow cooker, along with some chopped green pepper, on high to reheat for a couple hours. Served with horseradish and provolone cheese. Was a hit at our family reunion! Leftovers (if any!) reheat well for a quick lunch.","I moved from Chicago, and the thing I miss most is the food! This is a great recipe for the Chicago food blues. I, too, used the 2 pks of dressing mix (I even use the Italian dressing mix on this site), crushed red pepper, the juice (~1/8 c.) of some sweet and hot peppers, and sliced peppers and onions and serve it on warm Italian bread with mozzarella cheese (with the peppers and onions). The best thing to do is to have it cook in the slow cooker until it is cooked through, then slice it thinly and return it to the juice for about an hour (just like they do at the beef restaurants). It was a hit at my daughter's family birthday party, and took hardly any effort. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!","This recipe was good as is,but I now use it combined with 3 other recipes for french dip and it is great,I use all of the ingredients in this recipe except use only 2 cups of water and leave out both the salt and onion salt,I add 2 cups onion sliced thin sauted in 1/4 cup butter ,1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 can coke[do not use diet or an off brand] 1 12 oz. can dark beer, 1 can beef broth, 1 can condesned french onion soup [campbells is best] I use the zesty soup mix. I try to get at least a 5 to 6 pound roast rump is o.k. if its choice otherwise I use a sirlion tip roast, this is much cheaper and less fat than a regular sirlion. I also add italian seasoning, basil, oregano,thyme,and white pepper. I slice the meat very thin like a french dip. update I have started leaving the water out and adding another can of low sodium beef broth.","Made this for a casual supper last night and all who ate it said it was the best beef sanwich ever. I followed advice of others and used 2 cups beef broth and one cup water; also two packages of Italian dressing mix. My butcher suggested a chuck roast as it shreds more easily for sandwiches. Slow cooked it and served with optional provolone cheese, thin-sliced red onion, mustard/mayo sauce and horseradish. Buy really good fresh rolls. Soooo yummy and sooo easy - THANKS!","While the beef was moist and tender, there was way too much salt and pepper to make the broth suitable for dipping. I ended up diluting it with about 2 cups of water. Next time I'll eliminate the salt (canned broth is salty enough)and cut the ground pepper in half. Otherwise, the Italian beef taste was definitely there and very good. For the person in Phoenix, try Luke's at 16th Street and Indian School for their Italian beef. It's the closest thing I've found to the real stuff. A suggestion for another reviewer: If you want the beef sliced rather than shredded, make it the day before. After a night in the fridge, slice it across the grain and gently warm it in the broth.","This is fantastic! I've had so many people request this recipe. I'm really glad I found this recipe. I grew up in Chicago where you can order this anywhere you can buy pizza or a hot dog, but here in Phoenix no one has ever heard of it. It's my little taste of home. This is even better when you replace the water with chicken broth.","The first time I made this it came out tough but the problem was my slow cooker cooks in increments of 4, 6, 8, & 10 hours and I was in a hurry and cooked at 8 hours so the meat was tough and hard to pull. I have perfected my technique and now I have to say that this is a 5* recipe and actually better than some Chicago places. I was born and raised in Chicago (Near North side, NOT the suburbs) and know Italian beef sandwiches. These are better. 1. I use only beef broth instead of water. 2. I use extra Italian dsg than what it calls for. Double 3. I add lots of sliced green peppers about an hour before the 10 hours are up. 4. I shredd the beef and put it back into the cooker with its juices and peppers and let it soak for a half hour at least. Stirring on occasion. 5. Serve with fresh french bread. 6. I start this a 8am and by 7pm we have a fantastic dinner. My entire family and friends love these sandwiches and we are all Chicagoans. This is an awesome easy recipe to make for when you have many visitors. *****",This is a great recipe! Made sandwiches 'french-dip' style. Will make again.,"I made this recipe using a venison roast and my family thought it was better than any they've ever had from a restuarant. I took the advice of previous reviews and used 2 packages of dressing mix and 1 can of low sodium beef broth in place of the water. I cooked the roast on high for 5 hours, shredded the meat with forks, then cooked an additional hour. I toasted some big kaiser rolls and added provolone cheese to the sandwiches. Definetely will make again.","Instead of water, I used two cans Campbell's beef broth--I wanted more flavor than water would have given it plus I'm cleaning out my pantry. I also eliminated the salt and I made my own dry italian-style salad dressing mix. Before adding the roast, I layered the bottom of my crockpot with sliced onions and minced garlic and I braised my roast. I used thick rolls that I slathered with garlic butter and threw under the broiler slightly before piling on the meat and provolone cheese and putting it under the broiler again. This was good but we all agreed that we like the italian beef with the peppers a little more. LOTS of spice and flavor which we all thought was quite tasty--the two grownups just missed the peppers. I appreciate this recipe because when you have a piece of beef that's been sitting in the freezer, it can be quite tough if you don't slow cook it. This not only helped me make quick work out of dinner, it saved my meat so I could use it afterall.","I have nothing much to add to the already great reviews. Did all the common ideas ..omitted salt, used onion powder instead of onion salt, used beef broth (hence the no salt added), used a 3.5 lb roast and same amount of everything else. It did smell and taste fantastic. Made it for Super Bowl. Perfect pick for that. The only thing I must add... is 17 y.o. daughter walked through the kitchen at 11 am, jerked her right thumb at the kitchen counter (crockpot) and says ""Whatever is in that thing smells really good and I just might taste some"". And unfortunately, that for me, is the highest praise I'll ever get. Oh and btw, she actually ate it. Really good. Love, Mom","We loved this recipe. I used 2 pkgs of italian dressing, 2 cans low sodium beef broth, and left out the bay leaf. I cooked the meat on low for 10 hours in the crockpot. I then shredded the meat with a fork and placed it back into the crockpot to let meat soak up the juices. My husband and I put garlic butter on the rolls and placed them in the oven at 450 for 10 minutes. Then sauted peppers and onions in olive oil to put on the sandwiches. The order of our sandwiches was: roll, meat, peppers & onions, and cheese. We placed our sandwiches in the oven at 450 until cheese melted. Thanks for this recipe, it was wonderful!","I'm gonna commit a cardinal sin & give a (5-star) review even though I made a few changes...Used a 5lb. chuck roast, 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning (just a shortcut, same herbs), & instead of water I used a can each of condensed french onion soup, consomee & beef broth. Added the 1 packet of dressing mix & a small can of pickled carrots w/ jalapeno. After the beef was oh so tender I shredded it & returned it to the crock pot. Made the sammies by pulling the meat right from the juices & served with sauteed onions, garlic & peppers on french rolls w/ melted provolone cheese. It was the recipe that gave me the idea & the blend of seasoning was delish. I just believe that the beef broths added a depth (if you will) & richness that would be lacking, & I really liked the bit of tang from the pickled carrots/jalapenos. Yum yum great - thoroghly enjoyed by all!","Oh boy have I stumbled on something. I did substitute more beef broth (2 cups) and added a 2nd seasoning packet of Italian as recommended. When ready to serve, place meat on an open faced piece of bread (hoagie style), then add a few sliced up peppercini's. On top of that, I added swiss on some, provolone on others. Stuck them in a 400 oven for 5-10 minutes to melt the cheese and crisp up the bread. Wow was that a great way to serve these. I used the reserve juice and served it au jus style. Got such good compliments and it dressed it up enough for company at an Oscar party!!","Not very impressive, I used beef broth and two packets of Italian and it was still kind of bland! It was too expensive to make for the result we got. so disappointed","After trying this recipe, you may just think twice about ordering Italian Beef sandwiches from a fast food restaurant. I recommend using grass fed beef obtained right from the farmer (if you have access to a Farmer's Market or know a good meat guy). This beef is by far beefier tasting than than factory farmed grocery store beef. I use extra pepper and garlic in the gravy and add several handfuls of sliced bell peppers (assorted colors) and onions around the roast before pouring the gravy in. Also using low sodium *good* beef stock/broth makes for an even more flavorful gravy than using water. The addition of peppers and onions makes this recipe THE BOMB!!!","Great recipe although I did make a few changes. I used 2 cups of beef broth in place of the water, double all the herbs and salad dressing and cooked on low (makes it so much more tender) also once shredded I returned the beef for a further hour of cooking. added 2 seeded Jalapenos for a little extra bite. Great recipe, its my families favorite and I make this time and again. You really could not find a quicker, simpler, tastier dish...","Big hit at the firehouse. Use Zesty Italian-style dressing mix. Also, use beef stock instead of water. Add a small bit of red pepper flakes for a little extra depth.","This is one of the best meals I've made lately! The beef turned out sooo tender and juicy and the flavor was outstanding. Based on other reviews the changes I made were to substitue beef broth for the water and I used 2 pkgs of Italian dressing mix instead of one. I cooked it for 8 or 9 hours, shredded it, then put it back in the juices for another 1-1/2 hours. I served it on hoagie rolls with swiss & provolone cheese and toasted it under the broiler. Then we topped it off with sauteed mushrooms, peppers and onion. This is a definite keeper and received raves from the guys. A tip- if there's any leftovers (I'll always make extra just to be sure!) Try using this beef to make the ""Shredded Beef Enchiladas by Christy"" from this site. That makes another *awesome* meal.","I am originally from Chicago and have been dying for REAL Chicago grub. Though it's not the thinly sliced beef that I am used to from up north it tastes just the same! It is a great dish and my wife and I make it now almost monthly! Only suggestion is to premix all the dry ingredients together the night before. That way, in the morning before you head off to work, you drop in the roast, sprinkle the dry over it and pour over the water. Fire up the slow cooker and just wait for the end of the day for a hot sandwich of nostalgia.","My boyfriend and I thought this was awesome. I cannot comment on if it tastes like italian beef because I have never had it, but it was really great as a sandwich. I know everyone has their own personal tastes, but I have read several reviews that say this is bland even when they use the beef broth and the extra seasoning packet. I may have a suggestion on how to make the meat more flavorful. Each time I have made this, I always cook it overnight for about 8 hours, then shred it when I wake up, put it in the fridge before I leave for work, and then warm it back up when I get home. I know that kind of takes away from the convenience of having something ready and hot when you get home, but I can almost guarentee this will not be ""lacking flavor"" if this is done. Maybe the meat just needs to marinate in its shredded form to get the flavor into the meat. Just a suggestion. Very tasty, thank you for sharing. We like ours with provolone cheese, jalepenos, and banana peppers. Sometimes I will saute onions and green peppers... lots of toppings you can use for this!","Excellent recipe! Aside from being extremely easy and flavorful, we were able to use the leftovers for several other meals. Day 1 we made sandwiches and Day 2 we pan fried some of the left overs and used it on tacos. My husband ate his tacos on corn tortillas with the beef, onion, and cilantro while I added refried beans and cheese. Both were excellent. Day 3 I made a lazy version of beef stroganoff with the meat thrown in. Great easy recipe. We'll make this again.",Absolute best Chicago Italian Beef clone that I have tried. I was born and raised in the Chicago area and now reside on the east coast (waa waa). I miss Italian Beef Sandwiches!!! This recipe is the closest. Get your self some hot gardinera peppers and have at it. A little bit of Chicago right in your own home. Or top off your sandwich with mozzarella cheese and you have a chief. Nice this is da best!,"Ok, I'm from Chicago. While this is not true Italian Beef sandwich it's close enough. I doubled all the spices and marinated overnight. Browned on stovetop then Cooked on low for about 7-8 hours took out of juice and shredded then returned to crock for about half an hour. I served on warmed hoagie rolls with hot peppers. Just smelling it cook brought back memories. Try it..",This was fantastic! I did follow alot of reviews and doubled up on the spices and packets of italian dressing. I added 24 oz of beef broth instead of water and only 2 1/2 lbs of beef roast. I added strips of a green pepper to the last 4 hours of cooking but wished I had added more. Will make again!!,"Love this! I did; however, tweak it to what I have read. Replaced beef broth for water, used chuck roast, doubled the salad dressing mix. Served on toasted hoagie rolls, and topped with extra sharp provolone cheese. I throw this together in the morning and when I come in the door after work the smells are amazing (plus so easy).","This recipe is fantastic!!! I agree with ""MomSavedByGrace""'s comments: use 2 packets of Italian dressing instead of 1, use beef broth instead of water, and take the meat out early, shred it, and put it back in the juices. I also prepared our sandwiches the same as hers and everyone loved it. My daughter doesn't like any kind of meat, and neither of my kids like sandwiches, and they asked for this every day until it was gone. Very good!!!","I did everything just as the recipe called for it. The house smelled wonderful! And just before it was ready I sliced up some mushrooms, onions, and peppers and threw them in a skillet until they were cooked through and limp. Meanwhile I stuck our Hoagie rolls in the oven at 300 degrees wrapped in foil to let them soften. Once rolls were done, I placed shredded meat on a cookie sheet topped with pepper mixture and layed provolone slices over it and broiled til cheese melted. Put mayo on hoagies and put meat with goodies on the rolls and it was WONDERFUL! Sister in law just had a baby and took over some for her and hubby too! Loved it!","It was excellent but instead of a crockpot, I used a roasting pan. I heated some olive oil, rubbed the meat with salt and pepper seared the meat in the hot oil and then browned 2 large onions in the same pan then poured the seasoning over the meat and covered in foil. I cooked it for 2 1/2 - 3 hours then shredded and stirred in all of the juices and onions together. Delicious. My family could not wait; they ate it straight out of the pan",,,,

99,"Very good and tasty. Instead of forming them into individual loaves as suggested in the recipe, I used a muffin pan that I sprayed with PAM. The cooking time was the same and it was easier, too.","I wanted to try a new Meatloaf recipe other then my Mom's. I saw this recipe, and it was close to hers, but a little different (quick oats, sauce, no onion). So, I made it exactly as the recipe called for, BUT added one large chopped onion (meatloaf isn't meatloaf without onion). I found a NEW recipe. This meatloaf recipe is BETTER then Moms. My kids were licking their plates. I can't get the taste out of my mouth. It was fantastic. I already sent the recipe to my sister in law, to feed to her finicky kids. I think they'll even like it. I don't think anyone who tries this would be disappointed.",My husband wanted meatloaf for dinner so I got online to see what I could find....THIS WAS AWESOME!! I used a muffin pan like others had suggested. I like the individual serving sizes except my husband ate 9 outta 12 meatloaf muffins!!! So much for lunch tomorrow.... I stuck pretty close to original recipe but added Ms Dash's 1/2 tsp onion medley and cut back to 1/2 tsp salt. Also was just under 1/2 cup of oats so I added some italian bread crumbs too. Put about 1/4 cup chopped onions and had to add Worcester sauce cuz I love it! This really was easy to make and has me looking forward to the next time we can eat meatloaf! Thanks Tonya!!!,"Very tasty. I added some chopped sauted onions for extra flavor and used fresh bread crumbs because I didn't have oats. I left the milk also. I did make 8 loavess, but I used 1 1/2 pounds of meat. I don't know that 1 pound would have been enough meat for 8 loaves otherwise. I felt they were the perfect size and ate one. My brother was here for dinner and ate 4 though, but he is a big guy and had just come from work.","I've finally found a meatloaf recipe I love just as much as my usual recipe! I'll be switching between the two! I did add some finely chopped onion, Worcestershire and garlic powder","This was really REALLY good!! After reading alot of the reviews, this is how I changed it a bit. I did use the muffin tin sprayed with cooking spray which yielded 10 mini meatloaves after a perfect 45 minutes in the oven. I let the oats, milk and cheese sit for a few minutes to soften the oats a bit. I also added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder to the milk/oats/cheese mix. For the topping I used dijon mustard - that countered the sweetness just right and made the perfect topping! This recipe is top notch!! My husband - the avowed meatloaf hater - ate SIX of them (and yes he was moaning on the couch afterward). That's a winner in my book!","Very clever recipe that was appealing to everyone! The kids liked having their own personal meatloaf and my dh even preferred it over the one giant lump of meatloaf. It looked so much prettier to serve on a plate too! I have to admit, I didn't have oats so I used regular saltine crackers and I didn't want the mustard in it so I left that out, but it was a fantastic recipe. I used a measuring scoop as a mold. A keeper!","I have tried several highly rated meatloaf recipes on this site, but this is my new favorite. It produces a tender and tasty meatloaf. I made the following modifications. I tripled the recipe and substituted 1 lb of ground lamb for 1 lb of ground beef. I made one batch of mini's in a muffin tin and instead of adding the cheese into the meat I formed the ball of meatloaf around a chunk of cojack cheese. Yummy, yummy! The other two loaves I mixed the cheddar cheese into and baked them regular size. Finally, I did not add the mustard to the topping; I don't like mustard. So I added a bit of onion powder and cut back on the sugar a bit. Anyway, awesome recipe!","I made this one last night and I now have a favorite meatloaf recipe! My husband loved it ~ there were no leftovers. I have a new baby and this was easy to make up while he was napping and shove in the fridge for a few hurs, and pop in the oven when ready to cook. I ended up with 6 mini loaves, and I just added a pinch of regular sugar to the sauce (no brown sugar) and it was perfect, not too sweet at all. I added some garlic salt to the mix as well. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of oats. I will definitely make this one again.",make the meatloaf with seasoned bread crumbs. this taste like an oatmeal cookie with meat.,"Ideal for kids and freezes well! I make these for my sons’ lunch all the time. I use the ingredients as per the recipe BUT put the individual potions in a muffin pan greased with PAM. I have a simple food scale and make 3 oz patties. I add the sauce equally over all the portions. Obviously, I make these when the little ones can have it as a meal. But this recipe is so easy to make in a big batch, that I can make more and freeze them in individual containers (two per container in this case) that can be sent to school with him for a reheat. UPDATE: My boys were getting tired of big meat patties. I now actually just scoop one tablespoon of the mixture, roll it into a meatball and then when all the meatballs are formed in a oven safe dish, I just dress them with the sauce. Bake for only 30 minutes and watch them gobble them up. Also served as appetizers and people who did not like meatloaf gave me compliments!","We loved this. Like others, I mixed the milk, egg, salt, and oatmeal and let it sit while I prepared the rest. I added half a small chopped sweet onion and a little pepper. I divided the mixture evenly into my 12-muffin-tin and shook a little garlic powder over the top. Then I spooned about 2 teaspoons of the catsup sauce over the top of each ""muffin."" I put them in the oven, and after about half an hour, I took the then-meatballs from the muffin tins, tossing out the grease, and put them upside down on a foil-lined pan. I covered them with the rest of the catsup mixture and returned them to the oven for the remaining cooking time (about 20 minutes more). These were so great! I'll make up some more tomorrow and freeze them for a lazy-day dinner later on this month! Great recipe! Thanks!","These were good. I used a jarred pasta sauce instead of the ketchup, but other than that I didn't make any changes. Will make again. Thanks for the post.","This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe. I've always been a meatloaf fan, but DH could take it or leave it. Out of all of the meatloaf recipes I have used, he eats more of this one though. I had never put oats or cheese in meatloaf before, but I love the texture of this meatloaf. I just make it into one loaf and slice it up. I do add dried minced onion, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. Best part about it.....meatloaf sandwich for lunch tomorrow! I will make this recipe over and over.","I did these a little differently. Used 1/2 cup each evap. cond. milk and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, half the cheese, ketchup, salt and brown sugar, and added garlic powder, dry mustard and worcestershire all to the meat mixture. Put in prepared muffin cups and baked for 30 min. and then topped with flakey refrigerator biscuits (split in half). Continued baking for about 6 min. longer, till biscuits were done. Delicious, and thanks!","These were excellent. I made them for work lunches so the mini-style suited tupperware well. The sauce on top of the meatloaf is great, and I added a few extra oats for healthy fiber. I also accidentally used old-fashioned oats, not quicking cooking ones, and it didn't make a bit of difference. They were still delicious.","Wow - what an amazing recipe!! Me and my husband loved this dish! (We used antelope burger - so it is game friendly too!) The sauce as perfect for me, but hubby thought there was a little too mutch ketchup flavor. Will only add 1/3 cup ketchup next time... Maybe even less of sauce all together - was way too much. I found it easier to make 6 mini-loafs than 8. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it is going in our dinner rotation!",My husband requests this meal at least once a month!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

101,"I made this last night and it was delicious. Used a prior reviewer's suggestion and made it in a round 2-qt casserole dish instead of a 9x13-inch pan, to avoid having a dry casserole (other than that I followed the recipe exactly). Like previous reviewers have commented, it was just a tad on the dry side. Wasn't so dry that my fiance and I didn't enjoy eating it (it was really tasty!), but could use about half a can more soup. I used red onions which made for a colorful dish. I will definitely be making this again - it's a keeper - but next time I'm going to add 1/2 can more soup to it.","Overall the receipe is very good. As indicated by others, it was dry. Considering using a whole bag of noodles, I did add another can of soup and 1/2 cup of milk. Next time I make this, I think I will add sour cream in addition to the extra can of soup and milk, the mixture really needs to be pretty soupy when baked, since the noodles soak up so much of the liquid. Where did the cayenne pepper substitute come from, I didn't see it in the receipe, although it would be a good addition. Thanks for the recipe.","Very Good! I usually just ""wing it"" when it comes to making tuna casserole, but there is a first time for everything, and I actually followed a recipe this time! As other reviewers stated, I too added some milk to make it more creamy. I then added about a 1/4 cup of miracle whip as well for a little zip, then I did my usual doctoring with onion and garlic powders. Instead of using potatoe chips on top I used crushed crackers that I pulsed a few times in the food processor with some melted garlic butter. The end reult was a very yummy tuna casserole.","I ENJOYED THIS TUNA CASSEROLE. I PREPARED IT FOR MY MOTHER AND I AND IT WAS ENOUGH FOR AT LEAST 6 PEOPLE. AFTER READING THE REVIEWS ABOUT THE CASSEROLE BEING DRY AND BLAND, I MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. I USED A FAMILY SIZE CAN CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP, I PUT A LITTLE EXTRA SALT IN THE BOILING WATER THAT I COOKED THE NOODLES. I MELTED 1.5 STICKS OF BUTTER IN A SAUCEPAN AND SAUTED MY ONIONS BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK 20 MINUTES WOULD GET THEM AS TENDER AS I PREFER. OF COURSE, I ADDED THAT BUTTER TO THE MAKING OF THE CASSEROLE AS WELL. I INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF ONION CALLED FOR IN THE RECIPE TO HALF OF A LARGE ONION. I USED SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE AS WELL FOR ADDED FLAVOR. I INCORPORATED ALL THE CHEESE INTO THE CASSEROLE AND JUST USED CRUSHED POTATO CHIPS ON TOP. I DID NOT DRAIN THE TUNA, I USED THE JUICE AS WELL TO HELP WITH THE BLAND TASTE THAT WAS MENTIONED IN SEVERAL REVIEWS. I REDUCED THE OVEN TEMP TO 350 DEGREES AS WELL TO KEEP THE CASSEROLE FROM DRYING OUT AS MUCH. THE RESULT WAS EXCELENT!!!","I have never been a tuna casserole fan but when I saw the name of this one, I though I HAD to give it a try! I am so glad that I did!! I used a 12oz pkg of regular shell noodles and instead of peas (I have never been a pea fan either), I used a drained jar of diced pimentos. This was indeed the Best tuna casserole I have ever had and my family agreed. Wil be making again!!","I'm not a big fan of Tuna casserole but I gave this one a try, with a few modifications it came out a 5 star recipe. My father in law told my mother in law to step aside and let me cook it from now on. He told everyone it's the best F'n Tuna casserole he's ever had.... I guess that about sums it up : ) This is what i changed, I seasoned the mixture with johnnys, I did NOT add mushrooms, I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery, i sauteed the onions in a little bit of butter and also some celery, I added some canned corn in addition to the peas and more cheese to the mixture than it calls for. Best I have ever had.","It was good. I would suggest, however, that you mix all the cheese in the casserole as it dries out to quickly on the top. Also, I used crushed herb flavored pretzels mixed with seasoned croutons instead of the potato chips and it was fabulous.","Not a big hit with my 2 year old nephew, but everyone else loved it! I doubled the tuna, added another 1/2 bag of noodles, and added a can of Cheddar Cheese Soup. I used buttered bread crumbs instead of the potato chip topping. It tasted exactly like the frozen dinner Tuna Noodle Casserole that I love!","I am not a huge fan of tuna casserole. It is always so boring, but this recipe is a great start. With a few modifications, it came it fantastic! I used 8oz of noodles instead of 12, which helped keep the dish from drying out in the oven. My family really likes onion, so I used about half of a sweet yellow, roughly chopped. I also added 1/2c sour cream and 1/4 milk to the mix. I didn't have any chips so I just used cheese as a topping, but french fried onions would be great on top. Baked in a 2qt round casserole dish for about 25 minutes at 350. You don't have to bake at such a high temperature since everything is already cooked. You only need to thaw the peas and warm the dish. With these alterations, the casserole came out moist and delicious. My husband ate about half of it in one sitting and it makes great leftovers too! We will be having this again!","This is by far the best tuna casserole I've had, and as easy as the classic. I often substitute canned salmon for tuna, or use canned asparagus as the main veggie. YUM!","This casserole is very good and quite possibly the best one of it's type that I've tasted so far! It reminds me of the tuna casserole that my grandma and mom made when I was a child, but even better!!! This is perfect for kids!!! I omitted the mushrooms since I don't like them. This goes well with a tall, cold glass of milk and oreos for dessert, or if time allows, a Jell-O salad (i.e. cherry cola Jell-O salad) & homemade brownies. Yum! Yum!","I am giving this recipe 4 stars because, while it was delicious, I had to make the suggested changes to make it work. I took advice from varying reviews, and added a little macaroni and cheese know-how, and ended up with a great casserole! There wasn't a dry noodle in the house. Here's what I did: - Chopped up about 2/3 of a red onion and sauteed in the pan. When onions were nearly done cooking, I added about 6 sliced Baby Bella mushrooms and sauteed for a few minutes. - Meanwhile, I poured 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup in a pan. Filled each can with milk and added that as well. I brought the mixture to a boil, shut off the heat, and added about 2 1/2 to 3 cups of shredded cheese (extra to compensate for the milk). I stirred the cheese in until a cheese sauce was formed, adding salt and pepper along the way. - I then mixed the cheese sauce into the noodles, along with the tuna, onions, mushrooms and frozen veggies. Once everything was coated, I covered in flavored bread crumbs and baked. - The end result.... A+!!!!","This recipe is a good. It is fast and easy to fix. It might be a little bland and it does taste very similar to a Tuna Helper meal but has the homemade appeal instead. I used crushed corn flake cereal dredged in butter for the top since I had no potato chips on hand and it worked okay but I would definitely try the chips if I were to make it again. All in all, this is a good recipe with simple ingredients right out of the pantry. It is a recipe that will turn out just average.",This is an exceptional tuna casserole...HINT: I mixed in one cup of sour cream before baking. This eliminated ANY dryness anyone else has experienced!!! Try the sour cream. Makes it incredibly creamy!!,"I always feel bad altering a recipe... I mean following it is what makes it a recipe! I was having a hankering for tuna casserole and needed a base recipe. This worked perfect, and I loved the suggestions everyone else had too. To make this ""my family"" friendly, I omitted the mushrooms, onions and peas (lol) and instead used 2 cups of frozen chopped broccoli. I also put in a cup of sour cream, cayenne pepper, garlic salt and used sharp white cheddar cheese. For the top I skipped the cheese and just used crushed croutons and it was so good!! I highly recommend this recipe, either as written or doctored up. Its a really simple, delicious one!","I made this for dinner last night and it was excellent. I read the reviews first and made the following changes: 1. sauteed the onion with a little minced garlic before adding, 2. used mixed veggies instead of peas (family preference), 3. baked in a round 2 qt casserole instead of a 9x13 dish, 4. whisked the 2 cans of soup with one can of milk before adding and seasoned the soup with salt and pepper, 5. mixed most of the cheese in and sprinkled just a little on top, 6. topped with crushed whole grain Ritz instead of potato chips (family preference), 7. used whole grain egg noodles (family preference), 8. baked at 375 for 15 minutes covered, then 425 for 10 minutes uncovered. It was moist, creamy, and delicious. It may have needed a little more veggies and tuna, but that's personal preference.","I did read over the reviews before trying this out myself and i am glad i saw that it does dry out a little bit. So the only thing i did extra was add a half can of cheddar cheese soup (or sour cream if cheddar cheese soup is not in pantry). and since i didn't have any potato chips or crackers, i improvised and used the canned french's fried onions. DELICIOUS!!!! Thanks for the recipe!","This is my second time making it. The first time, I gave it 3 stars because it was bland and dry. The second time, I tweaked it. MUCH better. First I added a clove of garlic, an extra can of soup AND some sour cream. I also added some dill weed. Dill makes tuna and salmon taste SO much better. I have no idea why. I also used green beans instead of peas because I hate peas.","After clicking through different tuna casserole versions and reviews, I picked this one, and I've made it numerous times - putting a different spin each time based on what's in the fridge/pantry. ALWAYS turns out FABULOUS. I think that the real beauty of this recipe is it's openness to interpretation. (Say you're in the middle of a snowstorm, like we are right now, and you have the main ingredients and some others...) Tonight I had no egg noodles (used penne), no peas (used steamed broccoli florets) and happened to have on hand some fresh basil, chicken broth and cooking sherry, so I threw those in with the 2 cans condensed soup. I added Parmesan cheese and lemon juice and zest to the sauce. It came out less like a casserole in density, since it didn't stick tight together, but HOLY COW was it DELISH!!!! Definitely this version is going in the permanent rotation! THANKS for the great recipe! One other tip: I make the whole thing in one pot - saute the onion, carrot, celery and mushroom in a dutch oven on the stove top. Stir in the frozen peas (or brocc or whatever green veggie you prefer - asparagus would be yummy too!), stir in all the other ingredients and pop the whole thing in the oven with the lid on for the first 20 mins, off for 10. You can fit the volume of added healthy veggies and tuna if you're using the dutch oven rather than the 13x9 pan. Makes AWESOME leftovers for DAYS.","This was a very good dish, although, like many have said, it was rather dry. If I were rating this dish the first time that I made it-following the recipe exactly, I would have given it two stars, but I wanted to give it a chance since so many people liked it. The second time I made some changes so the 5-star rating is based on making it with my changes. I sauteed my onions in butter and fresh garlic and I added a cup of milk to the sauce before adding it to the noodles. I also really loved the potato chips on the top.","This was a better than average tuna casserole, but is definitely not the best, mainly because it is so incredibly bland. I halved the recipe since hubby doesn't eat tuna. I knew going in that I would need more spice so I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of coarsely ground black pepper and a 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Even with those additions and all of the salt in the soup, cheese and potato chips, I still had to add extra salt and pepper upon serving. I also didn't think there were enough peas. Next time I make this, I intend to double the peas, add 1.5 tsp. of garlic salt, more pepper, the cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes. I also think it would work well to makes this with shredded chicken for the fish haters. Good base recipe - it just needs more seasoning to be really good.","Other reviewers said it was dry, so I added 1/2 cup of milk and another can of cream of mushroom blended together before mixing. I also used a can of peas drained instead of frozen.Turned out fantastic!! Glad I added the extra cream of mushroom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,"Very yummy. I think the variance in reviews between liking it and saying it is too sharp and vinegary could be due to the quality of balsamic vinegar used. Good quality balsamic is so mild you can eat it straight off a spoon and it is almost sweet. Inexpensive balsamic might as well be plain white vinegar. So don't be thrifty on the vinegar quality, you'll only regret it.","Such simple ingredients for such phenomenal taste. Absolutely delicious! Definitely 5 stars as written, though the 2nd time I made this I reduced the vinegar down to 1/3 of a cup for hubby's sake..... For a change of pace, try adding green onions and fresh minced garlic to the mix and letting the roast marinate overnight.","Excellent! It's a shame that the previous reviewer chose to toss the tenderloin out due to the ""vinegery"" smell, because it produced one of the better pork tenderloins ever for me. But then, I really enjoy the flavor balsamic vinegar lends. I say try it (if you like that strong flavor too) because I really didn't think it was overpowering at all....in taste or smell! Thanks for the recipe!","I made this last night and it was awesome. I made just a couple changes. I used 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 white whine. I also added a squeeze of honey and a clove of pressed garlic. After marinading, i put into a 9 x 13 baking dish and poured all the marinade in with it. I put in one large chopped onion, 4 medium yukon gold potatoes cut up, 4 carrots cut in sticks and two stalks of celery cut up. I layed them right down on top of the marinade in the pan and kind of mixed them around a bit to soak up the juices. I then sprinkled with rosemary, salt and pepper. I baked on 350 for 45 min in a foil tent, then cranked up the heat to 450 and took the foil tent off. I cooked the roast for 10 min this way, then took out to rest & wrapped in foil. Then I stired the veggies around in the juices and then put them back in the 450 oven for about 15 more minutes. THIS WAS FANTASIC. Everything had a wonderful glaze to it. The meat was moist and oh so good. :) Thanks for the great starter recipe! :)","Simple ingredients, great results. No need to change or add a thing. The roast turns out incredibly moist and tender and the juices reduce to a deep, rich, and flavorful ""balsamic reduction,"" right in the oven!","Made this tonite it's a keeper. MY hubby and kids loved it. Added Garlic lots of garlic, also scraped pan added dry white wine and made gravy, thou it was moist enough already. THIS DID NOT TASTE LIKE VINEGER!!!!!","My family loved this pork loin roast, it's the best we've ever had. I added 1/4 cup of honey to the marinade and cooked it until it was 160 which was perfect. With carry over cooking it ended up at 165. Perfect!","I made this with a dusty (and I do mean covered in dust) old half-gone cheapity-cheap bottle of Cento balsamic vinegar that I've probably owned for 3 or 4 years. Shameful, I know. But I say all that to say that...WOW WOW WOW. You probably don't have to worry too terribly much about the quality or price of the vinegar. This was SO incredibly good. And the whole house smelled fantastic while cooking. And my 3, 4 and 8 year olds gobbled it down, also. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut two yellow onions into thick slices and lined the bottom of the baking dish with them. This was absolutely the way to go. Those onions were perfectly cooked, drenched in the yummy sauce, and my husband and I heaped them all over the meat. Just writing this review makes me want to go back to Trader Joe's right now to get another roast...annnnd *maybe* a new bottle of balsamic vinegar.","I marinated the pork loin as instructed, but cooked it on the grill instead of in the oven... 20 minutes over direct medium heat, followed by 40 minutes on indirect medium heat. It was scrumptous.","My family loved this easy recipe. The pork was so tender!! I cubed sweet potatoes, sprinkled a little olive oil on them and added to the pan. Great meal!!!","Excellent! I added about 1T Canvender's Greek Seasoning and 4 crushed garlic cloves to the marinade. Moist and Delish. Use a meat thermometer for best results, 145 is great because it will continue to cook, do not cover. Again, very good.","This is the best pork I've ever made. We too love the smell and taste of balsamic vinegar, so we loved the smell and the taste. I had company the first time I tried it, the adults loved it, the kids loved it, and I was asked to make it again soon. This is the only way I'll make a pork roast again. I only marinated it for 2 hours due to time. Don't know if that made a differece or not, but I will do it the same way when I make it today.","I love the taste of balsamic vinegar, so this recipe was right up my alley. Added 3 crushed garlic cloves along with a little salt and pepper to the marinade - Perfect! I have also noticed some discussion about the temperature to cook the meat. On May 24, 2011 the USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here’s what you need to know: When Cooking Whole Cuts of Pork USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender. So anything above 145 ºF is safe after a 3 minute rest period. Then it is just a matter of taste. I use the following as a rule of thumb: 145 ºF yields a wonderfully juicy Medium Rare, 155 ºF produces a solid Medium Well and 165 ºF creates a dusty Well Done. These temperatures are out of the oven temperatures and still need the rest period. Thanks for a great tasting recipe.","This was fantastic. Cooked to an internal temp of 150 (perfect)! Marinated for about 3 hours and used ""Regina"" Balsamic Vinegar and Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick.. Some people recommended placing pork on a bed of onions so the bottom would not burn (good idea), and added 1/4 cup of water and some white wine so as to create some gravy later (good idea). Very very tender.","This recipe is super easy! I've substituted red wine vinegar, and I like that way better, but you can't go wrong with this recipe. The pork is juicy and delicious!",This is unbelieveable! Tender and moist. I do not like vinegar or anything sour - so I figured I would just eat something else when I served this . It is the best pork loin I have ever had. We could not stop eating. Like other reviews I added 1/3 cup honey to marinade and placed big thick slices of yellow onion under the roast. Then topped off my plate with the onions. My husband raved and raved...I'm raving too. For the steak seasioning I used Montreal Steat Grill Mates. Thank you for this now family favorite!!!!!,"Have made this recipe many times now. It always turns out great. My husband tells me every time that its worthy of being served in a fine restaurant. A little trick that I learned, is if you take the leftover marinade after the roast is cooked, strain out the seasoning, add 1/4 cup brown sugar and boil for a few minutes, you get a wonderful glaze to pour over the cut pieces. Truly a simple and wonderful recipe!","Very tasty, and simple. Just a note to the person that gave this a low review but did this in a slow cooker. All slow cookers are not alike, and I think the word slow cooker can be deceiving. I too have had things come out dry in the slow cooker, but usually from cooking to long to where you simply cook the moisture out of the meat. I think timing is so important in the slow cooker, and adding some chicken broth may help some. Chicken broth and pork go great together. I would try this recipe in the oven as it is posted here first, you might be pleasantly surprised. I always follow a recipe to the letter, then make changes based on my likes and dislikes.","Amazing! Oh the smell is to die for. I am a huge balsamic fan anyways. I have made this a few times and recommend a thermometer for sure. I didn't use one once and it ended up too dry. Now I cook it to 145 and pull it out. I also used a metal pan once because my only proper glass one was in use and the marinade burned to the bottom. SO USE GLASS. It doesn't burn in the glass pan. I use Weber Chicago steak seasoning. And I marinate it for about 10 hours. How could something so easy taste so wonderful! I like to make it with asparagus and I used the leftover marinade over it and the pork when I serve it. Sometimes I splash a bit more vinegar on mine, but that might not be for everyone. Like I said, I just love balsamic. My other half cant stand the smell or taste of vinegar but he is a fan of this pork.","Hate to be the one who says it's great but changes everything, and yet...this is a great recipe, but I changed a few things, and it was truly gourmet. I marinated as indicated (with my own dry rub), using organic golden balsamic vinegar: a great choice. I then took a trick from prime rib and mixed 1/2 cup flour with some spices (herbamare, garlic, onion powder), and coated the roast with the flour mixture. I then baked the roast at 450 for 15 minutes before lowering the temp for the rest of the cooking time. This left a nice, crusty outer, and a lovely, juicy meat. I used the scrapings from the pan and made a sauce by incorporating some homemade broth. I also roasted some veggies (beets) along with the meat: it was great!",The smell of vinegar was so strong while this was in the oven that I had to stop cooking it so I could throw it out and air out my house!,"I use a very similar marinade all the time. Same amounts of olive oil and balsamic vinegar but I add a couple Tbsp each of dijon mustard and honey, several sprigs of fresh thyme and 3 or 4 cloves of crushed and chopped garlic. When I want to spice things up a bit I'll add a Tbsp of crushed red pepper plus juice and zest of 1 lime. I always marinate overnight and salt and pepper the meat before putting it in oven or on the grill. I use this marinade for pork, chicken and even rib roasts. Don't be afraid to try this or to experiment and make it your own. Excellent marinade, thanks for sharing, Melissa.","This was a great recipe. I always have trouble with my pork loin -it never seems to come out tender enough for my young toddler (15months old) to chew -so we eat tenderloin mostly. There was a sale on pork loin this week and I decided to try another pork loin and this recipe was amazing. I made some changes: I used 1/4 cup white wine vinegar and 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar (because we were out of my regular balsamic vinegar) I also didn't have steak seasoning, but I found the ingredients list and so I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and rosemary. I marinated it all day and then roasted it that evening -it was so tender!! I could not believe this was my pork loin!! Because I used white balsamic vinegar I didn't need to add anything to make my drippings into a wonderful sauce for the pork! The only thing I had a problem with was the temperature. Pork cooks to 170 -175, not 145 as stated in the recipe. Even with standing and tenting, that would not be cooked enough. It took me about 1 3/4 hrs for my 3lb roast to cook and I had to jack the temp up to 375 after the first hour because I was running late by that time. I'm still giving it 5 stars though!","The flavor was delicious, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the meat itself is a little tough. Update: I take it all back. I've tried a few different variation on this recipe now. The meat was only tough when I let it marinate for only two hours. When you leave it overnight or even 2 nights it gets juicy, tender, and delicious. Also, carrots, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, and pretty much any sweet vegetable taste AMAZING roasting along with this dish in its sauce.","I just had the most delicious roast pork loin thanks to this recipe! My balsamic was a bit tart, so I corrected the flavor with a bit of honey to taste. I roasted carrots and onions with the pork. Yum! Served with new potatoes sauteed in brown butter, steamed buttery hericots verts from the garden, and homemade wheat rolls, this was one memorable meal! Thank you for posting the recipe. This is so beautiful as a base marinade. Many wonderful things can be added, or it can be great as is (with a sweetish balsamic). Everyone just needs to taste the marinade before putting over the pork. If your vinegar is too sharp, the marinade is easily corrected with a little honey or brown sugar.","this was a big hit here. I see some folks had problems with it baking dry. The instructions do not say to cover with foil when baking, but I did. It did not get dry that way. I think a piece of foil is the simple solution here...no need to make more marinade or add water.","Had a very good taste to it. My wife felt the vinegar taste was a bit much. Easily fixed by adding pineapple chunks as a topping. I will be making it again, possibly adding some pineapple to the marinade. The kids enjoyed it as well.",,,,,,,,,

105,"Delicious, but needed enhancements. I added 1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper, 10 shakes of Worcesteshire, more garlic, seasoning salt, splash of light soy, dried parsley, a whole egg not just the white. (For those that say your patties fall apart..I have a trick...You add the yolk of the egg as it helps to hold the mix together even when you have them flat as possible. Also put a light coating of flour on the patties just before you cook them ensuring that you shake off the excess flour. The flour helps form a light, crusty exterior and holds the patty and makes it easier to flip.) The egg yolk and extra bell pepper meant I had to add more breadcrumbs and for those who say their mix is sticky, you should probably add more crumbs anyway. How well they hold together in you hand is how well they hold on the pan. Juicy and very tasty.","I grilled these on my George Foreman grill, however, I was concerned that the grill would cook the burgers too fast (no heat control). So what I did was put the burgers on the cold grill, then plug it in. 15 mins later, the burgers were perfect! I cooked three and froze the rest...can't wait to see how they turn out!","I am on a low cholesterol diet. I am also a carnivore. I love meat, but have been trying to cut down on fats & load up on fruit, veggies and the occasional red meat. I found this recipe to be really good with the following additions: 1) added a few drops of hickory seasoning liquid smoke 2) add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, 3) add a small, plastic package of soy sauce, leftover from a Chinese restaurant. This will guarantee that these babies will taste like beef. I tried this on my equally carnivorous roomie, who proclaimed that due to my dilgent efforts, some can be fooled into thinking they're eating a Quarter Pounder, no cheese, extra onion. Speaking of onion, shred fine with a shredder. I used parsley from my garden. Good going, Trudi!","These burgers were scrumptious! I'd take them any day over regular hamburgers! (The husband, who's a big turkey fan, adored them too). When I made them, I substituted onion powder for chopped onion, left out the garlic, and added a few tablespoons of soy sauce, a couple teaspoons of worchestershire, and a few shakes of hot sauce. I also used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt. And I used italian-style bread crumbs. I put these on the grill, and sprinkled a little garlic powder and a little more worchestershire sauce on them as they cooked. I served them topped with lettuce, red onion, ketchup, and mustard, and they were so flavorful and juicy! Some other users said they added mushrooms to keep the burgers from being dry, but i found that the worchestershire will do the job just fine, and adds better flavor!","I tried this recipe three times...the first time I followed the directions exactly as written and thought that the burgers came out pretty good. The second time (after taking the advice of other users) I added a splash of liquid smoke, a splash of worcestershire sauce, and a splash of soy sauce. This recipe was a little tastier. The third time was definitely the best....instead of 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, I used 3/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs. I used one whole egg instead of two egg whites. I omitted the teaspoon of salt and added 2 Tablespoons of soy sauce instead. I added the splash of liquid smoke and worcestershire. Instead of trying to peel and mince the clove of garlic, I added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic out of the jar. The rest of the recipe (onion, parsley, pepper) I kept the same. Finally...I tried to pan fry the first two times, but grilled them on the BBQ the third time....10X better flavor! The one thing I learned is that you MUST spray the hell out of the grill with Pam to keep the patties from sticking.","Delicious! I used fresh bread crumbs (this helps with the dryness problem others complained of) and seasoned it with a little bit of Italian seasoning. They were really juicy. I was also careful to shape them gently (with a slight indentation in the center so that it would not ""puff"") and not press down on them during cooking, so they retained more juices.","I have now made this recipe twice, and it was delicious both times. The first time I had enough left over to make a meatloaf as well. I combined some tomato sauce, brown sugar, salt and worcestshire sauce and poured it over the loaf in the pan before baking it. It was great. I would highly recommend this recipe to someone who may have tried turkey for burgers, but were turned off by the bland texture and taste. This recipe overcomes all those issues, and is lowfat and healthful, too. Thanks for the recipe.","I add a generous sprinkle of McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on top of the patties, and they are perfect. Works well for turkey or beef. Also, I used Egg Beaters, and could not tell the difference.",Add worchester sauce and seasoning salt. These were very good!!!,"There are delicious. You won't miss the beef I promise. These burgers are moist, juicy and packed with flavor. I used the ground turkey that includes dark meat. In the past using the ground turkey breast has no been as successful.","These are actually good. Mind you, I can eat a hamburger every day and not tire of it (the main reason that I decided to try this). I did add a little liquid smoke & subbed onion powder for the onions. I ate this on a bun with honey mustard & lettuce, yum! Thanks Trudi!","If you are thinking about making these on the grill, DON'T!!! I grilled them and about half of them ""melted"" through the grates.","This recipe is fabulous! Only added about a tbsp of Worcestshire sauce. Also note, these burgers do not shrink like beef burgers do so make the patties the exact size that you want to eat them at.","Oh my goodness! This recipe is worth more than 5 stars! I made these burgers this evening...they were flavorful and moist! I did make some changes, I halved the recipe as the package of turkey was only a pound and a half. In addition, I used 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 c of chopped onion as I love those flavors. I used a handful of parsley which I did not measure and one whole egg. I also used panko breadcrumbs 6TBS. In stead of salt and pepper, I used Montreal Steak seasoning within the mix and sprinkled lightly on each side when I put them on my outdoor propane grill. Thank you for this fantastic Turkey Burger recipe! This one is truely a keeper!","I gave this 5 stars using this as a base for the recipe I ended up making. I basically used all the ingredients listed but had to adjust for 1 lb of turkey to make 4 burgers for 2 ppl. I sauteed my onion and garlic in a little Smart Balance spread first before adding to the meat and added about a tsp of rubbed sage also. Used Slap Ya Mama seasoning instead of salt and pepper (if you can't find that, Tony's would also work). Make sure to use a good bit of seasoning as turkey can be pretty tasteless otherwise. I used one whole egg as well. And added a little worchestershire sauce. Yea they're pretty darn soft and hard to handle at first, but if you get them formed and in the pan, fry on medium to med low heat and start flipping occasionally when they're firm enough to flip, two at a time depending on your pan size. They turned out so super juicy! Best turkey burgers I've made yet! Highly recommended :)",Cut back egg white to one and add grated granny smith apple. For moisture..No one will know it is in the burger. Great!!!,"These are fantastic! I scaled down the recipe and added a splash of worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and a healthy dose of steak seasoning. I also used oatmeal (pulverized in the food processor) in place of the bread crumbs. Will definitely make this one over and over and over again!","AWESOME: for serving of 8: I changed to 2 lbs ground turkey breast, 1/4 c italian bread crumbs, 1/4 c finely chopped onion & 1 clove garlic chopped as well, 1 egg, 2 T dried parsley, 1 t seasoned salt, 1/4 t pepper, 1 T bbq sauce, 5 splashs worch sauce, 1 splash soy sauce, mix together, add a little flour when shaping patties to form a nice crust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,"This is a very good recipe which I will definitely use again. After reading other reviews, I made a couple adjustments. I salted the grated zucchini first and let it sit in a colander to draw out the excess moisture. Then I patted it dry with paper towels. I also added some fresh chopped garlic and Italian-style bread crumbs to the mixture. Then, after forming the patties, I patted on more bread crumbs. They fried up nice and crispy. I served them with marinara sauce, which my husband and I both thought was the perfect accompaniment.","These are delicious! I substituted instant mashed potato flakes for the flour, which I think makes for better taste and consistency!","WOW! These are soooo good! Very easy to make. I tweaked the recipe a bit though since it seemed a little bland as is. I added some black pepper, parsley and garlic. I also threw in some chopped mushrooms since they go so well with zucchini. I think next time I'll try different cheeses and other complementary veggies like red bell pepper. These would probably go really well with some marinara sauce too.","These zucchini patties are AWESOME!! My husband and I both loved them--I can't wait to make them for others. I did tweak the recipe a bit and followed the suggestions of others. The liquid from the zucchini absolutely needs to be squeezed out to make this work--otherwise it will be much too runny. Here is what I did: used 3 eggs instead of 2 (i had a bit more onion and zucchini than what was called for), added 3 cloves of pressed garlic, a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, 3/4 to a full cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs, and 1/2 c. of cheddar (on top of the other cheeses). Also, I lessened the amount of flour to maybe 1/4 c. Lastly, I sprinkled the patties with bread crumbs before frying. Will definitely make this again--can't wait in fact!","These are great with the recipe as is, but they turn out a little better if you drain the excess water off of the Zuc first. I've also used just a Tablespoon of flour and a 1/3 cup of seasoned bread crumbs to replace the 1/2 cup flour, to add more flavor and they were fabulous.","I make these patties all the time. For a more healthy way I bake them in a jelly roll pan at 375 for 20 min then turn them and bake for an additional 15. Time depends on your oven, the size of the patties and thickness. I spray the bottom of the pan with PAM. I squeeze as much water out of the zucchini as possible and I don't use salt. The salt makes the zucchini more runny. There is enough salt in the cheeses and you can always salt them after they are baked. I also use 1/2 cup of pepper jack cheese and 1/2 cup of feta instead of the mozzarella cheese. These cheeses give the patties a better taste. I don't use any oil or flour in my patties. I use Italian bread crumbs I also double the recipe but don't double the eggs.","Hey, this is Sherlie! Thank you so much for all your kind reviews and thanks for trying my recipe. I am so thrilled that it is so popular and that Allrecipes has put it in several of their cookbooks. It is a versatile recipe and can be varied with any indgredients except of course the zucchini. One of the best tips for making it is to drain the zucchini as it makes the batter runny if you dont and doing that in a couple of paper towels works wonderfully. Just wring it out. Thanks again, readers. You are a great bunch!!!","Wow, what a great recipe for zucchini. We just ate these up. They even look just like potato patties. I made these even lighter by adding reduced fat shredded mozzarella cheese and frying them in a spray marjorine. I also added some garlic for extra flavor. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will surely use over and over again.","This recipe was simple and great tasting! What I also did was make the full recipe, made enough for my fiance and myself. Then I put the remining mixture back in the fridge to use again a few days later. It was fine, just drain the accumulated liquid from the settling.","These were very delicious, my husband was surprised at how much he liked them! I did as someone else suggested and drained off all the extra juice I could from the zucchini and then placed it in some paper towels and squeezed out all the juice that was left. It helped make these patties nice and crispy with a yummy cheesy inside!",This recipe was great. I ommited the mozzarella cheese because I didn't have any on hand but they were still great. My husband loved them and told me I might have to make these every night! My sister and her 1 1/2 year old son loved them too. I will definitely make these again.,"Wow, a versatile recipe for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike. I love them crispy and hot right out of the pan, and my husband prefers the flabby, soft, reheated leftovers. Here's a few tips: 1. Make sure you squeeze the excess liquid out of the grated zucchini. Salting it helps, then let it sit in a strainer for a while, then squeeze out the rest with paper towels. 2. I think they taste much better when you don't use plain flour. Bisquick, mashed potato flakes, and even whole wheat flour give a much better flavor. 3. Try adding a bit of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes... yum! 4. These are great for using up that last bit of whatever vegetable you have on hand. I've added some grated carrot, yellow squash, or chopped red pepper. There's a million ways to change it up; try one of your own, then share the results with the rest of us!","I used this recipe more as a baseline of how to make knock off's of Ruby Tuesday's zucchini mini's. I added roasted red peppers and feta. I also grilled mine on a George Forman Grill, so I didn't have to fry them. I was very pleased with the outcome. So if you want to cut some of the fat and calories, grilling these is an option. Thank you for the great recipe!","I thought these were good, although my children didn't care for the amount of red pepper. I'll try again and tweak the spices.",This is such a good recipe! I agree with another reviewer that it's hard to fry them fast enough! I make them every chance I get and they are a staple at my house! COOKS NOTE...Be sure to use a grater with BIG holes.. grating too fine will result in mush!,"4 stars as written, but it's a definite 5 star with a few changes. It's really important to squeeze as much excess liquid out of the shredded zucchini before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients - otherwise, these would be too mushy/wet. I used about a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/8 cup of flour. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and a small bunch of fresh basil to the mix. They are soooo freakin' good. Just like crab cakes, but without the expensive crab. We'll be making these a lot.","Fantastic! To puff up the zucchini a bit, I added some baking powder, just like in potato pancakes. I made these for my DH who is low-carbing it instead of making potato pancakes. You couldn't even tell the difference. They are fantastic - serve them with sour cream (my fav) or applesauce (an old German tradition with potato pancakes.) I shallow-fried these first then finished off in a 425 oven for about 10 minutes. Yummy!!!","i got my zucchini all prepped and realized i didn't have any onions left or flour!!!! WHAT??? i just left the onion out, and used potato flakes to replace the flour. these are soooo good. i couldn't stop eating them. they're real, hot, right out of the pan, but soooooo much better at room temp. gonna have to double the recipe next time. Thanks for sharing Sherlie :)","As I'm sure others either know or have learned, draining the zucchini really does ensure the success of this recipe. To give it a little kick beyond the fairly quiet taste of the mozzarella, I used Pepper Jack cheese and we both loved the little surprise of ""bite."" I loved these and even tho' I pretty much forced them on tonight's menu despite knowing Hub is not fond of them, I was quite pleased when he reported he liked them. I served these with the suggested little plop of sour cream and some fresh chives, but I think the tomato sauce idea sounds good and tempting too!","I added fresh garlic and basil and fried in butter. I don't know exactly what was wrong with it, but it just wasn't that good. It was ok at best. The bf liked it tho.","These were REALLY good! I guess I used the recipe as a ""base"" because I added 5 chopped baby port mushrooms, 1 chopped sweet red pepper, potato flakes, garlic, black pepper and paprika. I didn't drain the zucchini, or add salt until it was in the pan, I also omitted the flour. I switched out the mozz. for sharp white cheddar and added an egg. I let it sit for a minute or two while the pan heated up to allow the potato flakes to absorb some of the zucchini juice. These were so good. I served them with smashed (lightly seasoned) avocado.","taste wise it's probably more like 3 1/2, but it was easier than i thought it would be and I DON'T think the zucchini needed to be strained. i simply blotted my shredded zucchini with some paper towels and DIDN'T use bread crumbs. They fried up just like pancakes. (and i'm not an expert fryer) Bread crumbs might have bumped up the flavor though...","These are delicious. A great recipe that we will use often due to great zucchini success in the garden this year. After shredding, I put the zucchini in a colander and sprinkled a couple of teasp of kosher salt on top. Let this hang out in the sink for approx. 30 min to drain and then used clean kitchen towel and squeezed out the remaining moisture. I diced the onion very small to make sure it was tender in the short cook time and used 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs. Perfect. Grandbaby, young adults, teens, hubby, everyone loved them and insist that we at least double the recipe next time. Thanks for sharing!","I have been making these for years, and love them. I use asiago cheese instead of parmesan (more flavor) and add some garlic powder also. Soooo good!",I could go on and on about this recipe but I'll simply sum it up in one word: YUM.,"Very good except I baked them at 375 for 25 min intead of frying....also added some grilled onions I had on hand and onion and garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and I used sharp cheddar and monterey jack cheeses. Will make this again and often!!!","These were great! I used corn meal instead of flour and added bread crumbs, cheddar cheese and carrots. Rather than fry them, I sprayed with olive oil and broiled them for about 6 minutes each side. They heat up well!! I also ate them with applesauce spread on top.",,,,,,,,,
107,"This was the best turkey I have ever made or eaten. I could not believe how moist and tender the breast was! My thanksgiving was made perfect with this delicious bird. Everyone asked how I did it, even my elderly aunt, who is the best cook ever, raved about it. I used about a stick and a half of butter under the skin. I buttered that bird good. I also rubbed the outside of the bird with butter before pouring the boullion mixture and before the seasoned salt. It was such a beautiful golden brown. I was so busy that day that I only got it basted a couple of times during cooking, but it couldn't have been any better or jucier. This was a 21 pound bird, and I cooked it for 1 hour at 375 degrees then reduced to 350 degrees for 5 more hours to reach 180 degrees. Perfect!!! Thanks a million Robin!!","This is a wonderful recipe for beginners as well as the experienced cook. I put this bird in the oven, went to the movies, came back to a moist succulent turkey. It's that easy. I put butter under the skin of the legs too (in total I use 1 cube for the entire bird). I also add black pepper to the seasoning. Every bite is moist!! You can't go wrong!! Lots of wonderful pan juiced to make gravy with. Superfine flour called ""Wondera"" by Gold Medal is a must for new cooks. Your gravy will be lump free. Taste your gravy after you have thickened it to see if you need to add anymore salt and pepper. If too salty, just dilute with water and a little more flour...until it tastes good. Easy gravy!","We had an early Thanksgiving feast this year with family and at the last minute, my sister, who was supposed to bring the turkey, went to the hospital and I told her not to worry about a thing. I have never cooked a turkey before and had no idea what I was doing! I looked up ""turkey"" on this site and found this recipe. I read some reviews and decided this was it. I had a 23 pound turkey so I doubled the recipe and threw it in the roaster while it was still a bit frozen. This was at 9:00pm the night before the feast. Then I forgot about it, didn't even have time to baste it at all the next day. We didn't wind up eating until after 1:00. About 10 minutes before we ate, I took the tin foil off and prayed it was good. Not only was it good, it was juicy and fell off the bone!!! I think I should also say that when I read the recipe, I thought you had to cut the skin to get the butter on the meat itself, but my husband pointed out that the recipe did not say to ""cut"" the skin. He got under the skin and pulled it from the meat really easily and I think that's what you're supposed to do. I didn't know that, since this was my very first turkey. My family requested that I ""volunteer"" to do the turkey from now on. Thanks so much for posting this recipe! Now I know how to cook a moist, delicious turkey!","This recipe turned out great! I added 1 tsp. garlic powder to the water along with the bouillon, parsley and onion. Put fresh rosemary under the breast skin with the butter. Also placed a quartered lemon and quartered onion inside the cavity. Used a 12 lb. bird as recommended and it was done in 3 hours. Allowed it to rest 20 minutes before carving. Be sure to spray the foil with cookong spray.","I had never cooked a turkey before, and decided to try this recipe when I made Thanksgiving dinner for 28 people! EVERYONE loved it, and some even said it was the best they'd ever had! I've used it every year since. Using a cooking bag really helps to seal in the flavor, making the meat very moist. I also like to make a butter mixture with garlic salt, and use that to make the breast meat juicy and flavorful.",If you customize this recipe for a larger turkey....DO NOT INCREASE THE SALT TO THE RECOMMENDED PORTION. Season it as you would to your personal taste. I made this mistake and my gravy was sooooo salty. Big mistake!,"My Thanksgiving turkey was the BEST turkey I have ever tasted, and the family RAVED over it. Before you place the butter under the skin, do this... take an entire stick of butter (or more depending on the size of your bird) and place it in a food processor or blender. Blend in a handful of fresh rosemary, sage, and thyme. Spread this mixture beneath the skin of the ENTIRE turkey. If any butter is remaining, spread it over the top of the turkey. Be liberal in your buttering of the turkey... it's worth it, and it's the holidays!! DO NOT add the parsley to the mixture you pour over the turkey... it makes a clumpy, ugly mess. Otherwise, this recipe is fantastic. It will make the juiciest, tastiest turkey ever, and the gravy you will make with the drippings will be like nothing you have ever tasted. I also used the ""Out of This World Turkey Brine"" found on this site one day before roasting. Then I used the ""Cranberry, Sausage, and Apple Stuffing"". Amazing. I will cook every turkey this way from now on.",I cannot believe I forgot to rate this. I made this for Thanksgiving. My second time ever making turkey. THIS is BY FAR The BEST turkey I have ever had. All anyone could say is how great it was. It actually was not dry and had flavor. I put a little more butter than it called for under the skin and rubbed butter over the top. And basted as prescribed. AWESOME the ONLY turkey recipe we will ever use.,"I used this recipe to make my first turkey tonight and it turned out excellent. I used an 18lb butterball turkey with the oven at 350 degrees for about 5 hours. I also created an incredible gravy from the the drippings & liquid. Next time, I think will also use some garlic! I highly recommend this recipe.","I don't eat turkey, but coooked this for the big family Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved this, even my mainly vegetarian niece who tried a little bit. My sister said the meat was so tender it melted in her mouth and hubby was able to use the cooking liquid to make a killer gravy! Instead of dried minced onion, I threw in some freshly minced shallots and garlic then stuffed it with the Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry stuffing. What a perfect pair!","This is the best turkey I've ever tasted! I made it for company and everyone loved it!! I had a 12lb turkey and cooked it for exactly 3 1/2 hours. I lined the bottom of a roasting pan with foil, put turkey and broth, then covered the pan and turkey with a big paper bag. I took the bag off the last hour. The gravy I made with the broth was so good!! Everyone was snorting as they ate. I'll never use any other turkey recipe again!","OK, I know everyone's written about this recipe, but I just have to say that we NEVER eat turkey. I made this for Christmas last year (I was in a ""traditional"" mode) It literally fell off the bone. It was incredible. We devoured it. NOTHING LEFT. Since then, we've made it several times. Each time - amazing results. I have referred many people to this recipe. It's worth it's weight in gold!","Wow! This was the BEST turkey I've ever made! It was moist, tender and tasted great. After reading reviews, I used a whole cube of butter and put it under the skin all over (not just the breast). That definitely improved the tenderness of the drumsticks and wings. A few substitutions for what I had on hand: 3 chicken bouillon cubes instead of measuring out 3 Tbsp., minced fresh parsley and onion instead of dried, and lemon pepper instead of seasoning salt. Using an oven bag and basting every hour (thru the slits cut in the bag), it took 3-1/2 hours to cook a 23 lb. turkey. On turkey #1, the bag stuck to the breast skin in some places. On turkey #2, I oiled the inside of the bag above the breast which reduced the sticking skin and made the breast look much nicer. To make the gravy, I removed the pan juices and heated about 2 Tbsp of the separated fat (top layer) with 2 Tbsp of flour over medium heat until it bubbled (like making white sauce). Then I whisked in about 2 cups of the pan juice (bottom layer). The gravy was fantastic! Thanks to Robin for posting this wonderful recipe and thanks also to everyone who posted their helpful reviews!","I first reviewed this on Nov. 20 but after reprinting it since I lost mine went through the reviews again and decided to update since I seen some had some issues with it being dry and not browning. I used a 23 pound turkey and replaced the water with chicken broth. I used the same amount of butter for the pockets, rubbed it with olive oil and I took the foil off the last hour so it could brown. I also let the turkey rest covered with foil for 30 minutes before carving so the juices would flow back throughout the turkey. After transferring the carved pieces to the platter there was still juices left on the platter after the turkey was all gone. That's how juicy the turkey turned out to be. Nov. 20th review: This makes the best turkey, moist, tender, delish. I found this recipe last Thanksgiving and use it to cook turkey year round. I do add quite a bit more chicken stock (personal preference) and make gravy with the drippings. Yummy","Wow, easy and great! And moist! Last year I made ""Perfect Turkey"" from this site, which required both brining and turning over during cooking. Don't bother with either! Make this much-easier and just-as-good turkey instead! The only changes I made were to put the turkey on a bed of onion, celery & carrot chunks, and to stuff a few pieces of the above plus a chopped apple into the cavity. None of these veggies are eaten, but they give the turkey and juices a great flavor. Don't use the cooking times in the recipe as my 20-lb bird took only 4 hours. (Also note that in ingredient list, ""broth"" is supposed to read ""bouillon."")",The turkey in this recipe definitely comes out moist with good flavour. However I like a nice rich gravy and all the chicken stock watered it down too much. I had to doctor the gravy with seasonings and browning sauce. Next time I might try less stock and add it a little at a time to allow the juice in the bottom of the pan time to brown.,"Well, this is a very easy to fix turley recipe and definietly one to try again. However, the time alotted for cooking is definitely way off - I had a 14 1/2 pounder that cooked much, much faster than I expected - my bird was 2 1/2 pounds larger than the recipe called for and was done before 3 1/2 hours were up. I wish I had checked the bird earlier - I never dreamed it would be ready so quickly. This was the first year I had to rush around to get the fixings done on time while the turkey waited. Usually, I'm still waiting for the turkey and my fixings are all sitting on the table! I'd recommend checking your bird after 2 hours and every 1/2 after that until it is done.","Great recipe, thanks! This was the most tender and moist turkey we have had. Be careful not to let it overcook though, it cooks fast! My 12lb, unstuffed turkey was done in about 2-1/2 hours. As a personal preference...I'd rather do the browning at the beginning of the cooking time, then cover for the rest of the cooking time. So that the turkey can be taken out as soon as it's done, instead of taking a chance on it drying out while you're waiting for it to brown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

109,"YUMMY!!! This recipe was great. I made some modifications based on the ingredients I happened to have on hand, and it still turned out great. Used 1.5 lbs ground beef (since it was packaged that way), 1.5 cups salsa since that was all I had, black beans instead of chili beans for a little added mexican flare, 2 cups crused tortillas, no olives (can't stand em), and 1 can diced tomatoes, drained. GREAT TURN OUT!!! A few things, though... I agree with another reviewer that 3 cups is definitely too much for the tortilla chips. The 2 cups I used was too much. I'll only use about 1.5 cups next time. Also, my diced tomatoes were canned with basil and garlic, and I didn't care much for the flavor with this casserole (although it was mild enough that I still gobbled it up), so I'll remember to have just some regular diced tomatoes on hand from now on. And, if you like green onion, don't skimp on it here. The flavor really goes well in this dish; I mean, out of this world. MMMMM... Of course, as others suggested, I browned the ground beef with onion and taco seasoning (I added this WHILE the meat browned, not after, but either way would probably work fine). As always, I used all organic ingredients and followed the layering just as specified in the recipe. This dish is a knockout! Thanks so much for sharing it.","We thought this recipe was awesome! I did do as many others and added a packet of taco seasoning to the meat. I also added a little garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne-southern people love there seasonings!! I used bite-size totrilla chips and they worked out prefectly. This recipe is definitely going to be a repeat!","I changed this up a bit to try to make it healthier. I used corn tortillas on the bottom instead of torilla chips, and layered the ingredients in 2 layers, like a lasanga, hoping it would hold together better. I used one layer of corn and another of flour torillas. I used a blend of cheese (""mexican style"") and low fat sour cream, added an additional can of chili beans, and used ground turkey instead of beef. I also added a green pepper, an onion and green chilis and some more spices, as many reviewers said it was bland. It wasn't spicy at all so next time I'll add more to it. It still was pretty tasty and a hearty meal with a nice salad.","This was fantastic. I normally would have used refried beans with a dish like this, but the chili beans were perfect! They added just the right flavor to it. Our whole family loved this recipe. We will definitely be eating it again. I don't think I will crush the chips next time though. Instead I'm going to try leaving the chips whole. Some of the chips were a little tender, and we all prefer crispy things to stay crispy. We still loved it though just as it is.","WOW! I doubled the recipe so I could experiment and the results were incredible! Changes from original recipe include: 1. Used 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 sweet saugage, casing removed. 2. Used chipotle taco seasoning. 3. Used chili and black beans. 4. Used 1 can of diced tomatoes, salt free, and 1 can of Rotel. 5. Mixed cheddar with salsa jack cheese. 6. Added garlic and onion powder. 7. Forgot the black olives. This meal was so delicious. As others have mentioned, not the healthiest option, but for a pot luck or get together where it will be one of many choices, it can't be beat!","This was mui bueno! I added green chilies, seasoned (drained) black beans, taco seasoning, Emeril's Southwest Essence, (drained) Mexicorn and a can of Rotel. Did not use the sour cream but I did layer the ingredients using split white corn taco shells. Seemed a bit soggy so next time I'll double the thickness of the taco shells. Nice paired with a salad tossed with southwestern ranch dressing. A good recipe to customize to your own taste. I just love these recipes where canned products end up being used so creatively you can't tell they're canned.","This was excellent. I did change a couple of things. Added garlic, used black beans instead of chili beans, added corn and chopped canned chilies. I also mixed monterrey jack in with the cheddar. The salsa I used was Joe T. Garcia's, medium. My fiance loved this recipe and gave me the line, ""It's a keeper!"" The wonderful thing about this recipe is you can add anything. Want it hot, add hot salsa.","Not only is this an easy dish, it is also VERY good. Per other reviews, I used taco seasoning on the meat after it was browned. I also reduced the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups and spread it thin over the meat (my boyfriend is not the biggest sour cream fan) and sprinkled appx 1 cup crushed chese flavored nacho chips (ie: doritos) before topping it all off with cheese. Very tasty! We have no leftovers! Thanks Andrea!","Easy and something different for a mexican meal. I did as others and used taco seasoning and black beans with the ground beef. In addition, I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies and Mexicorn on top of the sour cream.","I can't actually speak first hand on this recipe because I changed it so much but we like it enough that I wanted to share what I did because this recipe has endless opportunities for growth! I actually did a combo of this recipe and the ""Mexican Casserole"" recipe on this site with a bit of my own tastes as well. 1st I used 1lb. of hamburger and 1lb. of ground turkey browned with garlic and onion and put in taco seasoning and chili powder. then, I added a can of Rotel tomatoes, ranch beans and a few spoonfulls of cream cheese. in the pan, I put down a layer of flour tortillas, a layer of the meat mixture, sour cream on top of that, with lots of shredded sharp cheddar and colby jack and repeated. Ended with a layer of cheese on top and baked to a beautiful golden brown. All I can see is YUMMO as did my 8 yr old son and Husband. I made homemade guacamole and served with chips so you can either it plain of dip your chips in the casserole. I didn't want the chips to get soggy as others mentioned. This will be made a lot in my home from now on and I hope you will experiment with your favorite flavors! OOPS, P.S. I also added two cans of cream of mushroom soup into the mixture.","This is an excellent recipe. I have been making it for years. When I explained my version to my family in Mexico, they said: here we call it ""Pastel Azteca"". In my version I use chopped white or red onions instead of green. I sautée the meat with one of each of diced red and green (sweet)peppers and taco spice mix, also I usually use a mixture of grated cheeses: mozarella and cheddar. A hint: if you use whole fresh corn tortillas and layer them with the other ingredients, it turns out like a lasagna! Sometimes instead of adding the beans to the casserole I make frijoles refritos and serve them as a side dish. Along with a green salad. And a bowl of extra salsa picante.","I have been making this for about 8 or 9 years. I have tried other Mexican/Taco casseroles, but this is always the one that I come back to. My family, and everyone I have made it for love it. I have changed a few things for our taste, but the basic recipe is the original. I use a little less crushed chips. I saute a couple of chopped jalapenos and 1/2 red onion in a little cooking oil before I brown the ground beef. I use hot salsa. I use a can of dark red kidney beans and a can of black beans. I use the blend of Kraft shredded Mexican cheese. I put the black olives in with the beans. Serve sour cream, guacamole, sliced green onions, chopped jalapenos, and chopped tomatoes as garnish for the dish so everyone can add to their liking. I think by cooking the beef/salsa mixture until the liquids from the salsa evaporate will cure the problem some have with the soggy chips. I also drain and rinse the beans. I have never had a problem with soggy chips. I use a 9x13 glass pyrex pan and put it on a rimmed cookie sheet for baking. This is a recipe that very easily adapts to personal tastes. Thank you the many good meals and compliments I have received from serving this dish.","Our family loved this recipe! I made just a few changes to it. 1) Used lean ground turkey and drained it after browning, 2)Along with the chunky salsa, I added a packet of taco seasoning which gave it extra flavor and kick 3)used black beans because I didn't have chili beans 4)I spread 1 1/2 (not 3) cups of ""broken"" (not ""crushed"") tortilla chips in the bottom of the pan 5)Sprinkled 1 cup of shredded cheddar over top of the broken tortilla chips and topped that with the meat mixture 4)Spread just 1 cup of sour cream over the meat mixture 5)Substituted a can of drained diced tomatoes for the fresh ones 6)Topped the casserole with more broken tortilla chips, and topped that with the remaining 1 cup of shredded cheddar. I served it with extra sour cream and guacamole. FANTASTIC! My family wants this in our regular supper rotation. : ) A great recipe to ""play"" around with. Thanks for posting, Andrealf63","Good & quick recipe. Sheesh...perhaps it could be called Tex Mex Casserole to accomodate both regions. This would satisfy the critic who rated it 1 star because Mexicans don't iuse sour cream, cheese,. chili beans, etc. Get a LIFE!",This is excellent! I cooked it as written and served it to a group of teenagers. Everyone liked it.,"This is a perfect recipe to make use of those tortilla chips left in the bottom of the bag! With the seasoning, it's also a great recipe for our family to use natural venison meat. You can cook it as is, leave ingredients out when you're short or jazz it up by cooking a couple cloves of minced garlic with the meat mixture and/or adding taco seasoning. When I've been out of salsa, I've also swapped it with a canned Mexican mix of diced tomoatoes and jalapenos with good results. I prefer using a Mexican mix of cheese instead of the cheddar. My husband prefers the layering in the following order to keep the chips crisp: meat mixture, sour cream, veggie layers, crushed chips, and cheese.","This is so... for my family, we loved it! Like many others I did make a few changes. In lieu of chips I lined a 9 x 13 dish with 2 layers of corn tortillas,. I heated/browned them over a gas flame, used a dozen. As others I added a can of drained corn. I also added a package of Taco Seasoning to the ground beef. Drained off the excess fat, added the drained beans and corn and salsa. After layering the beef mixture over the corn tortillas, I spread the sour cream and sprinkled the shredded cheese ( I used a combine mixture of sharp chedder and Jack). I than added the chopped tomates, chopped green onions and sliced black olives, I thought the presentation would be better, then just a layer of cheese. I was right! This was so great because I normally have everthing in the house. This will also be good for a large group, I know I will be making it for a church potluck!","Had the students in my survival cooking class make this recipe. Most of them enjoyed it. I thought the tortilla chips, which lined the bottom, tasted too dry. Would probably add more ground beef also.","Even Emily liked this!! I added taco seasoning to the meat while I browned it. I also used diced tomatoes in a can and not fresh, but it will be much better with fresh tomatoes chopped as called for.","I make this every few months with a couple of tweaks,2 lbs lean ground beef, I use black beans{drained and rinsed} in the meat mixture along with a touch of hot salsa,can of chopped green chilis{undrained},some chili powder and a packet of taco seasoning{starts with ""O"",middle name""EL"" last name ""P""} yellow packet with red letters original} to give it a kick. Also I make a big 9x13 pan size with double layers so I spray the pan, spread out crushed corn tortilla chips, warmed up{makes easier to spread}refried beans, the meat mixture, the sour cream and toppings, Mexican shredded cheese, then repeat the layers with corn chips and ending with the cheese{we omit the olives}. So I just double the amount of ingredients to make the double layers My family loves this recipe and we are so grateful you shared it.","This was delicious and so easy! You can add so much to it and make it even better but it's just a great meal for the family. I used other reviewers suggestions and did the taco seasoning and added green chilis and wow, it just made it have so much more zing to it. Highly recommend this recipe!","i love this...i just use black beans instead of chili beans, and sometimes add corn.","This was very tasty. I want to make one comment about some of the other reviews. Many complained that the tortillas were soft after baking. This is a casserole. If you want crunchy chips, make nachos. I used a double layer of whole chips (the dense Mexican style kind), and added the toppings as indicated in the recipe, after cooking the beef with onions and fajita seasoning. The chips actually resembled a soft corn tortilla after cooking. Thanks for the recipe!",I followed others advice and changed a few things and it was great. Black beans instead of chili..used bite size chips without crushing..didn't cook the sour cream but layered it ontop after cooking and cooling then sprinkled more cheese on top of that..used 3/4 cup fresh tomato instead of 1/2...added taco seasoning/water to meat mixture along with salsa and can of rotel with green chili peppers when simmering ...and lastly used shredded mexican cheese (mixed bag from walmart)....I cooked for 30min like recipe said but believe next time I would cook only 15-20..,"This is FANTASTIC!!! Honestly, when I saw the great reviews I thought, ""Really? It looks to simple to be that delicious!"" but my gosh is it!!! Yum! I left out the olives completely just because I don't like them and added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to the meat as it was browning. I only used 2 cups of crushed tortilla chips and that was plenty. Use the chili beans; no, it doesn't seem 'Mexican-y' but it adds a great flavor. I doubled the green onion because I love it and it really tastes so good in this dish. I used a mix of cheddar and taco blend cheese on top. The only change I will be making for next time is to leave out the sour cream. When it baked it got an almost dry, 'curdled' like texture that I wasn't a fan of. I will just serve it at the table to dollop on top as I love dour cream and like the way the coolness of it offsets spicier Mexican dishes, but this us just my preference. What a great, easy casserole...Thanks so much for it!!! :)","I love this! Added 1T of taco seasoning as others did, also added a can of Rotel with salsa and simmered long enough to thicken up before baking. Omitted olives. Was going to freeze some, but too good-never made it to freezer. Good leftovers to take to work. Definitely in my top 5 on this site. Thank u!",,,,,,,,,,

111,"I first grabbed this recipe in 2003 and have been making it ever since. I have made a few alterations/shortcuts I thought others might like to know. 1) I throw the chops in a marinade overnight of 2x apple juice to soy. The sweet and salt help make the chops even juicer. 2) I always make at least double if not 4 times the sauce or there is arguing... :) so when time is short or I just don't feel like peeling all those apples, I buy 2 cans of the higher priced pie filling and put that in the frying pan used for browning with a stick of butter.(scrape up the good bits.) It usually has the right amount of spices built right in so I just heat through. Arrange over top the chops in a baking pan. Bake covered in foil at 350 for 20-25 minutes. Remove foil - sprinkle with brown sugar and chopped pecans - bake 15 mins more for carmelize and crunch. DELICIOUS! Pairs great with butternut squash or sweet potatoes and corn or green beans. Homemade honey wheat bread is sure to disappear. I pour all pan juices over the servings for mopping. Every year when the weather turns cold here, the family starts asking ""Is it time for apple pork chops??"" :)","I was nervous after reading some of the reviews, whether or not to bake the chops in the oven or cook them in a pan as the recipe states. After talking to my butcher, I decided to bake them. I first tripled the sauce, and left it to simmer on the stove, covered, for about 30 minutes...I also added about 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it. I then poured the sauce over the pork chops in a covered casserole dish and baked it all at 350 degrees for about 30-45 min. It came out wonderful! It was so tender; everyone loved it!","This is one of my husband's & kids' favourites. I broil the chops in the oven instead (usually 5-6 minutes per side) and cook up the apples on the stovetop so that everything is ready at the same time. Granny Smiths seem to work best. I don't use the oil, salt, pepper, or pecans. I just throw the sauce ingredients into the pan instead of premixing them in a bowl and slice the apples right into the pan. I don't waste time coring them. I just take thin slices off all around the sides till I get to the core. I let it all thicken together instead of separating the apples from the sauce. Less steps& less dirty dishes with these shortcuts! We have it with steamed rice. Quick & Easy.","This was the tastiest and an easy way to make pork chops! I made some changes after reading some of the reviews. I sauteed a sliced onion in the butter, then added the sauce ingredients (doubled) & the apple. I added salt, pepper and garlic to the raw chops, placed them in a 9x13 pan, topped them with the sauce, and baked at 350 for an hour. I made 2 batches of this since we were having dinner guests...they cancelled, so 8 pork chops disappeared amongst 3 of us! Hey, 1 is a teenage boy that usually won't eat pork chops. That's how good they are! :)","Per previous reviews, I doubled the sauce but not the apples. I also followed another recommendation and put the cooked pork chops in a 13x9 pan and then poured the sauce and apples over top and baked them for 1/2 hr. This allowed me time to make the side dishes and have everything ready at the same time for dinner.","FABULOUS! Of course with the alterations I made I might as well submit a new recipe, but here is what I did. Forget the whole ""oven thing"" and use 2 skillets, one for the chops and one for the apples. For the chops, I marinated them in salt, pepper, 1 TBL minced garlic and about 1/4 c. sauterne (white) cooking wine for only about 15 minutes. I then sauteed them while making the sauce. For the sauce, I sauteed 2 small onions in butter until carmelized. Then added the other sauce ingredients -doubled (except apples). I just cooked that till tender and thought it needed some more ""juice"" so I added about 1/4 c. of apple cider, then a pinch of cornstarch to thicken. Served chops over brown rice and sauce over chops, died and went to heaven. Also, picky boyfriend loved it ;-)",Just okay. Not crazy about apples and pork but definitely had to try it as it looked interesting.,"These were fabulous. My husband said they have usurped his old favorite for the best pork chops dish EVER! I made 6 chops but made enough sauce for 20. I sprinkled the chops w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning & sauteed them in butter & olive oil. Then I pretty much followed LadyJayPee's lead & sauteed an onion in the butter first, addng the apples ( I used 4 granny smiths) but only cooking them for a couple of minutes. I also added a couple of tbp. of apple cider vinegar to add a little more depth to the sauce. Then I poured everything over the chops, covered them & baked @ 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Removed the foil & baked for another 10. Remembered just now, that I never added the pecans to the dish so if you don't have any...never fear, this dish is great w/out them. Srved them, as suggested by the submitter, w/ smashed potatoes & green beans w/ Raspberry White Chocolate Mousse in chocolate cups for dessert. Thansk for a wonderful recipe Karena...will have again many times!","My husband said “This is worth 10 stars and how many times have you heard me say that?” The answer is Never. My picky 16 y.o. took one bite and said “This is the best thing I have ever eaten.” Her friend said she didn’t like pork but would eat the rest of my meal. I told her she had to have one bite. She ended up eating a whole chop and said “My mom’s pork chops never taste like this.” I did Brine my chops for 12 hours in 1qt apple juice, ¼ cup kosher salt, and ¼ cup brown sugar. I *always* do this - it truly makes all the difference if you want moist chops. Followed other reviewers - tripled the sauce and added a shot of Bourbon (YumO!!!). I used an apple slicer (8 pieces per apple) and I used 4 apples for 4 1 1/2 thick chops. I browned the seasoned chops on both sides, placed them in a casserole dish, poured the apple/sauce mixture on top and baked them at 425 for 20 minutes (internal temp 160). I served these with a brown rice pilaf and roasted broccoli.","I really liked these. My 17 month old was in a mood to not eat anything. My husband liked the pork and sauce, but wouldn't try the apples. I thought the apples were the best part. The nice thing about this recipe is it looked so fancy, but was super easy to make.","I made two pork chops for two of us. I sprinkled garlic powder & black pepper on the chops & sauteed them in olive oil, on medium-high heat, browning them for 5 minutes on each side, then placed them in a small baking dish. In a separate skillet, I sauteed a medium chopped onion in (salted) butter. After it was tender, I added a bit more butter to the skillet because the onion had absorbed most of it; added the brown sugar mixture (even with only 2 chops, I doubled the amount of the brown sugar mixture), and one thinly sliced Granny Smith apple; simmered that until apple was fairly tender (maybe 20 mins), adding a small smattering of kosher salt to the apple mix. Poured ALL of this over the chops in the baking dish, covered with foil and baked at 350F for 50 minutes; then removed foil and baked for another 10 minutes. Topped with toasted pecan bits. The meat fell off the bone, the flavor combo of the onion/apple was wonderful, and the crunchy texture of the toasted pecans was great. Would definitely make this again.",Just made this tonight. It was wonderful! The only change I made was to saute onions first and I doubled the apple brown sugar sauce. I also salted and peppered the pork before I cooked it. My 9 year old son gave it a 9.9 out of 10.,"These were delicious! I've been wanting to make this forever. I did have to make a couple of changes because I put the chops in my slow cooker. I only browned them in butter...did not fully cook, I used boneless ribeye chops 3/4 in thick. I had a family pack (9)of them, so I scaled the sauce to 12.....I sliced about 6 apples but did not cook them in the sauce (didn't want to end up w/ apple mush). I put the browned chops (seasoned well)in the crockpot, put the raw apple slices on top, and poured the caramel sauce over all. Cooked on low for 4 hours, removed the apples and chops and thickened the sauce in the crockpot (High 10 min) with a cornstarch/apple juice slurry. The sauce/gravy was wonderful! Hubby even put it on his potatoes as well as chops and apples! The apples reminded us of the fried apples at Cracker Barrel. These were the most flavorful and moist pork chops I've ever fixed!! My family was less than thrilled when I told them what was for supper, but they truly loved it and they ate so much, they didn't even leave room for cobbler for dessert :) I served these w/ cheddar mashed potatoes and buttered green beans. YUM!! Will definately make again and again. Thank you Karena!",Great recipe! My husband ate these up...will definately make again.,"Oh wow! Loved this. Really good comfort food – makes me think of cold winter days in front of a cozy fire. I did tweak the recipe a bit after reading the advice of some of the others. First I cut the cooking time and eliminated the oven, I just cooked it in two pans on the stove simultaneously. I marinated the pork chops over night in a 2x apple juice to 1x soy sauce mixture. Just before putting them in the pan I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder to taste. With the apples, I doubled the sauce but found that two apples were plenty; I also doubled the cinnamon and added ground cloves and ground ginger. If you have finicky eaters, make sure and slice thick slices or pieces as the first time I made this the thin slices cooked enough to look like onions and I could NOT get some people to even taste them.","I'm not one for pork, but my husband is and he liked this one. I read through the reviews before making it and did two very thick chops with about triple the sauce. After browning them I put them in a baking dish, finished the sauce and baked them at 350 for about 35 minutes. The sauce was pretty easy to thicken just by adding a little more brown sugar and some cornstarch. I added some apple cider to the chops while they were browning and to the overall sauce. Next time I think I will take the advice of others and marinate the pork first. It had a nice flavor and you could cut it with a fork.","While pork and apples are a great combination; apples and caramel are even better in a sauce. I used boneless pork chops plus two large Granny Apples. I followed the recipe except I doubled the sauce and added about 1T of cornstarch to thicken it. I changed the cooking method a bit. I browned the pork chops in a skillet and then coated a baking pan with aluminum foil before putting in the pork chops. To the same pan I cooked the brown sugar mixture and apples down adding the 1T cornstarch. I layered the apples on top of the chops then I poured the remainder of sauce over the pork chops. I baked the chops covered in foil at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, then uncovered it and baked another 30 minutes. I spooned the sauce over apples and chops then sprinkled with the pecans and serve. The whole thing turned out melt-in-your-mouth goodness! The apples gave subtle sweetness without overpowering the pork chops and they were so tender and succulent. The sauce and apples are warm, lightly spiced and carmelized just right! The pecans added a nice crunch and it was the perfect touch to the dish. The meat was tender, flavorful and mouth-watering. I paired this with, “Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Onions, “ and “Green Beans with Walnuts,” also from this website.","I quickly felt full eating this. Next time, I will slice the apples thinner. I didn't get enough sauce and will double the amount next time. I cooked the apples first, then the chops.","This is the second time I made it, and this time I took the recommendations of others and baked it (instead of pan frying)....sssooooo much easier! I added half a sliced onion and sauted it in the pan with the butter. Then I added the brown sugar mixture (tripled the amount) and then added the apples. I let that saute a few minutes while placing the pork chops in a baking dish. Then I put the whole mixture on top, covered it with foil and baked for 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven. I give it 4 1/2 stars.","Great flavor. I sauteed a chopped shallot in oil, then browned the chops in the pan. I removed them to a plate, and added the butter to melt, then stirred in the b.sugar, cinn, and nutmeg. Added apples back to the pan, coated them well, and then put the chops back into the pan, covering them with the apple sauce. I covered the skillet, and baked @325 for 45 min. PERFECT. The only thing I will do next time is to remove the chops just before serving, and pour the gravy into a oil-separator. Then add back to the pan, and thicken it up a bit. THEN...wow...hard to beat! My family loved it!","Love this recipe! First of all I always triple or quadruple the sauce. My family loves the sauce. Secondly I usually make these in the oven. I make the sauce cover the chops with sauce and bake covered for about 30 minutes, then uncover and top with additional brown sugar and cook for about 15-20 more minutes. I also season the chops well before topping with sauce. Very tasty and easy recipe. I usually serve with rice and a veggie. Yummy!!","Delicious. I did as others suggested and marinated in salt, pepper, minced garlic, apple juice and a teensy bit of EVOO over night. To make it easier I broiled my chops for about 6 mins on each side--nothing worse than a grey chop! I sauteed onions in butter for about 5 mins before adding the brown sugar mix/apple mix and then continued to cook them through in the sauce. I probably quadrupled the sauce because we LOVE sauce. Finally, I cut my chops in to strips and threw in the skillet to soak up some sauce. This made it more like an apple pork stir fry and it WAS fabulous. The whole dinner took less than 30 mins to make. Yum!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,"Love it, love it love it. Seasoned italian bread crumbs are wonderful, I just added 1 tsp each of garlic powder and italian seasoning. I browned them olive oil 2 minutes on each side, then placed them on a roasting rack in the oven to finish. It was much less greasy and the rack allowed both sides to remain crispy.","EXCELLENT!! I've never been able to make good pork chops, but now I have a great recipe to fall back on. I followed some of the other suggestions about cutting back on the bread crumbs/egg mixtures and also dredged the chops in flour mixed with salt and pepper before dunking in eggs and bread crumbs. Also, if you do not know if your skillet is ovenproof, you can double wrap the handle in aluminum foil in order to make it ovenproof.","As suggested by others, I dredged the pork chops in flour before dunking them in the egg mixture, which I cut to just 1 egg and a couple tablespoons of milk. Also, I put the bread crumbs and cheese in a zip top baggie and then did a shake 'n bake type thing. I find it coats the chops better. My husband and I both fully enjoyed these pork chops. They were very easy to make and very moist.","I've always made my pork chops this way-lots of flavor and very tender. However, if you have left-over egg mixture...add the left-over bread crumb mixture to it and cook it in the frying pan after the chops are done. When mixing the two together, you need a slightly pourable consistency, so adjust accordingly, more milk or more bread crumbs as needed. Once it's in the pan, just spread it out a bit with your spatula. Let it cook for a few minutes and then, using your spatula, cut it into 'pie wedges' and flip over and finish cooking till it's lightly browned. Serve it on the platter with your chops. My mom and her mom before her never wasted anything. My 6 brothers and sisters and I grew up loving it, as did my 4 children and their friends. Just a nice little side dish, especially if you don't have a lot of meat to go around. Mom just called it 'egg and cracker'. (...and yes, I'm sure it's probably not the healthiest side dish, just thought I'd offer it up as an alternative to dumping it all down the sink)","I used 1 inch thick pork chops and increased the oven temp to 375. I bypassed the skillet altogether, and baked the chops on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes. Perfect every time. I use this same method for oven fried chicken. No oil required and use Egg Beaters instead of eggs. I also dredged the chops in flour then egg then breadcrumbs. I also added fresh parsley instead of green dried confetti. You can also substitute Italian breadcrumbs for panko and it makes for extra crispy crust.","I never breaded my pork chops before but since husband came along, he loves them that way so this was my attempt. These came out just as advertised but I should have read more of the reviews and went with 1 less egg and half of the bread crumbs (although it did make it quick and easy to bread with all of those crumbs!) I did transfer to a glass casserole for baking and easy table presentation. Might add ground rosemary next time. The 2 T. olive oil probably could have been 3-4 T. They did come out looking picture perfect though and hub must've complimented them more than anything else I've made (and I cook a lot). Thanks for the really easy recipe to get all that praise for!","Terriffic recipe! My husband loved it too, and he's a picky eater. However, I substituted SLICED garlic for the chopped, because it's easier to remove from the oil, rather than trying to retrieve a bunch of little garlic pieces from hot oil! Also, I added a teaspoon of italian seasoning blend to the milk/egg mixture. I will DEFINATELY use this recipe on a regular basis! THANK YOU!","These are the best! I add a little garlic powder to my italian bread crumbs and double dip my pork chops for a thicker coating. I don't have an oven proof skillet, so I just transfer the pork chops to a baking dish.","DELICIOUS!!! I loved them. I thought they were absolutely wonderful. What a nice change. BUT...the next time I make them, which will be soon, I will make a few more adjustments, because, per other reviews, I used (1) less egg, but it was still too much. I used (1/2) cup less bread crumbs, but that was still too much. I doubled the olive oil to (4) tablespoons, used crushed garlic, which I left in the pan when I added the pork chops. When done, they were a little greasy, however, I let them sit on paper towels before serving. Yum Yum.","At a total loss for what to do with the porkchops I had taken out of the freezer, I found this recipe. I had everything in the house and threw it together in no time, and to boot, it was very tasty! I would definitly do it again. I agree with another review, however, that the egg mixture was way too much. I could have made half the amount and it would have been plenty.","This was really good, of course I seasoned the pork chops before breading, and they came out sooo delicious. Thanks for the recipe!","Excellent, quick and easy recipe. Pork chops are moist and tender inside while crisp and crunchy outside. I make them slightly differently to keep the breading on the pork chops and nicely browned. 1.) Use Nature seasoning salt on the chops, for flavor, 2.) key to keeping breading on the chops, dredge in flour, light coat, dunk in egg wash, coat with breadcrumbs, let coating setup for 15 minutes before frying 3.) follow the rest of the recipe until cooking. 4.) Brown outside in oil covered fry pan med-high to medium, sizzling but not splashing, it takes about 1 minute per side lifting the chop with tongs occasionally to let oil under the chop. 4.) After browning set chops onto nonstick baking sheet then put into oven at 375F convection bake mode for 15 minutes turning chops over, halfway. 5.) Let rest on platter, uncovered for 5 minutes. They always come out perfect, I should take pictures sometime. Family loves this recipe.","I'm the author of this recipe and I just love that it has been enjoyed by so many of you out there! As I look at the recipe (after submitting it so many years ago) I see that there is room for improvement as many of you have noticed. My family rarely measured anything when they cooked, so I guesstimated when I originally wrote this recipe. Using only ONE egg, ONE tablespoon of milk, and equal amounts of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese-about 2/3 cup each, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried parsley would be great for starters. Also, I realize now that I was trying my best to get the most flavor from the garlic by chopping it, but I was always taught to smash the garlic clove to get the skin off. If you're smashing the garlic (carefully with the bottom of a glass or by using a chef's knife laid flat on the clove), that should open up the clove enough to allow the skin to easily come off and open the clove so the oils will infuse the olive oil. Lastly, quality makes a HUGE difference in any recipe you make. Powdered cheese vs. freshly grated parmesan, fresh vs. powdered garlic -need I say more? The thickness of your chops needs to be considered as well when you're cooking. If they are thin cutlets, you may not need to put them in the oven at all. I always use a meat thermometer (the kind that has a probe with a cord and digital screen) so there is no guessing when your meat is done. This recipe is delicious because it is so simple-keep it that way.","I am so happy to see that this recipe was submitted! I too, am from a Sicilian family and these pork chops were a staple in our family and now in mine. The only change that we make is to add about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder to the bread crumbs and my Nana always browned them in vegetable oil. I use half olive oil and half vegetable oil, just to get the pan hot enough to brown the chops evenly. My addition over the years is to place the browned chops onto cookie cooling racks sprayed with non-stick spray, and then arranged on a cookie sheet. It keeps the chops crispy. I allow them to sit a few minutes before serving, and the breading crisps up even more. Over the years, for my husband's family, I've made an American version. I substitute plain bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper; in place of the milk, I beat the eggs with a few tablespoons of creamy Ranch Dressing, and then follow the rest of the recipe. Thank you so much ELISAW, for a nice walk down memory lane!","Fantastic recipe. Just the same a my late(wonderful) Mother-in Law made them. She, too was Sicilian. These are wonderful when served with home-made (a New England thing) applesauce.","I try not to indulge in ""fried"" foods often, but am so glad I tried this as it had intrigued me for quite some time. Followed the recipe exactly (why wouldn't you, when rating it?) and it was delightful. 5 stars for a recipe that has joined my list of favorites! Thank you Elisaw for the posting!",This recipe was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to leave the garlic in the saucepan while I browned the pork chops instead of reserving it for another use. I found the flavor of the garlic encrusted on the pork chops absolutely mouth-watering as did the rest of my company. Thanks for sharing such a great and easy recipe with us! Looking forward to making this recipe again as it has now become a regular request at our house.,"YUM. These turned out really well. I really enjoyed the flavor. However, I will say that I did not even put them in the skillet, I just threw them in a baking dish and cooked them that way. I was in a rush and I dont like too many cooking steps. It turned out very nice just baking.",Great pork chops! I used thin boneless pork chops and followed the recipe as written except for changing the cook time. After browing for about 3 minutes on each side I put them in the oven for about 5-6 minutes and they were perfect. These were a hit with the entire family! I served them with a quick risotto and green peas.,"had no problem with just using egg (no milk) and estimated the bread crumbs. I didn't need to cook them in the oven, I thought the key to these were to NOT turn them often in the pan, just once per side. VERY YUMMY","These were so good I thought my heart was going to stop. I did cut back on the bread crumbs to 1C. and 1/4C. on the parm cheese. I still had a lot of crumbs left over using 6 pork chops. Next time I will use 3/4C. crumbs and 1/4C. of the cheese. I did dredge them in flour BEFORE the egg wash. I also added a bit of black pepper and seasoning salt to the bread crumbs. They were cooked perfectly, not dry at all. YUMMY!",GREAT! My pork came out so tender and flavorful. I was surprised such a simple recipe with such few ingredients could be so good. The changes I made: doubled the amount of olive oil and left the garlic in the oil. I didn't have an ovenproof skillet so I transferred the pork to a glass dish and poured the oil in over the chops.,"The breading was good and the pork chop stayed moist. However, I found that it was too greasy and didn't stay crisp. I halved the breading and it was still way too much! Will try again though...","My father's side of the family is also Sicilian and they make this same recipe with round steak in place of the pork chops. My dad uses equal part bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, plus a little salt and pepper. He also adds the garlic to the bread crumbs (I wouldn't mess with putting them in the oil). You need to use either very thin sliced round steak or pound the round steak thin with a mallet. I marinate the steaks in milk for the day, to tenderize them. These steaks go great with stuffed artichokes, which use the same breading for their stuffing!","Only thing I changed in this recipe was the breading process: egg, flour, egg again and then crumbs only because this is how I've always done breading and it has always yielded very crispy results. It was delicious, crispy & juicy. Will definitely make again!",Great recipie. I made a few changes . Since don't eat cheese I omitted the Parmesan and changed half the breadcrumbs with polenta. It gave a really good cruch .,,,,,,,,,,

114,"Very creamy and yummy. If you think your sauce is too runny before pouring it over the macaroni, it's not. I was very nervous that my sauce was not thick enough, but once I poured it over the macaroni and baked it, the dish turned out wonderful!",Rave reviews at my house. Can only give 4 stars though as I followed someone else's tips on reducing milk to 1/2C. Adding 2C evapo. milk and 1/2C sour cream. I decided to double the recipe so that we would have leftovers the next day. I put half the mix in one casserole dish and the other in another dish. Baked one and stored the other un-baked one in the fridge to be put in the oven 1/2 hour before dinner the next day. Do not worry that the sauce seems runny when you add it to the noodles. It thickens up A LOT! Right after the cheese melts add it to the noodles and you're in business.,"Rich & Creamy. Looked a little bland, so I added minced garlic (1 tbsp), dry mustard powder (1/2 tsp)& used fresh shredded romano instead of parmesan (if you do use parmesan, use fresh shredded, if you use the grated Kraft kind in the shaker, sauce wont be smooth). Show patience with the roux. If yours came out lumpy, you didnt cook roux right or long enough (stir constantly when cooking roux)","I had to try this recipe ever since I read the rating critizing it for being loaded with ""fat"" ie CHEESE... Duh, that's what Mac and cheese is about!! I made it with large elbow macaroni so the sauce got all inside the pasta... thru in an extra 1/2 inch slice of Velveeta and some white pepper, and jazzed up the crumbs by mixing the crumbs, melted butter, paprika, onion powder, salt & pepper and then sprinkling over the top. Very good ""old-home"" taste!!","I agree that a dash of dry mustard is missing from this recipe. Also, if you realllly want a rich taste, try substituting half of the milk with evaporated milk. The evaporated milk gives Mac & Cheese an amazingly rich & creamy taste. Other than those two things, it's pretty good!",Very good! Everybody went back for seconds. The youngest male in the house (age 21) insisted on taking a bowl to go while his girlfriend took him to buy a couch (LOL!). The parmesan cheese made the consistency ever so slightly grainy and I might skip this ingredient next time.,"This is an amazing base recipe. I boiled the noodles in 1:1 chicken broth and water, added ham and used only one cup of cheddar and added a cup of mozzerella. Wounderful!","When I made the sauce, it looked like more than what I'd need. But, it bakes up firm and creamy. I made a couple tweaks though - I added about a cup more cheese than what it called for. I also used a mixture of marble cheddar, colby, monterrey jack and parmesan. It still needs something though - maybe some pepper and worchester sauce in the sauce. Crumbled bacon would be yummy too. Will probably make again.","This recipe is delicious! If you are wondering what 8 oz. of elbow macaroni should be in cups, it is 1 3/4 cups. Also, bake it in an 8 x 8 glass pan. It fits perfectly. I mixed the bread crumbs with melted butter and spread it on top of the mac and cheese and it browned in the oven. This is now one of our family favorites.","This turned out a little wierd for me. I make my mom's mac and cheese recipe all the time, and that one is very creamy, even after being baked. This one was creamy until I baked it. It seemed to firm up in the oven a lot, almost dry out a little. I didn't like it at first, but ended up liking it more as I ate it, and had a second helping. ;) I really liked the bread crumbs on top. (I used Panko bread crumbs). Like other reviewers said, it is a little bland, and I even added hot sauce, worchestire sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, garlic powder and spicy brown mustard. It does call for a lot of milk; maybe it needs a little more cheese? All in all, it was easy to make and satisfying, just not spectacular. Would have given it three stars, but my babies loved it!","This was really great. I used Barilla Campanelle pasta and it was superb, I think the different shape and texture helped differentiate it from other mac and cheese.","""This Mac and Chese is EVIL!!!"" At least that was all I could hear my girlfriend mumbling between big bites. I took the advise of other reviewers and used a can of evaporated milk in place of some of the milk. The cheese melts nicely and thickens wonderfully. I also used rotini pasta instead of elbow noodles because it holds the cheese sauce better. For you new cooks...you have to heat the flour to a high enough temperature for the thickening process to work...just don't boil it. Don't make this too often, its deadly!","The keys to this recipe are to make the roux very slowly so that it does not get lumpy, and don't worry about how liquid the sauce seems - it firms up nicely in the oven. I used only 1 cup milk, and used 1 cup evaporated milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup half & half, which I think helped with the runniness. I added 1/2 cup of gorgonzola to this recipe to give it an extra kick, and think I might add even more next time. I also added a little worceister and mustard powder to the sauce, and think I might add more next time. This was a very easy recipe to make!","This is a great basic recipe for mac and cheese. I followed other suggestions by using 1/2 cup of milk, 1 3/4 cup of evaporated milk (didn't have enough for a full 2 cups), 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also followed the advice of others taking my time when making the cheese sauce. My cheese sauce came out perfect. I used sharp cheddar, asiago, and colby jack. I used about 2 cups of each kind of cheese. My sauce came out thick because of the amount of cheese I used but I don't mind because I love cheese. I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and mustard for seasoning. I made this for a pot luck at work and got lots of compliments. This recipe is a keeper!","I don't get this recipe at all? It has a ""full bag of cheese,"" but it is so ""BLAND!"" It tasted like homemade milk, noodles, and breadcrumbs. I tried to salvage it by scraping off some of the hefty bread crumbs, which ended up being way too much, and adding a different more flavorful cheese and re-baking. But, it was no luck. It stayed equally as bland but, it only became more grainy. I guess the creamy goodness from mac n cheese comes from good sauce basics. I really wanted to like this, as the picture with the topping looked so good! I was not sure how to modify it though? I hate to rate recipes this low, but unfortunately it was a big waste of ingredients, with all of the cheese, as it ended up getting tossed out.","using canned evaporated milk instead of ""regular"" milk makes all the difference.... keeps the dish from separating. Creamier, silkier----","If you find it bland, here are some suggestions from other readers. Make sure you liberally salt your macaroni water. Use evaporated milk and 1/2 C sour cream. added plenty of black pepper, about 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard, 1/2 onion, chopped and sauteed, a dash of worstershire sauce Some also added 1/2 block of cream cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella with very sharp cheese. Cook crispy bacon mixed with crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs or Ritz crackers.","There huge error in this recipe... Or perhaps typo? It should not be 8oz of pasta, but 16 oz. This yields 8 servings. That would take care of most of the ""soupy"" complaints. As for the bland complaints it's a simple fix. The recipe calls for ""sharp cheddar cheese"" much more flavor than mild. Another good hint is to always salt you pasta water (should taste like sea water). With that said, this recipe was awesome. The simplicity of it makes it flexible. To excite the palate a bit more I've started adding onion power, paprika, and cumin to the cheese sauce. I also added baccon alot of parsley; mainly for color. The breadcrumbs are my favorite part of this dish. I did find that they were a bit soggy. I've altered this part only by adding them the last 10 minutes of cooking. Thank you so much for this recipe. My cheese loving family appreciates it.",This was not what I wanted! I was disapointed with this one. It was bland and my family left the table hungry! If anyone knows a good cheesy mac & cheese recipe please let me know!,"I loved this recipe but doctored it to my tasting. Instead of 3 cups of milk, I used two cups, plus 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of half-n-half. Instead of the 1/2 grated parmesan cheese, I used 1 cup of Monterey Jack, plus I sprinkled grated parmesan into the mix. I used two dashes of mustard powder to give it an extra kick, and also added a cup of ham to make the meal complete! Instead of bread-crumbs, I substituted croutons, maybe 1/4 cup. Delicious--I'll definitely make it again!","I made this as a side with Christmas dinner so the kids would have something to eat and I think the adults enjoyed it even more! I give it 4 stars as rated because of the changes I made according to reviews. I doubled the macaroni and cheddar cheese, yet kept the same amount of milk, buter and flour and it came out perfect. The Parmesan and paprika sprinkled on top really made it out of this world, and I also added a heaping tablespoon of Dijon mustard (as all other mac and cheese recipes i've loved have always used mustard). This ones going in my recipe book!","I made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. This is the best mac & cheese recipe I've ever made, better than my grandma's :). Like others said, I was afraid that the liquid wouldn't cook down but it ended up being so creamy and delish! Thanks for the recipe.","Excellent, although I don't like Parm cheese so I don't use it. But I didn't even miss it. The thing about mac and cheese is that it is mac and cheese...simple... People expect it to be some way over the top recipe that explodes with this and that flavour, but it is simply a nice, heart warming, homey recipe that warms your tummy. Kudos for not adding so much stuff that it overwhelms the whole mac and cheese aspect!","I was very disappointed in this. The sauce was not creamy or really cheesy and the breadcrumbs overpowered the taste (though to be honest, there wasn't much taste on the noodles itself). I'm going to look for another recipe that will be a bit creamier and definitely much cheesier.","Delicious. Though, I want to add my bit about the sauce. I read reviews that said the sauce was a bit runny before baking, but still freaked out when I had a pot full of essentially milk soup. The sauce thickens in the oven. Truly. Promise.","I did not care for this recipe !! I'm sorry to be so blunt but I followed the recipes every detail!! Right now I have 19 people in my house eating, and I'm writing this review because I think it's that bad! DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE!!!","I made this for dinner tonight, it was my first attempt at homemade Mac and Cheese, usually it's my husband that makes it from scratch. I didn't use the bread crumbs, but I did top it with the paprika. We thought this was very good. I used sharp cheddar cheese, mild cheddar cheese and fresh parmesan cheese, which came out to a little more cheese than the recipe called for. My husband said I can make the Mac and Cheese from now on! Thanks for sharing.",The best macaroni and cheese ever made or tasted! It’s not too runny or soupy at all and makes great leftovers (not that it lasts that long in my house). I used Vermont sarp ceddar and Parmesan. I really liked the taste the white chesses created. I can’t stand the kind of macaroni from a box that reminds me of cafeteria food. This recipe is unmistakably baked and homemade. Anyone who says they don’t like macaroni and cheese has never tried this recipe. When I lost the recipe I knew I could enjoy any other kind so I went searching for it on this site. This one is definitely going in my personal recipe book.,I think this recipe is pretty good. There were some people on here that thought it was too bland. My suggestion is to use sharp cheddar. The sharper the better. I used a mixture of New York White Sharp Cheddar and just regular Sharp Cheddar. Make sure you salt the sauce before putting it into your pan. It was delicious. The bread crumbs added a lot of flavor. My husband and I gobbled it up! For those of you who thought it was too lumpy: you have to whisk the flour and butter together. Continue to whisk while you SLOWLY add the milk. It came out perfect for me. I will make this in the future!,,,,,,,

116,"So happy so many people like this recipe. Just to address a couple of issues some people are having: When making the recipe I used ground turkey which was a mixture of white and dark meat. This not only helped add flavor but it also added moisture that helped it to not become crumbly. Adding an extra egg is also a great way to bind it even more and hey! Extra protein! Secondly, this meatloaf is meant to be free-formed on a flat pan. Ground turkey and ground beef cook two different ways. Beef tends to give off a considerable amount of fat and a little juice making it ok (although not at all healthy) to cook it in a loaf pan soaking in its oils.... turkey and chicken on the other hand give off a lot of moisture and very little fat, so basically when you cook it in a loaf pan it is steaming and soaking in turkey water, making for a mushy fall-aparty (yes i made that word up) loaf. I hope this helps some of the future folk who make this recipe. ~drew",I doubled the recipe and took it to a potluck and it went over very well! Cooked Quinoa in chicken broth and added tomato paste to top. It was very good. Making it again tonight and will add an additional egg to the recipe. Thanks for sharing! this is a fantastic recipe!,"This recipe is a family favorite! I love quinoa and I'm constantly trying to find different ways to use it. I do a couple different things with this recipe, just for my own personal taste. -I leave out the hot sauce, since I have 2 small children, but I add some on top of my serving. -I add 1 cup of grated cheese to the meatloaf, I like the extra flavor and it moistens it up a bit. -I haven't yet tried the topping for this recipe because I love my old one too much. 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. ketchup, 1 Tbsp Mustard and a few splashes of Worchestershire. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!",This was awesome. I used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce and the flavor was perfect.,I am always looking for new ways to prepare ground turkey and this meatloaf is one of the best! Perfect combination of flavors and loved the texture. I made this for my very picky husband who raved about it. Next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I will add a little cheese...maybe cheddar. But do yourself a healthy favor and make this recipe.,Thank you for a recipe that lets me serve meatloaf again! I haven't used ground beef for about 12 years and miss a good meatloaf. My poultry-hating hubby LOVED this meatloaf and asked me to make a double recipe next time so he could have a meatloaf sandwich the next day. To round out the menu I served it with baked sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli. It was a wonderful family meal.,This was the BEST meatloaf I have ever eaten! The only change that I made was to scale back the hot sauce to 1/2 TB for my kiddo. The whole family went back for seconds. Thank you for a wonderful nutritious meal.,"I LOVED this! The quinoa is a fantastic flavour in the mix (and an excellent protein source), even my very picky roommate loved it and 3 hours later is still raving about it. I added diced zucchini to the recipe and instead of hot pepper sauce I used sweet chili sauce which gave it a wonderful zip, but not too overpowering. Absolutely lovely!","Fantastic! I couldn't believe how much kick came from the 1 T. of hot sauce though, might scale it back next time for the kiddos. But wonderful meatloaf!! Loved it!",My husband and I LOVE this recipe and so do all of our friends that we've made it for. I use 1lb ground turkey thigh (not as dry as breast) that I can get at Whole Foods. I make meatloaf balls in a muffin pan which I bake at 350 for 30. Great way to make them for lunches or stick in the freezer and take them out as needed.,"Awesome, I did not have tomatoe paste so I used Ketchup instead and it worked out great!","This produced a moist and tender 'meatloaf'. I didn't find that the quinoa added any noticeable flavor. What I really didn't like was how the hot sauce overwhelmed this recipe. It was all we could taste (the spiciness wasn't a problem, just the one dimensional flavor). This could be made so much better and given more dimension with the right mix of herbs and spices. It's a good solid start but needs a bit of work.","DELISH!! I follwed the directions fairly closely except I added 1 TBS of rosemary to meat mixture, used only 1 TBS of brown sugar instead of 2 in the paste. Then cooked in 6 cupcake tins for 40 mins. Then popped them out, turned them over and cooked for 5 mins just to get ride of some of the moisutre. Will definitely make again. Way to go Drew!!",This was a great twist on traditional meatloaf - and healthier too! Served with baked sweet potato and sauteed brussel sprouts.,"I was looking for a ways to use quinoa and came across this recipe. In that regard, this recipe is great. What a terrific way to have quinoa. I gave 4 stars because my husband and I both felt that it was a little bit too sweet. If I make this again I would probably omit the brown sugar and maybe add some mustard.","Absolutely delicious! The whole family really enjoyed this dish. I didn’t add any hot sauce because I wanted this dish to be “kid friendly”, so I did add 1 1/2-Tbsp of BBQ sauce and a dash of liquid smoke flavoring instead. I also had to add 1/3 cup of Panko breadcrumbs because I thought it needed to be a little firmer. For the toping I made my own recipe: ¼ cup ketchup, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp Dijon mustard and 2 dashes liquid smoke flavoring. Thanks for sharing this great recipe Drew!!! 10/04/11: Drew, I was just printing your recipe to make it again and noticed that you are in Pembroke Pines, FL. Can't believe we are so close! I'm just all the way East from you, as I live very close to the beach. I make this recipe quite often, we all love it. Thanks again!","Made this when my mother-in-law and sister-in-law were coming over for dinner. I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did! Had I made it as stated, I'd probably have no leftovers and I really want to enjoy this for a couple of days! This will definitely become a regular menu item!",very good! I also add a tablespoon of beef bouillon to give it a richer taste.,AWESOME. Seriously great. I subbed BBQ sauce for the hot sauce as I have little ones. Also added one small diced zuchinni for an extra veggie punch and moisture. LOVED IT. Served with hot sauce for the adults...AWESOME.,"This is great and easy just as written. The hot sauce makes this so tasty. We eat a lot of quinoa so I make a big batch and freeze it in 4oz servings. I use it just like I would ""instant rice"". Since I'm cooking for two, I made 4 loaves shaped like footballs. We eat two and have an extra meal for later. Like the quinoa, this freezes really well. Just remember to adjust your cooking time. I started checking after a half hour with a thermometer. I also made the topping a little runny. I made little troughs in the loaves, about the size of a pencil, and poured the topping in those. The sauce seeped into the meat and wow! Think I will double the topping next time! One more thought. Try baking the meatlof in a cupcake pan. This way you have little kid size portions. Thanks for the recipe, Drew, it will go on our table many a time.","Doubled recipe for two loafs and followed instructions as given, including an extra egg and cooking on a flat sheet pan. Came out great!","Yum! Definitely a good alternative to traditional meatloaf and I always love quinoa. Instead of the brown sugar glaze, I did a ketchup & Worcestershire glaze with a smidge of sriracha because my family doesn't have a sweet tooth (and I don't usually keep sugar in the house). I also doubled the quinoa because I am always trying to stretch a recipe as far as I can, it didn't make the recipe any less moist. My 7 year olds and my husband both LOVED it. Served with roasted sweet potatoes & Brussels sprouts.","I enjoyed this recipe a lot. There is a bit of a kick to it due to the hot sauce; it's not tongue-searing hot by any means, but it's a consideration if you're feeding it to kids. I thought the 1 egg was enough to bind the meatloaf mixture, but it is important that you let the meatloaf stand at least 10 minutes before cutting it up so that it has the best chance of holding its shape when sliced (which was done easily with a serrated knife). All in all, it was one of the better recipes for meatloaf that I cooked up, and I think I'll keep it in the dinner rotation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,"This classic sauce of sauteed butter, parsley and lemon juice is fantastic. Definitely saute the garlic or else it will taste too raw, even after it's baked. I have used this sauce for almost all types of fish- true cod, halibut, basa, tilapia, sole, trout, and salmon. All tasted superb. ALWAYS increase the garlic. For 4 filets, I use 3 large cloves, 3-4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoon lemon juice. Just make sure you always have less lemon juice than butter or else it will taste too lemony -even when doubling/tripling it. For a large filet of salmon, I triple the amount. Lightly salt and pepper the fish for more flavor and I sometimes add 2-3 tablespoon of buttered bread crumbs or finely crushed (buttered) ritz crackers for an extra crunch. And of course, fresh parsley is better than dried and use real butter, never margarine. 3 stars for original recipe, 5 stars for slight alterations. Simple and flavorful marinade that still lets the flavor of the fish shine through. TIP- do NOT bake for 30 min, especially tilapia, which is so thin. High temperature, quick cooking time is a rule of thumb for all fish. For this, I did 400 degrees, for 10-12 min (at most!). If filets are super thin, try 8-10 min.",This is my recipe and I just wanted to add a note here for everyone that you can substitute the butter for 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil and it tastes great!,"I couldn't believe how easy and delicious this was! I changed the recipe a little based on suggestions from other reviewers...I sautéed the garlic, lemon juice and parsley in the butter before drizzling it over the tilapia, plus I added some red pepper flakes to the mixture. I covered the fillets with chili powder and I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top when there were only 10 minutes of baking time left. Absolutely delicious!","I used an idea someone earlier presented - I baked these fillets individually in foil packets. I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves (my husband is not a huge fan of garlic) and also added onion powder. The fish was flaky and delicious and the juices from the foil packets were so tasty over the rice we had with the fish. Green beans rounded out the meal. My husband and I want to eat healthier and this recipe will become a regular one, I am sure!","Excellent, simple recipe. I do agree with outher members on a few comments. Butter is better, but it can be cut with some EVOO to reduce the saturated fat. It is better with fresh parsley also. And, it is a bit bland without a bit of salt and pepper before covering with the sauteed garlic/butter/oil mixture. I too put the lemon juice over the fish first for a short time. Be careful not to let it marinate too long or the fish will begin to soften (i.e.cook) due to the acid of the juice and the time for cooking will need to be shortened. I cooked it for about 10 min. at 400. Great!!","Easy, quick, delicious -- but DO NOT bake for 30 minutes! Bake for 10 minutes and test for flakiness. If the fish flakes, it's done. Mine was perfect at 10 minutes.","This was very good!!! I did mine a little different. I melted 1 stick of butter and sauteed 3 cloves of garlic and the juice from one lemon in the butter. I seasoned the fish with garlic salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning, poured the butter, garlic, and lemon mixture over the fish and let it sit in the pan with alluminum foil over it for about 2 hours before cooking. I let it cook for about 15 min on 375 and broiled it for about 2 min. It was the best baked fish I've ever had!!","This was quick and easy. I Melted 2 T. butter in saucepan, then sauteed the garlic, parsley, and lemon juice in the butter. I salted and peppered the bottom of the tilapia fillets, then sprinkled the tops generously with Cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's). Then I drizzled the butter mixture over fillets, then sprinkled generously with Parmesan cheese. Baked as directed for 15 minutes. Moist, flaky, and delicious!","The fish is the issue, not the recipe, use another type fish and I'm fine with it. I do not eat Tilapia because of how they are raised. Big fish farms raise fish in huge tanks. They put Tilapia in the tanks to keep the tanks clean, Tilapia eat the feces from the primary fish. After the primary fish are removed the Tilapia are harvested. A recent additional BIG money maker for the fish farms. (I got no problem with making money) That's why you see Tilapia pushed so much. They are basically a freebie to raise (no feed costs!) and almost pure profit. And almost pure.............. ""You are what you eat"" I'm just sayin'.","Incredible. I used a bit more garlic and put it in the melting butter as one member suggested. Wow wow wow. I also used a bit of herb/lemon Old Bay on the filets before putting on the lemon juice and butter/garlic. Cooked until it was just crispy on the bottom. If I have my say, this is the only way I will eat tilapia. Next time I will add a bit more lemon juice but this is fine just as listed. Give this one a go! Can I say 'wow' one more time? :o)","For sure a 5*. Only change I made was to add the crushed garlic to the melted butter drizzle over the fish. My tilapia was frozen and I left it that way- straight into the oven. Came out perfect. Thought the lemon would be too much, was wrong... perfect, light and wonderful. Thanks Eireann.","Oh my gosh, is this ever fantastic! I've made this dozens of times already since first seeing this recipe. The only thing I do differently is that I use olive oil instead of butter, and I've always used Basa fillets instead of tilapia. I create individual pouches for each fillet out of aluminum foil, drizzle the filets with the marinade, and then top them with slices of lemon. I close up the pouch, and bake them in the oven for about 30 minutes. I've always used frozen fish fillets, so it takes about that long to cook from frozen. The amount of delicious liquid each fillet produces as it cooks is lovely, it would be fabulous served over rice. Sooo tasty, I love this recipe!!!","A wonderful recipe! I bought some frozen tilapia at frozen food section at Target. To make this fish more healthy, I used canola oil instead of butter. To add more flavor, thaw and marinate the fish in lemon juice, garlic, canola or olive oil, parsley and fresh black pepper at least a few hours ahead of time. Don't be afraid to add more garlic. I used three cloves to three large pieces of tilapia along with some scallions for extra tang and the fish was yummy! Finally, 15 minutes of cooking time at 375 degrees is sufficient. I used a small Pyrex baking pan covered with aluminum foil in a counter top toaster oven. Serve this fish with any steamed green vegetable and rice and you'll have a healthy dinner. This recipe is a keeper!","This was delicious! I made it exactly as stated, but didn't have to cook for as long as it stated to make sure not to overcook. I think next time I will cook in aluminum foil to preserve even more moisture. Thanks for the great recipe!","I've got to agree with first reviewer. More garlic and butter, cook hot and fast. 30 minutes, especially for thin Tilapia filets, is way too long. 415 degrees for 10 minutes or less. Otherwise, very tasty recipe!","I fixed this tonight for my entire family! Everyone loved it! I also put the lemon, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, parsley, salt, and pepper on each fillet along with lots of butter! YUMMY! I served Onion Rice Pilaf with this as a side dish... recipe also on this site! Also had garden salad and Best Sweet Basic Bread (recipe on this site) with honey butter! Fantastic dinner! This is a keeper! :-)","easy prep and ingredients that one tends to have on hand make this a nice timesaver and light meal. Rubbed Tilapia w/some Old Bay, Salt and pepper, crushed 1 large clove of garlic, and then lemon juice over top. I let it marinate for a bit. I didn't bother melting the butter. Just diced it and placed over top w/fresh parsley. Light nice flavor. If I had white wine on hand, would have used that instead of lemon juice. The mild flavor of Tilapia allows for alot of diverse ingredients.","Very delicious, while also being light and healthy - definitely highlights the flavor of the fish in subtle way. I sauteed minced garlic in the butter, used fresh parsley, added salt and pepper to the fish, and baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.","This might be my favorite fish recipe ever. I took the advice of other reviewers on this site, increasing the butter and garlic and decreasing the lemon juice; I used 4 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and 3 cloves of garlic. I drizzled the lemon juice over the fish first and then cooked the garlic in the butter and parsley. (You have to be a little patient with the garlic; since there's nothing else in the pan to absorb the heat, it'll burn really easily, so be sure to cook it on low heat and take it off before it gets brown. Burnt garlic = icky.) I cooked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and it came out perfectly. I served it with a salad made from mixed greens, grape tomatoes and herbed goat cheese with balsamic vinegar, and even my husband - who is disinclined by nature to notice such things - thought it was a nice complement.","YUM! I used lime juice instead of lemon juice because we prefer lime, salted the fillets before drizzling the sauce over them (I sauteed all the sauce ingredients before topping the fish), and doubled the garlic. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and baked it at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes and it was perfect. I had to fight my younger daughter off of my portion after she had gobbled down her own and my older daughter said she'd love to have tilapia this way again. Thank you for a great recipe!","Very nice. I used flounder because we prefer that. I grated my garlic on a microplane to get more of a mush that would distribute through the sauce more, then added it with the butter, 1 tsp olive oil, salt, pepper into a small sauce pan and simmered it for just a few minutes. I laid my fish out in a pan, seasoned each piece then I spooned the mixture atop each fillet and baked. We will definitely make this again.","This recipe tasted great...after I made some of the alterations suggested by other reviewers. I lightly seasoned the fish with Greek seasoning, and then poured on the lemon juice. I also sauteed the garlic and parsley in the butter before topping the fish with it. I cooked it at 400 for about 10 minutes. My family loved it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,"This is the first thing I cooked in my new crockpot. Taking other reviewers' advice, I browned a 3.66 lb. boneless chuck roast in a little olive oil after rubbing low sodium Montreal Steak Seasoning and 1 chopped fresh garlic clove. I cut the roast in half before setting it in the crockpot as it was so big. I used 2 cans of beef broth instead of water and used small red potatoes, along with 1 sliced onion and I also chopped up some baby carrots, 2 more cloves of garlic and omitted the celery. Halfway through I ended up adding more potatoes and carrots as I didn't think I had enough veggies. I'm glad I did as the veggies I first included basically turned to mush (but goooood mush). I also added garlic pepper and garlic salt along the way to taste as it cooked. This cooked on low from 915am to about 630pm, but really was ready about an hour before. My husband took a little flour with 3/4 of the juice and some more garlic pepper and made an excellent gravy. The juice was so hot from the crock pot that we didn't need to put it into a sauce pan. just whisked it up in a bowl. I have to say, this is the best pot roast. The recipe is a good template that you can play around with to taste. The only things I woud change is that I would use whole baby carrots and add in the veggies (all except the onions) about halfway through instead of straight at the beginning. The other reviewers' comments really helped me in fixing this recipe to my own taste. It worked out wonderfully","Don't make the mistake I did at first. The roast I was cooking was only 2 pounds so I thought, ""Half the weight means half the cooking time."" After only 4 hours of cooking in the crock pot, the roast was edible--it had a nice flavor and we could definately get our teeth through it, but it wasn't even close to the glorious ""fall apart on your plate"" stage. We didn't need all of the roast to feed the four of us for dinner, so I left the rest of it in the crock for an additional 4 or 5 hours and by the time I took it out, it was a fabulously tender and tasty roast. I'm glad I'll know for next time.","I loosely followed this recipe, and chose it because I wanted an alternative to the standard cream of mushroom soup (I don't mind it too much, but I'm not the biggest fan). I had just over two pounds of beef. To avoid having it turn out bland, I added 1 cup of beef broth instead of water, 1/4 c Worcestershire sauce, parsley, and two cloves of garlic minced. I didn't have onion soup mix, so I added around a tablespoon of onion powder, and some salt and pepper. I also cut up one large carrot, two stalks of celery, 5 small potatoes. Then, I let it all sit and marninade overnight in the slow cooker dish in the fridge. I followed the rest of the directions as written, turning on the slow cooker and letting it all cook 10 hours while I was driving to and from or at work. When I got home, it smelled wonderful (my husband had to smell it all day!) and the meat was falling off the bone. I sampled some of the veggies and almost couldn't stop eating them! I made Sky High Yorkshire Pudding with this (highly recommended). With my slight variations, I give this recipe a 5! Great base to start with and adjust to your taste.","It would be very helpful and courteous to review a recipe made EXACTLY the way it is written. It is not beneficial at all to read how you rated your own recipes using another person's name. Marie, your recipe made as written, is excellent. Thank you!","THIS IS AWESOME. Boyfriend and I couldn't believe it! I modified the recipe based on other people's comments. Everyone was saying to add Montreal Steak Seasoning, which I didn't have. So I looked it up and it's basically comprised of pepper, salt, and paprica. For the rub i combined 1 Tbsp each of kosher salt, crushed peppercorns (i crushed), and paprika. I also added about 1 tsp. of garlic powder. This I rubbed on the meat and sprayed a little olive oil over top. To the pot, i added 3 large chopped carrots, six or so small red potatoes (chopped), an onion, and half a container of small fresh mushrooms. Additionally, I added 2 bay leaves, about a tsp. of worshire sauce, and the onion soup mix along with the water. Didn't have celery. SUPER SPICE-A-RIFIC!!! Enjoy!","I have cooked a lot of roast in my day and this is the ONLY time it has come out perfect! I didn't add any vegetables with it except for cutting an onion in half and setting it on top of the roast for the last 3 hours of cooking time. I made mashed potatoes and green beans separate, just don't like my potatoes to taste like anything except potatoes. I also whisked 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and added to the au jus that I transfered to a sausepan. I boiled the au jus mixture for about 5 minutes, whisking often, for a wonderful brown gravy. I was tempted to not cook it as long as the recipe calls for, but please just let it cook and keep check on the liquid level. Roast cooked this way just melts in your mouth! Thanks for sharing your talent!","Used CHUCK roast-important! Quartered red potatos and put in crockpot with baby carrots. Boiled 1 cup water with 2 beef bullion cubes in microwave. Sprinkled most of the dry onion soup over vegetables(just potatos and carrots-didn't use celery and onion), then added stirred beef bullion and stirred the veggies. Browned roast seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Added roast to crockpot,sprinkled remaining dry onion soup mix on roast and spred with a little water, and cooked for 5 hours on HIGH. Removed roast and vegetables to rest and added gravy to skillet whisking in a half cup of water with 2 TBLS flour to thicken. This was abolutely the BEST! I like the strong flavor it gives the carrots, but you may wish to steam them separately.",why do people take a recipe and turn it into another totally differtn recipe using it as a review? Just create a new recipe.,"This was fabulous. I took a few reviewers advice and soaked the roast in red wine vinegar over night. I made a rub with pepper, salt, lemon pepper and freshly minced garlic and then browned the roast on all sides. I was using my mother-in-law's roaster and it didn't have low, med and high so I set it to about 200 degrees for 8.5 hours. I added the onion soup mix, some onion, lots of garlic, carrots, some celery we needed to get rid of and 2 potatoes. We served it with Sky High Yorkshire Pudding (allrecipes.com) which was great! We also had garlic mashed potatoes and an easy green salad. This was an AT recipe and we'll use it again!","Great recipe, but I browned the meat on all sides after seasoning the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning prior to putting it in the slow cooker. This added great depth of flavor to the meat and the finished gravy. I omitted the potatoes from the slow cooker, and oven roasted them instead with olive oil, salt/pepper and whole garlic cloves during the last hour of cooking the roast. A crispy contrast to the luscious gravy. My family loved this meal!","Very, very good--the only thing I did different is added a couple beef bouillon cubes and more water so that I could make lots of gravy. I even chopped up the left over roast put it back in the slow cooker and made a stew with it--it was great! Thank you Marie!","I followed the recipe exactly and was a bit disappointed. I had high hopes starting out but the end result was rather bland. Don’t get me wrong, the meat was nice and tender, the veggies yummy (a little mushy, but a good mushy), and there was plenty of gravy. However it needed flavor, also searing the meat with salt and pepper didn’t do anything for it. What I would do next time is sear the meat with Worcestershire, olive oil, and a little butter. Then after I put the meat into the crock-pot with veggies on top of the meat. I would deglaze the pan with a mix of either Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon and beef stock. Then I would pour the liquid with pan drippings into the crock-pot. I’m not sure if I would use the onion soup mix or not, I think that would depend on the users personal preference.","Really enjoyed this, my construction working fiance & his friends practically inhaled this! I did replace the water with beer and added a little beef boullion... my bloke was overjoyed to find a new way to get beer into his system and it gave it an amazing flavor! There were no leftovers at all.","I used this as a starting point to learning how to make a great roast. The first time I followed the recipe. The 2nd time I tweaked it after reading the reviews. NOW, I have created a masterpiece. This is how I do it:Make sure you use a Chuck roast first of all. Then, brown the meat with salt, pepper, garlic/onion as desired. Then, place in slow cooker. Deglaze the pan with a little beef broth and then add it and addtional can to slow cooker (total 2 cans of beef broth). Pour 1 envelope of dry onion soup mix on top, and 1 tBLsp of Worceshire sauce on top of the meat. Cook on low for 8hrs. After 6 hrs. add quartered red potatoes and carrots to the slow cooker. When done it will be falling apart so remove from slow cooker carefully. Make gravy by using broth and flour/cornstarch/water mixture and heating to just boiling in separate saucepan stirring constantly till desired thickness is acheived. Yum!","To all the reviewers that said ""It was delicious, But I modified the recipe by adding this or changing this"". Once you change anything about an original recipe, you are no longer cooking the recipe but a new recipe that will taste nothing like that one.","For those of you that want a thicker gravy, add flour and onion (for flavor) when you are browning the meat. Browning the meat gives it a nice color and there will be no additional steps at the end for a thicker gravy. I find that beef broth gives a ""tinny"" taste. Using chicken broth lets the taste of the beef shine through. I use chicken broth along with a nice dry red wine. Remember that when adding wine, do not add a wine that is too fruity or has been ""oaked"" (usually older wines). The long cooking time will concentrate any fruit, oak or other flavors that the wine has. Also when adding vegetables, add them about halfway through the cooking time and NOT in the beginning. Delicious!","Fall apart TENDER! I've been making this recipe for many years (before this was even added). There's no need to brown roast first! No need for the salt! THE ONION SOUP MIX HAS ENOUGH SALT IN IT ALONE! Listen- Just throw the roast in the crock, just place carrots around it, (Use the cut up potatoes for mashed, it just goes much better with the tender roast!)cover top of roast with onion soup mix and then TOP WITH CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP. You'll see it's just fantabulous!","In combination of several suggestions in the reviews, this was just the MOST DELICIOUS AND TENDER roast I have ever tasted (it was also my first time making one)! Here's what I did... I sliced a 2½ lb boneless beef chuck pot roast into 4 large serving pieces. It didn’t have much fat so no trimming was necessary. In a deep dish, I rubbed all sides with steak seasoning, fresh ground black pepper, coarse kosher salt, and about 2+ tablespoons ready-to-use minced garlic then poured about 1+ tablespoon balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce on top turning the meat to coat. While that sat, I sliced up a yellow onion then browned the meat on all sides with the onion in extra virgin olive oil. Transferred the meat (including all the juices in the pan) to my slow cooker, added 1 cup beef broth, 1+ tablespoon minced garlic, ¼ packet of onion soup mix (leftover from making dip), fresh ground pepper, garlic salt, oregano, marjoram, thyme, and paprika. Covered and set to low for 6-8 hours. Just about 2 hours before it was done, I added whole baby carrots, chunks of celery, red onion, and mushrooms. Instead of adding potatoes, I made mashed potatoes and brown gravy from the juices. The original recipe is a good “base”. Just be creative and use your spices!","I have prepared my pot roasts this way quite a few times now, and am finally getting around to reviewing the recipe! Sometimes I add a teaspoon or two of Better than Bouillon beef base, a clove or two of minced garlic, or use beef broth rather than water, but the basic recipe always remains the same, and always turns out delicious. I had planned on making this today, actually. I bought my beef in bulk from a local farmer who raises grass-fed cows for the first time ever, and was so excited to pop my first grass-fed roast into the crock pot this morning! I defrosted it, unwrapped it, and then realized it was actually a 7-bone chuck roast. Not a boneless chuck roast. I had already defrosted it, so I went ahead and browned it, then tried to stuff it in my crock pot. No such luck. It wasn't going to fit. So, it sat in my refrigerator in my covered roasting pan ""marinating"" in the onion soup mix and water all day while I did some research on how to cook a 7-bone roast in the oven. Just in case anyone wants to use this type of cut, or finds themselves in a similar bind, here's what I did: bake covered at 280 for 4 hours, adding the veggies at the last hour. The result was fall-off-the-bone, slice-with-a-fork, melt in your mouth tender and absolutely delicious! Crock pot is good, but this method produced a roast equally as good. The next ""variation"" I'm going to try is to make my own onion soup mix from a recipe also here on AllRecipes. Can't wait!","Great base recipe! I took the advice of others and browned my meat in olive oil but first I rubbed it with Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides. I used a 1lb bag of carrots and about 5 red potatoes - skins left on, whole onion - sliced, and 2 stalks of celery. I used 2 cups of water and boiled it on stove with 2 beef boullion cubes. I added the onion soup mix to the boiling beef broth and poured mixture over meat and veggies in crock pot. I also added about 1/4C worcestershire sauce. I added some garlice pepper & garlic salt to the crock pot. Cooked on low for 9 hours and meat was falling apart! I removed the roast from the crock pot and cut it up then added corn starch mixed with cold water to the crock pot to thicken up the juices into a gravy. Everything was perfect!!",MMM.... MMM.... MMM.... yummy! Yeah that sum's it up. Stop reading all the reviews and just try it... your gonna love it.,"adding my 2 cents! I did alter it based on other reviews...2 pkgs of o.s.m instead of 1, instead of water I used a half cup of beef broth and a half cup cooking wine, and I also threw in a can of cream of mush. soup....I know the point is to get away from a soup mix (cream soup that is) but I thought it was the best roast that I have ever made!!! Oh one more thing...I omited the potatoes and made mashed instead! I know that people sometimes have something to say about people rating a recipe after they have added thier own tweeks, but isint it what its kind of about?? getting ideas from others and tweeking them to suit our own taste? I d k...Just saying give this a try! It is awesome! My veggies were perfectly cooked as directed in the recipe!","Used a 3.5lb rump roast instead and it worked out amazingly!! The meat just fell apart and was full of flavour. I did modify the recipie as others suggested. Seasoned the beef with ground pepper & garlic salt. Added a can of beef broth and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to recipe. I also added mushrooms during last 4 hours of cooking. At the end, took out all the veg and thickend the sauce with flour. Used more potatoes then what recipe called for and omitted the celery. Best roast I ever made!! Very tastey.","This is an old standby at my house. my mother made this many times while I was growing up, and it was one of my favorite meals. My husband now loves this pot roast! I don't always brown the roast first, depending on how rushed I am that morning. The last time I made this, I peeled and sliced the potatoes the night before and stored them in a ziplock bag with water. I placed the raw beef, seasonings, and onions in a crockpot liner sealed with a twist tie and popped it in the fridge. The next morning, I just had to untie the crockpot liner and place it in the pot. I drained the potatoes and opened a bag of peeled baby carrots to add to the pot. Easy and delicious!","This is a staple in my house...we LOVE it! I use garlic salt and pepper, and Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix. I also use baby carrots and sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. I add a can of beef broth to ensure there is enough liquid to cover the meat. Cooks on LOW for 10-12 hrs, and is just perfect! I make ""pot roast burritos"" with the leftovers...hubby loves those! :) An EASY, no-hassle, tasty pot roast!!! *note - close all of your bedroom doors when you turn on the crock or else your rooms will smell like pot roast for days...)","I have been doing pot roast like this for years. The bonus is, make an extra roast at the same time, or use leftover roast and broth left in cooker for beef and noodles, or chop leftover beef and veggies ad back to broth, add frozen mixed veggies, chopped cabbage, and a little V8 juice and you have delicious homemade beef vegetable soup!!!!!!!!!","WOW!!! Let me tell you, I have tried to make pot roast several times already but I gave up because the meat ended up being dry. I used stewing beef, rump roast, and other cuts. Now I know YOU MUST USE CHUCK ROAST...that's what makes this recipe super! I took the advice of other reviewers and rubbed the meat with Montreal Seasoning but I did not brown it--just put it in the crockpot. I also used a can of beef broth instead of water. I added vegetables half way through and used red potatoes because it's not as starchy as white. My son said the beef just melts in your mouth! Tasty, delicious and great comfort food! I've always wanted a good beef roast/stew recipe and now I have it! THANK YOU, Marie, for sharing and telling us to use the right cut of beef!","Really loved the roast. It was tender, juicy and cut with a fork. However, I made a mistake. I used both the dry onion soup mix and vegetable broth. I should have used one or the other. Had I added extra salt, it would have been way too salty. Next time I make this, and I absolutely WILL make it again, I'll take care to watch the salt content. I'd much rather add more to my plate than risk the dish being over salty. And I did add extra carrots and potatoes. With a 3 pound chuck roast, I added at least 6 nice size potatoes and 2 pounds of carrots. It was a terrific meal, served with nice hot biscuits.","My 87 year old Dad prefers hot meals for supper even in the summertime. I made this crockpot meal to avoid heating up the house. Because it was just him and me, I only used a 2 pound chuck roast. Next time I'm making a bigger one. This was fabulous! Dad raved about it and be both wished we had more leftovers. A very easy but absolutely delicious meal!","Very tasty roast. Quick notes: 1/2 the soup mix, it can make it way too salty (add maple syrup to cut of need be), sear with steak seasoning, de-glaze with red wine and add to the slow cooker. Worcestershire works well (don't over do it though or you are back to the salty problem). Toss in a bay leaf and you are good to go. Have tried this a few times and am constantly tweaking, but follow other suggestions and add your own flair and you will be laughing all the way to the dinner table.","I tried this recipe the last time I made pot roast. I prefer a bone-in roast, as I think it is more flavorful. To the soup mix in a measuring cup I add 1/4c red wine and 3/4c water. I cut slits in the roast and insert slivers of fresh garlic, then sprinkle season salt, fresh ground black pepper, Itallian seasoning, and a light dusting of flour on one side and brown that side of the roast in a dutch oven with about 1T oil, while seasoning and flouring the top side before flipping over and browning the other side, then transfer it to the crock pot, pour the soup mixture over it and sprinkle with 1 chopped onion and 1 thinly sliced carrot and thinly sliced celery stalk. About an hour before roast is done I add baby carrots amd baby potatoes (no need to peel) from the bag and half a bag of frozen pearl onions, turn the heat from low to high and cook for an hour more or until vegetables and meat are tender, then remove meat and vegetables and arrange on a platter. The flour and juices left in the pot create a nice light gravy that can be served alongside to pour over meat and vegetables.","This was my first pot roast EVER, and it was so easy! I've made it twice, and I've always used a roast that was less than 3 lbs. I used beef broth instead of water and threw in tons of extra veggies. I also took the advice of some of the other reviews and added Worcestershire sauce and used a Montreal Steak rub on the meat before browning. I've left this roast to cook for up to 10 hours on low, and it's turned out great both times!","add 1/4 cup red wine, 8 oz. mushrooms, 4 cloves garlic, and 14 oz. can beef broth. Thicken gravy with a 2 oz. brown roux.","A very good basic slow cooker roast. After reading reviews, I made a few changes...I inserted slivered garlic into roast; browned the roast on all sides, then removed to the slow cooker. I browned an additional onion in the skillet, then deglazed the pan with 1 cup of red wine, instead of adding water. I added 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, the soup mix, then poured it over the roast. I cooked on high for 4 hours, added the veggies, then cooked another 4 on low. My entire family loved it. Next time, I'll brown sliced mushrooms to add to the mix!",,
119,"I make a version of this recipe all the time and in my opinion it's the only way to make an eye roast. This post may help some of you. First I like to preheat the oven at 500 for 20 min. it gets the walls of the oven nice and hot so it holds the heat longer. Then with a pastry brush I paint the whole roast with a browning sauce you can find it in the dry gravy mix section at your local supermarket it comes in a little bottle with an orange lable and lid. Then I season the roast with garlic powder,salt,and fresh ground black pepper. once the roast is seasoned I place it on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan FAT SIDE OF ROAST UP! VERY IMPORTANT. AS THE FAT MELTS IT BASTES THE ROAST! Put it in the oven for 7 min. per pound then turn off the oven and leave in for 20 min. per pound. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR TO PEEK AT THE ROAST. WHEN TIMER GOES OFF REMOVE FROM OVEN AND LET THE ROAST REST FOR 20 MIN. VERY IMPORTANT TO LET REST! SO THE JUICES SETTLE DOWN INTO THE ROAST. SLICE THIN AND ENJOY!! YOUR GONNA LOVE THIS RECIPE I PROMISE YOU. SO EASY!","I had a 4 lb eye of round so I cooked it at 475 for 28 minutes. We had some unexpected delays, so I decided to just leave it in the oven rather than take it out after the 2.5 hours. It was probably in another hour or so. This was done to PERFECTION for us! We like our roast beef bright pink all the way through, but not rare. This hit it spot on! For seasonings I rubbed the roast with a combination of salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and thyme. I probably used about a teaspoon of salt and about 1/2 teaspoon of each of the others. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!","The most bizarre sounding recipe I'd ever heard and one of the best roasts I've ever had. Whatever thermodynamics were at work here were great. The outside was seared and crusty while the inside was medium rare, tender and juicy. The flavor combination was delicious. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.","You know, I never make comments on anything over the internet..but have to on this recipe. I was unbelievably surprised! Following the directions to a tee (except using my own rub for the meat) this eye of round came out perfectly! My husband is in the food business and was also amazed that an eye of round could come out so tender and juicy and very full of flavor. We like our meat medium and it came out slightly pink. For those who like it more done I would suggest turning on the oven to 350 after the 2 1/2 hours and check the temperature after 20 min. I'll also try this method for other types of roast as well.","I'm always on the the lookout for easy,...if not to say idiot-proof recipes,...that make my time in the kitchen minimal!This certainly fit the bill!As others,...I followed the recipe,...using a 7 lb. eye of round roast!Following this method,...I had to leave the roast in for 49 minutes at 475 degrees!I was skeptical,...especially when my smoke detectors went off!But,as instructed,...after the time required,...I dutifully turned the oven off for the 2 1/2 hours!What transpired after the time required...was nothing short of awe-inspiring!It had the perfect hue of pink in the middle,...and was mouth-wateringly succulent!This will be my go-to roast beef recipe 'til the end of time!I thank you,Lyn,...for making this guy's life just that much easier!Bless your heart!!!","THE BEST! i had a 5 lb roast, and we don't like it too red (well, I do, but the kids get kind of grossed out). To get it a little closer to medium I roasted it at 475 for 39 minutes. after 90 minutes in the turned-off oven, the meat thermometer read 125, but I figured it had definitely been up to at least 145, as it should be. I took it out and covered it with tin foil. While the roast rested, I put fries in the oven and made up a package of Aus Jus mix, adding the small amount of juice and scrapings from the bottom of the roasting pan. The roast was sooo warm and juicy when I cut into it! I got out my handy, dandy Electric Food Slicer, and sliced up the roast very thin. Then, I warmed the beef in the aus jus for a few minutes. Finally, while the meat soaked, I make up some 'Weck rolls. Slice fresh deli kaisers, place them face down on a cookie sheet, and brush with a small amount of water. While still damp, grind coarse salt on the tops of the rolls. Pop them in the oven for a few miutes to toast. Serve sliced beef on the rolls with aus jus on the side. Horseradish is a great compliment!","I foresaw a problem with this recipe because I have an old gas oven with very poor insulation, I knew it would be stone cold before the roast was done. Instead of turning my oven totally off I left it on around 200 F. I didn't have very many juices in my pan for doing this, but the initial high temperature locked moisture into the meat and it turned out great.","Before this recipe, I had never made a roast. I'll admit, I was really scared to do it the way that the recipe suggested, at such a high temp. I only had a 1.5 lb. roast so I didn't cook it as long (7 mins per lb., so I only had it on high for about 10 mins). It turned out perfectly!! I was so happy, and I ended up making a rump roast yesterday the exact same way. My family loved it. Thanks for the fabulous method...I will never cook a roast any other way!","This recipie is awesome. I was also skeptical when I read it. My family doesnt like their meat rare so I cook it for about 9 minutes per pound. I also make holes in the meat and insert sliced cloves of garlic, then season with salt and pepper. Comes out perfect everytime. Another plus... its so easy!!!","Tender, juicy, absolutely superb!!! 5 stars with no modifications for a cut of beef that is known for it's toughness! For my family's personal taste, I created a paste of fresh garlic, dried minced onions, fresh cracked black pepper, hickory smoked sea salt (from William and Sonoma), tsp of liquid smoke and olive oil. Spread the paste on the roast and let it come to room temp (an hour +) before popping it into the oven using the exact directions stated in the recipe!!!! Came out beautifully..... Sliced the remainder of the roast extremely thin and used the leftovers the next day in french dip sandwiches. To prepare the Au Jus: mix 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1/2 tbsp rosemary, 3 bay leaves, a cup of low sodium soy sauce, 1 tsp peppercorns, 6 cups of low sodium beef broth and bring to a low rolling boil for 30 minutes or so. Strain and serve with the sandwiches - try this recipe I GUARANTEE you will not be disappointed! Thanks LynB for the submission!!!","I was very sceptical when I first tried this recipe. Wow. A cheap eye of round melts in your mouth. I have been on a high protein diet for some time now and this recipe fits right in. I trim every bit of fat and silver skin off the roast and what's left is pure heaven. If you use a bigger eye of round, lower the time to 5 minutes a pound or it will over cook. LOVE IT !!!!! Bryan","I can see that my opinion is clearly in the minority here, but I was disappointed with this recipe. I've made it twice now, hoping for a miracle - no such luck. The recipe isn't necessarily at fault - the meat reached the stated temperature and was a beautiful pink color, BUT this cut of meat is TOUGH. It also had very little taste. This was the type of meat you start chewing and it just gets bigger and bigger in your mouth! YUCK!!! Sorry to disagree with almost everyone else who reviewed this recipe, but we will stick with a chuck roast or a standing rib roast.","Bottom line: Awesome result! Key takeaways: 7 minutes/pound at high heat 20 minutes/pound at lowest oven setting (200 works fine) will do the job (no need to leave for 2 1/2 hours and that may not be safe according to USDA et al.) Turning oven off for low-temp portion may yield unpredictable results due to oven heat retention variability. -------------------------- My story... Found a ""Manager's Special"" eye round roast at my local market while shopping for other stuff and picked up an ""organic, vegetarian fed"" 2.3 pound roast for about 8 bucks. I've had problems with this cut being tough in the past and decided to Google for a better way to cook it. Found this recipe and, to my great astonishment, it worked perfectly with some slight modifications. I had a 2.3 pound ""eye roast"" and, so, cooked at high temp (475) for 16 minutes. 2.3 lbs * 7 minutes/pound high temp = 16 minutes My oven is old and probably not well insulated so I decided to put it on ""warm"" for the low-temp part which is about 180-200 degrees. Based on another comment here, and my own cooking ""spidey sense"" I guessed that it would only take about 20 minutes/pound to finish off the cooking. Started cooking at 7pm, high temp for 16 minutes, went to 200 degrees, took it out at 8:10. Internal temperature at center of thickest part was about 127 degrees which should yield ""rare"" on the thickest part. On a roast, carry over cooking will will bring the temp up about 10 degre","As a precursor: we like our meat medium-rare, and we have a family member who is especially picky about that. Also, we used a 2.5lb eye round roast that was even in diameter along the entire length. Our oven is electric and very well insulated, so it holds it's heat well. I combined the advice of some of the reviewers and did the following: 1. Used Gravy Master to cover the roast, then added plenty of garlic salt and ground pepper to make a nice spice crust. 2. Placed the roast in a roasting pan and put it in a 500 degree oven, lowered the temperature to 475 degrees and cooked it for 7 min/lb x 2.5 lb = 18 min. 3. Did NOT open the oven and lowered the temperature to 200 degrees (which our oven may not have even gotten down to). Left the roast in for 20 min/lb x 2.5 lb = 50 minutes. 4. Removed the roast and let it sit for 10 minutes before carving. Results: the roast was medium to medium-rare but closer to medium, with a nice medium-pink hue throughout the length of the roast. We all prefer it a little darker pink but regardless, the meat was incredibly tender. The tenderness was what you'd expect of medium-rare and it was even more moist than you'd expect for medium-rare by any other cooking method we've tried, so overall it was VERY enjoyable. This is definitely the only way I'll cook roast beef from now on! Future modifications: I would like to get it closer to medium-rare, so I will lower the time of 20 min/lb at 200 degrees to 12-15 min/lb.","I cater a large number of events each year - from small gatherings to large receptions and have always hesitated when it came to serving beef, as I never knew how it would turn out for sure. Last month I was hired to do a very upscale wedding for 250. The groom's only request was that I serve some sort of beef - preferably tenderloin as some part of the meal. Scared to death at the idea of ruining a $10 a pound piece of beef, I came straight to allrecipes in search of a no-fail way to cook it and found this delightful recipe. I did a test run on an eye of round roast and was absolutely delighted with the outcome. When the bride and groom came for their tasting, I served eye of round cooked in this manner as an appetizer three ways - on bruchetta brushed with garlic/olive oil, chilled and wrapped around chilled asparagus that had been dressed with a vinegarette and on tiny homemade yeast rolls spread with a homemade horseradish cream. The couple raved about all three and approved the dishes for the reception. They both said it was the best tenderloin they had ever had. I proceeded to tell them that it was eye of round and that if I served it instead of tenderloin they would save a considerable amount of money (about $7 a pound) that sealed the deal! Needless to say, the guests raved about the beef ""tenderloin"" and I was bombarded with requests for how it was cooked. I confessed that it was not tenderloin and referred them to your website. THANK YOU!","IF YOU HAVE A GAS OVEN: I only gave 4 stars for not indicating electric or gas which would have prevented a number of FAILS. You will have to leave your oven on, just at a very low temp for gas stoves. Followed directions with a few adjustments for a 2 lbs eye of round. Rubbed w/EVOO, salt, pepper, Slap Ya Momma seasoning. Let it cook at 475 for 14 min, reduced to 200 degrees for 50 min and turned the oven OFF for 40 min WITHOUT opening the oven at any point. Gave me a perfect medium rare plus! Will definitely do again.","I can't believe how good this turned out. I like ours medium well so here's what I did: I used a 3-1/2 lb. roast rubbed with olive oil, salt/pepper, and sliver of garlic stuffed to the sides of the meat. Preheated the oven to 500F for about 20 mins then turned down the temp. to 475. I roast for 9 mins/lb. then when the time was up I turned down the oven again to 195F for 30 mins. Finally turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for another 2 hours. Perfection!! The outside was seared and crispy saltyness heaven! The center inside is perfect light pink. We had it for dinner and then lunch the next day on french roll! Yummy. Can't wait to make it again.","I wasn’t skeptical of the method as much as I was of my 5 year old Frigidaire gas oven being able to retain enough heat to cook the meat. So, acting on my gut instinct, I followed the recipe up to a point. I kept the oven completely off for the first 1.5 hours of the 2.5 hour cooking time, the outside of the oven was very cold to the touch, so I turned the oven back on to 180 degrees F and cooked it at this temperature for the remaining hour. Prior to cooking the 2.87lb roast, I inserted garlic cloves, sprinkled a generous amount of salt and pepper, garlic powder, and placed a few bay leaves on top for fragrance. I also coated the roast lightly with olive oil. This cooking method doesn’t yield much au jus, so I supplemented it with a pre-made au jus which worked perfectly. The only thing I would tweak slightly when making this recipe again, is the end cooking temperature. In the last half hour of cooking I will increase the oven temp to 300 F so the roast will be warmer when served. I would give this recipe two thumbs up with the additional adjustments I mentioned. The roast turned out tender and moist and very tasty with a pink center. It was not tough or dry and my family really loved it! Take a look at my photo of the end result! Thanks.","Love this recipe... I've made this several times (with different seasonings each time) and it always turns out perfect. I wanted to write this review because of some of the reviews from people who have tried this recipe and found that the roast was cold or too well done. Before seasoning the roast, I make sure it is fully defrosted, let it sit at room temp for about an hour, and pat it dry. This prevents the meat from ""steaming"" in the oven and getting tough. You also want to add the seasonings to the roast no more than 5 minutes before cooking, as any salt will wick the moisture out of the roast. I use a Le Cruset rectangular casserole dish, which is a heavy, 4-inch deep ceramic dish that holds in the heat. Using a metal baking pan won't do this, and I think that's why some people end up with cold/ underddone roasts. A corningware casserole dish may work as well, but since I got my Le Cruset as a gift, I use it especially for this recipe. My oven is a 20-yr-old GE electric and works great for this recipe, but newer ""convection""-type ovens may cook the meat too much during the 21 minutes that the oven is running at 475. Anyway, hope this helps anyone who tries this recipe for the first time. It's definitely a favorite of ours, and it helps to keep the food budget under control because we can buy the eye round when it's on sale and still have a great Sunday dinner.","Well, I couldn't resist buying a 6 lb. eye of round roast as the Giant by me had a big sale on them. Now, I love roasts but never know what cut is what, so I went looking online where I came across this recipe. I read reviews and saw that although they were mixed at times, they were overwhelmingly good so I decided to give it a try. My version - In the bottom of the roaster I put two onions sliced thick, two turnips, carrots, & parsnips. I rubbed the roast with chopped garlic, salt, pepper, rubbed sage, and thyme then placed it on top of the veggies. The roast had a thin layer of fat on one side but still I drizzled a little olive oil over the top and gave it a pat and inserted a thermometer that can be read outside the oven. I cooked it 42 min. - 7 min./lb, as stated in the directions. I shut off the oven a bit nervous that it wouldn't turn out. About two hours later the thermometer/timer screamed that the meat was at temperature. I was astonished. I took the meat out and let it rest on the cutting board as I gave the veggies another 20 minutes at 475 to get good and caramelized. My husband and I had been salivating the whole time it cooked. As the first cut was taken we saw the beauty of a perfectly cooked roast. So moist inside! And for us, there was a good amount of juices in the pan that I made a gravy from (for the mashed potatoes cause goodness knows the meat didn't need it!). We both agreed the recipe was a keeper and are savoring leftovers! Thanks so much!",Fantastic! After 35 years of searching I finally found a way to make a perfect roast beef. I sprinkled only a 2.06 pound eye-of-round roast with McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning and I cut the recipe cooking times exactly in thirds. I baked it for 14 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 1 hour 40 minutes. It was perfect! The roast cooks evenly all the way through so no slices were too well-done and none were too rare. This was so perfect I can't rate it high enough!,My recipe is even simpler and faster... and just as good. Preheat oven to 500 degrees and roast at 500 at 5 minutes per pound. Turn off oven and wait only 1.5 hours to remove and carve. This yields a medium rare roast. Lots of pan juices and nice crust but very tender inside. My favorite roast.,"Using this recipe with a few alterations resulted in the best roast I have ever had in my life! I rubbed the outside of the roast with some kosher salt and browning sauce. I was in a bit of a hurry but given a little more time I probably would have cut some garlic into the meat and used a few more seasonings. I cooked the roast on a broiler pan so that the drippings could be used to make gravy. This is just a personal preference but I like my meat well done. And turning off the oven after 20 minutes to leave a roast sitting in there for 2+ hours doesn't seem safe or conducive to it actually being cooked through. No oven is going to stay warm for 2+ hours after being turned off. Instead I cooked the roast on 475 for 20 minutes. Then turned down the oven to 350 for one hour. Then turned it down to 200 for another hour and a half. Some parts were still a bit pink for my liking. Perhaps next time I will try 250. Instead of being chewy like most roast recipes, the meat was moist and tender. And the gravy was a perfect addition. Definitely a recipe to save and use over and over again. Maker sure you use an eye-of-round roast, I also tried it with a top round and it just wasn't as good.","I followed the advice of other reviewers - rubbed the roast (2.5 lbs) with EVOO, sea salt, and some Italian seasonings. Put it in at 500 degrees, lowered the temp to 475 and cooked it for 20 mins. Then turned the oven down to 200 degrees for 2 hours. Then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for about 25 mins. It was medium - exactly how we hoped it would be. Super delicious and easy! THANK YOU Lyn!","My roast was only 1.71 pounds. I spent at least an hour going through reviews to create my own spin on it. Final result: Seasoned the meat with steak seasoning, garlic powder, onion power, salt, and pepper. Preheated the oven to 500 for 20 minutes. Baked roast on wire rack (pan below to catch drippings) for 12 minutes. Lowered temperature to 170 and baked for an additional 50 minutes. When I took it out of the oven, I let it sit for about 15 minutes. The results were amazing! Great flavor, and the roast came out a perfect medium rare temperature. It was also super tender. Will definitely make this again!","This meat was so tender that I almost thought I was eating Prime Rib. I followed the recipe of 7min per lb and as others suggested, instead of turning the oven completely off, I turned it down to 200 degrees for 2 1/2 hrs. The meat was medium rare and warm to eat. The only way I will ever cook this meat again!","I notice that some people have success with this recipe and others don’t. You can use this method for any roast… eye of round, bottom round, rump, chuck, or tri-tip. This is what I do. It sounds complex, but is actually very easy. First, you can use any marinade, or rub you wish. The results are in the cooking method and nothing else. Since every oven cooks differently, you will need to use a thermometer. I have one that can be set to a final cooking temp. You place the probe into the thickest part of the roast and it has a cord that extends to a battery operated module outside the oven. Just set your temp… e.g. 140 degrees and the alarm will sound when the roast is finished cooking. Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Once the oven is pre-heated, turn down the temperature to 475 degrees. Place the roast into the oven with the probe inserted and the temperature timer set. Cook for 7 minutes per pound then turn off the oven and let the roast set. The temperature will continue to rise. Once the temp is approximately 75 % of your desired finished temperature, open the oven door!!! The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise. Once the temp starts to drop (110 to 115 degrees) close the oven door. Let the roast sit until the temp is approximate 70% of your desired finished temperature… about 100 degrees. Then turn the oven back on at 350 degrees, until the temp rises and your alarm goes off. Remove the roast from the oven and let set for 20 minutes, tented with aluminum f",,,,,,,,,

121,"Oh my, but this was good. I did make a few changes (of course). My husband expects MEAT on his dinner plate, so I squeezed the innards out of a couple of large-ish hot Italian sausages and browned it up in a tiny bit of EVOO. Then I added some sliced fresh crimini mushrooms that needed to be used up. My canned tomatoes were the plain, common garden variety, so I threw in some chopped onion and minced garlic. Deglazed the pan with some white wine and used more spinach than called for. An entire bunch, actually. The DH has placed a moritorium on me buying anything new to stuff into my over-burdened freezer, so I had to use a bag of frozen three-cheese ravioli instead of the tortellini. But hey, it's the same thing, only flat, right? Also I didn't have any whole milk, so I had to use non-fat, but it didn't seem to hurt anything. This was fantastic! The sausage and mushrooms gave the sauce a nice beigey color. I'm sure it would have been prettier with the tortellini, but I had to make do. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!","I made this for company last night and it was a huge success! I added diced chicken breasts sauteed with garlic, basil, and rosemary in olive oil. For the sauce, I sauteed sliced baby portabella mushrooms with onion and garlic which I added to the tomato mixture. I also added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, instead of just 1/4 to the sauce - because really, you can never have enough cheese! It could use more spinach than the recipe calls for, so next time I'll make that change - but this was very wonderful and easy and I will definitely be making it again!","I thought this was very good. I did not use heavy cream, I used FF milk and used a bit of cornstarch to it so the sauce would thicken slightly. I also used fresh basil. I think that gives the dish a nice bright taste. I will make this again.","Lovely! Nice light flavor, although I did make some minor adjustments. I used a plain can of diced tomatoes, and doubled the minced garlic. I left out the onion. I think I would have been safe with even a little more garlic (but I really like garlic). Also, I used milk instead of heavy cream, which should help on the fat and calorie side. I prefer corn starch as a thickening agent (just be sure to cut the amount by half - you'd need twice as much flour to do the same job). I was impressed with the flavor of the sauce, and didn't notice too much of a pink tinge that turned off one reviewer. However, next time, I'll use fresh tomatoes, because I was kinda turned off by the flavor of the canned tomatoes. In all other respects a wonderful and simple dish that looks and tastes like it took forever! Will definitely make again!","Altho I think this needed a lot more cheese, which I did add, we thought this recipe was delish! I also sauteed portabello mushrooms to add to the dish. Because we don't like soggy fresh spinach, I did not cook it in with the sauce, but tossed it in with the pasta at the very end jusy to wilt it. Enjoyed by my whole family Lela and thank you!","This was delicious!! I followed the recipe almost exactly- the only difference was I used italian diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano because I didnt have the one specified. Also I used 5 cloves of fresh garlic and minced it up. I think it could have used even more than that. Otherwise I followed everything and it turned out wonderful, My hubby loved it and my 1 year old ate a good amount of it too! It was a good way to sneak a veggie into him. I recommend this to everyone to try and will definatly make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.","This is a really nice, easy recipe that looks beautiful and tastes better than I've gotten in some restaurants. I basically followed the recipe, but had no fresh spinach, so used half a box of frozen. Everyone loved it!","My family and I loved this dish...my one year old kept asking for more! It was so simple, and it is delicious. I actually didn't have any cream on hand, but I had everything else, so I just used evaporated milk in place of the cream and it turned out great. I'll definitely make this one again!","I have never received so many compliments on a meal before! It was a little runny, but I seemed to be the only one who thought so. I think next time I might try adding some shrimp to this, everyone said it tasted as though it already had it in it anyway. Great recipe, thanks!",This was a great dish. Unfortunately I ate too much of it!! One plate full just wasn't enough. I followed the recipe exactly and everyone at my dinner party thought it was amazing. Look for frozen Tortellini if you want to save some money. It's much cheaper then the fresh stuff-,"I used this sauce recipe over bowties as I'm not a fan of tortellini and it was awesome!! My sauce was a little thin, but I used skim milk and light cream to help with calories/fat. Next time I would add more spinach and and a tiny bit more garlic.****update - it goes great with gnoochi!!","Def. a sound recipe! The color did turn out to be a bit pink, however that didn't bother my boyfriend or myself. I would suggest adding more spinach than called for, it seems to get lost in the pasta otherwise. ((used one bunch myself, and it still seemed a tad little)) I did a combination of cheese stuffed ravioli and farfalle which turned out to be a winner. ((Im in china right now and I swear there is no tortellini here!!)) I also chopped up some fresh tomatoes to throw in! Made the flavor more intense. I also used fresh basil which made the dish come alive, used two tablespoons however. ((love basil)). More garlic could have been used as well ((used 5 cloves)) :) Overall it was a great and easy dish!","This is a delicious recipe! I followed it more or less exactly... and it turned out perfect! I did end up using a whole 20oz pkg of cheese tortellini, and then made the sauce as the recipe called, and it was still plenty of sauce for the extra 4oz of tortellini. This is definitely going to become one of my kitchen standard recipes! :)","I came upon this recipe after my original plan for dinner fell through. I was really hopeful, but unfortunately for me, it tasted extremely bland.","This is a pretty good dish. I didn't have fresh spinach do I had to use frozen. Next time, I'll make it with fresh. I added mushrooms and fresh tomatoes along with canned. I didn't have cream so I used half and half and thickened it with cornstarch. This is a pretty versatile recipe and would probably be good with penne or by adding chicken or shrimp. Thanks!","This was excellent! Quick and easy to prepare on a busy night, and a great way to get the fam to eat spinach!! My Husband and kids gave it ""two arms up!"" (our voting system, to decide if Mama should fix something again) I doubled the recipe so that we would have left overs. I only had one can of diced tomatoes, so I used a can of stewed tomatoes for the other. I just cut them up like diced, and it worked great. Will definitely make again!!","I think I noticed too late that a lot of ppl that gave this really high reviews added something, meat or more cheese or something. And that is what it was lacking - something. Following the recipe exactly, it was pretty bland. I think some hot italian sausage would probably really improve it or try to follow one of the other reviewer's suggestions.",Excellent. I used about half a bag of fresh spinach and substituted half and half for the heavy cream. simmered it about 15-20 min.,"I love this recipe. It is one of my Christmas Eve buffet dishes. I double the recipe and add fresh basil instead of dried. Frozen spinach works just as well as the fresh. I prepare the cream sauce the night before. Since I have a large crowd, I find either penne pasta or ziti is more cost effective. I use 2 to 3 pounds of pasta and the doubled recipe is enough sauce in my opinion. This will be the 3rd year in a row on the menu and it's always a crowd pleaser! Thanks for the recipe.","We absolutely loved this recipe! Tastes like something you'd enjoy at an Italian restaurant. It was so simple and so tasty! I added thinly sliced mushrooms and fresh garlic and ""italian style"" diced tomatoes b/c that's what I had. Excellent! Will keep this at top of my list for guests and special dinners.",Excellent. I added artichokes & Italian sausage & a little white wine for the sauce. I didn't have any heavy cream so I just used milk.,"Super! Easy, MUCH faster to put together than I anticipated, and delicious!",Really good and super quick dinner. I prefer it with the addition of pancetta or bacon & sauteed mushrooms. Thanks for sharing the recipe!,"WOW! Amazing! I used extra spinach and cut out the salt! 15 stars- 5 from me, 5 from my boyfriend and 5 from my sis...the 3 of us devoured this! A keeper- thanks =)","I loved this recipe! It tasted like something you would order at a really good Italian restaurant. Although I usually make the recipe as it is written, but I doubled the amount of spinach, and increased the garlic (4 cloves), and used a 20 oz package of refrigerated tortellini (I couldn't find a 16 oz). So delicious and sooo easy! Yummy! :)",This dish was excellent! Easy and quick to prepare. A good meal for very little money. Keep to the recipe and you won't be disappointed!,"This was fantastic. I had some organic cherry tomatoes and mushrooms to use up so I started those first with a diced up chicken breast in some EVOO. I used double the spinach & cheese. Followed the rest of this as directed with the exception of the heavy cream (I only had whole milk). It was fantastic, and really very easy.",Very easy and quick... although I cheated a bit and used leftover jarred alfredo sauce. The proportion of veggies is just right.,,,,,,,,

123,"To be fair, I usually make recipes twice before I rate them as I seriously dislike reviewers who change, then rate the recipe vs making it as written first. Good as written so I am rating this 4 stars for ease, time and ingredients usually on hand. But for my family's preference I made the following modifications. Used spiral noodles in place of egg noodles as they capture more sauce. 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 hot italian sausage which gave the casserole more complexity. Used small pre-sliced pepperoni to save time. Most importantly, this is a great casserole for making ahead ~ as with many pasta dishes, the flavor gets better the longer it sits. Overall this is a great base recipe to build on. Thank you Melissa for sharing!","I love this recipe! My husband loved it and ALL 6 of my kids loved it too! I think it's the first time everyone in the family actually all really liked a casserole I made! It was fun to make too. I didn't change anything about the recipe other than I used pre-sliced pepperoni and cut them into quarters. I will definately be making this recipe again and adding it to my family favorites. Next time, though, I think I will add a layer of mozzarella cheese in the middle and on the top since our family really loves cheese. Thanks so much for a GREAT new recipe!","Your basic recipe is good, but I use Kraft Mac and Cheese, make according to directions. Saute extra-lean ground beef with onion, green bell pepper, garlic. Add two jars Ragu Pizza Quik, and two pkgs sliced Hormel Pepperoni, then bake as directed 350 for about 45 minutes. Yum. Is the most requested recipe by family, and at work. Delicious and easy for kids of all ages. Alison","This was a total HIT at my house! I used penne pasta, chopped up turkey pepperoni, lean ground beef & about 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese. I used an 11 X 7 dish & mixed all the ingredients in the dish instead of the skillet-much easier that way! So easy, so wonderful & will be made over & over again. Thanks so much!","OMG!!!! My daughter (17yo) wanted to make a deepdish pizza so I looked up a recipe off All Recipes. Well, I wouldn't exactly call it 'deepdish pizza' but I would call it fantastic!! The family loved it and it was really hard to save some for my step-son after he gets off work. We added more shredded cheese (we're cheese freaks) and more pepperoni and left off the peppers and onions and had the best pasta/pizza dish ever!!!","I really really liked this recipe. I honestly wasn't expecting much because it looked so simple, but it had a surprisingly complex flavor. I really recommend using the egg noodles, they add a certain something. Also, the pizza sauce is a very critical element, so I would recommend going with a good brand. I used Pastorelli Pizza Sauce and it was very good.",Very easy to make and my husband & kids loved it! Husband said to add mushrooms and more cheese next time. Add whatever pizza toppings you like! Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!,This is very much like crockpot pizza. Same concept as the casserole you just layer the ingredients in a crockpot and place on low for 4 hours or until cheese is melted. I prefer sprial noodles instead of egg noodles for the crockpot they hold better.,"This was very yummy. I didn't have egg noodles, so I substituted penne pasta. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms, since we like them on our pizza. My family gave it a big thumbs up. Thanks!","This was so easy to make! I added the pepperoni in with the hamburg, just to get off a little grease, added a whole jar of mushrooms and left out the onion (personal preferance) I prepared everything the night before and then my daughter threw it in the oven for dinner. Thanks for the yummy and easy post!","Very good! I made a few small changes - whole wheat penne pasta & pizza ingreients we like - pepperoni, hamburger (1 lb.), green pepper, small can of diced olives, 4 oz. of pineapple tidbits. I used pizza cheese blend for the top. Great tasting!","Sorry but I found this recipe very bland. It calls for no salt or seasonings of any sort which I thought odd while making it but I left it alone thinking that perhaps the pepperoni and sauce would add the flavor but not at all. I made it exactly per recipe the first time and was very disappointed after all the good ratings. However, I saw the potential so I made it a second time and sauted veggies separately in olive oil and then added salt, pepper, garlic powder to meat mixture, more sauce and cheese. Included cheddar along with mozzarella and it tasted ALOT better but rating the original recipe.","I really didn't have a whole lot of expectations for this dish, but actually loved it and so did the everyone else. I did read the many reviews about being dry and added a can of plain tomato sauce to the 15oz. pizza sauce, plus some fresh oregano and basil. I followed everything else except...I also added fresh mushrooms and black olives to meat mixture when cooking on the stove top. I used 16oz. mozzarella, and it filled a 10x15 perfectly. I did put half the meat/pasta/sauce mix in the bottom of casserole dish and then covered with a layer of cheese, reserving just a small amount for the top, and finished with the other half of pasta mix, cooked for 20 min as directed and then topped with the rest of moz. and some more pepperoni for looks and cooked for the additional ten min. I did top with some fresh cilantro & blk olives while steaming hot when I took it out of the oven...waited about ten min and cut so perfect. I will make again. Thanks. Everyone ate too much of this one.","We all loved this recipe, I have to admit I did use italian sausage instead of ground beef and also added some Italian seasoning and a little parm. But I think this would have probably been good as is but I don't eat beef so had to make the change. Great recipe Melissa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,"This was really good! I did make a few minor adjustments. The family demanded that I not add the cayenne pepper. I had medium shells instead of penne so I used them. The portobellos I sliced into medium thick strips and I had a jar of roasted red bell peppers that I used instead of fresh. Everyone loved this dish! One thing to note, I have yet to find alfredo sauce that isn't salty so don't add any salt until you've tasted it just before it's ready to plate. Mine didn't need any because the salt in the alfredo sauce was enough. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks to the original poster.",Absolutely easy and fast recipe to prepare that has wonderful flavors. Even better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to marry. Used a combination of red and green bell pepper for additional color and added an additional 1/4 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Thanks Jzeller for submitting this recipe.,"This was a great recipe! I made a few changes only because I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of shrimp I cooked chicken seperately in salt and pepper and then cut into strips and served over the pasta. I used parmesan cheese instead of Romano, and added chopped spinach instead of mushrooms as I don't like mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious! My husband never goes back for seconds, but with this he went back for thirds!","Absolutely delicious. I modified the recipe a little bit (with apologies to the creator!). I cut out the oil entirely. Used 1/2 of the red pepper and onion. Used button mushrooms. Finally, I used fat free half-and-half in place of the cream. This receipe was OUTSTANDING. Hubby and son said it was as good as anything you would get in a restaurant (and I agreed). There wasn't a scrap left!",I made this recipe for my family and we all LOVED it so much!!! We all agree it is worthy of being on a menu at any wonderful Italian (or any) Restaurant! We added scallops to ours and it was DELICIOUS! I hope more people try this recipe. I printed it out and lost it... I looked through about 100 recipes before I finally found it again. (I was looking for fettuccini) THANK GOODNESS I FOUND IT! IT WILL BE TREASURED!,WE loved this recipe. Followed exactly using 1/2 and 1/2 and all e.v.o.o. The baby bellas and sweet red bell added so much to this alfredo mixture. We also used cooked thawed shrimp instead of fresh cause thats what I had. We'll be having this again!!,Why buy alfredo ready made? Its simple to make and tastes better when home made! Now it is a five star.,This was awesome. I made it two weekends in a row. The first for friends so I cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. Had to cook in someone elses kitchen so not perfect (looking!) but yummy. One of my friends made a comment again about it last night. Made it again for hubby tonight. He loved it! Wanted a little firmer mushroom so I used Baby Bello's and still kept the cayenne to 1/2 tsp so as not to overpower the rest of the flavors. Definately a favorite for me!,"One of the top dishes I've ever made, and I've made hundreds. Followed the recipe exactly, except I used whole milk instead of cream. Turned out incredibly delicious.","Awesome recipe!! Shrimp Alfredo with a little kick. Followed the recipe to a T, the whole family loved it.",this was a great recipe. i made it just as it was PERFECT. I CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT POTLUCK SO THAT I CAN MAKE THIS.,"I learned a recipe very much like this one from a friend, so just for the record a good variation is to substitute about 3/4 a cup of tomato sauce for the cream. It makes it into a rose sauce, and really complements the ingredients. For this variation, I would leave out the cayenne, and and button mushrooms would work too.",Perfect!,This is a really great recipe. I added red pepper flakes to the butter when added shrimp. This is one of my most requested dinner recipes. Thanks for sharing.,"This really was a fantastic dish. My family, including the four kids, really liked it. The only thing I did differently was instead of using penne pasta, I used fettuccini. We will definitely be making this a regular in our meal rotation.","This was really good, and the family loved it!!! Only used 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and that was plenty.","I just made this for the first time the other day. It turned out great! Instead of using Shrimp, I grilled some chicken, cut it into slices and laid it ontop of the Penne Alfredo. It was really good. We enjoy a little spice in our food, but my 8 year old thought this was too spicy. So if you are making it for sensitive tastebuds, you might want to omit the cayenne.","This dish is so wonderful and easy. It is such an upgrade from the traditional alfredo. However, if young ones are going to also be enjoying this dish, I would suggest cutting the cayenne pepper down to about 1/2 tsp, otherwise leave it alone if you like a bit of spice. This recipe is a keeper :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,"This is agreat dish! Too inprove the spaghetti squash's tenderness, just put it in a baking dish close to it's size and add 1 1/2 cups of water for the same baking time and it will be wonderfully soft and perfect.","My boyfriend and I had never had spaghetti squash, but as he said, I would give it a 10 star if I could. I am not a fan of squash at all.... but this was so good... All the right blends of veggies. I didnt have fresh basil, used less of the dry basil, also sauted veggies in olive oil , and depending on the size of squash might take longer then 30 mins, i just did the knife test, and knew it needed more time, so added 15 more minutes on.Had a medium size one and well there wasnt any left overs. I had a bowl and bf had the rest, he loved it.. So hats off to the chef who made this a keeper in our house. I also added grated parmesan cheese on top after it was served, yummy we love cheese :) and a loaf of fresh bread to go with it is a meal in it self. This would go great as a side dish for the parmesan tilapia fish , that I also found on here. That too was good. I love to cook and have found so many good recipes on here, this is at the top.... go figure and I thought I hated squash.",I wanted to add a P.S. to my rating. The next day I added some beaten egg and bread crumbs to the leftovers to add substance. I formed the squash into round patties and breaded them with bread crumbs. I then browned them in Canola oil and they were sooooo delicious. My boyfriend loves this recipe and he loved what I did with the leftovers too.,"We love this in our house. But I've modified it a little to better suit our tastes. Firstly I just put some puncture holes in the squash and throw it in the oven whole to bake -- it's much easier to cut when it's cooked and it's just as delicious. I also skip the olives and onion to give it a fresher less complicated taste. Lastly I use grape or cherry tomatoes, they're just nice and managable.","We really liked this new way to enjoy spaghetti squash. I did do some things differently. I microwaved the squash, both halves on a paper plate, skin side for 5 min. and open side covered with paper towel for 6 min. and it was done perfectly. Using suggestions from others, I sauted red pepper and onion together, added one can of Italian style tomatoes, undrained, and ripe olives. Tossed it all together and tried to save enough leftovers for next day lunch :o). It was really super, thanks James.","I enjoyed this dish, but was surprised by the taste/texture of the squash. I read the reviews but for some reason was shocked that the squash 'noodles' were actually crunchy. The taste is pretty neutral, so not offensive. I gave it four stars because I feel that I just need a few more tries to get mentally adjusted to using these instead of real noodles, but once I get adjusted, they are just so much better for you than all those heavy blood sugar spiking real noodles, and makes the homemade garlic bread easy to justify! You don't feel as heavy and bogged down and your meal is 500% healthier.","I had a half of spaghetti squash left over from last night and i can only do the spaghetti squash once in awhile for my DH as he is not a real lover of it. SO to allrecipes I went to look for something to do with the rest. I took all the ideas on the reviews and recreated a cold salad with using similar ingredients. Scraped out the SS and added EVOO, just a couple of dashes, and then diced half a red pepper and 1 tomato and a half cucumber (seeded) Tossed in some scallions cut on the bias and 2 cloves of garlic and about a small can of black olives, salt and pepper, Then about 1/2 cup of feta and some snips of fresh basil from my garden along with some fresh tarragon. Cant wait for dinner! Samples were divine! ps I always punch holes in my spagetti squash and then do in the microwave. Let cool, slice and seed. Will try the cooked version in a cooler season. Thanks James!",DELICIOUS!!!!! Love spaghetti squash but needed new receipe. Easy to make. Used kalamata olives and sauteed the garlic and onion in butter with the olive oil. Tried it also with chopped fresh spinach. Will definitely make again. EXCELLENT!,"I have to give this as low rating even though the recipe is sound. The reason is how to cook the squash. Temperature is wrong and so is the time. First, do NOT cut the squash. Instead, use a long bladed serrated knife to poke holes all over the squash (be careful!). Put the squash in shallow pan (no need to butter or add any liquid) and bake at 375 degrees for ONE HOUR. Remove from the oven and use oven mitts to hold steady with one hand while cutting with the serrated knife. Cut in half then scoop the center seeds/fibrous strands out of each half. Then use a fork to scrape the flesh which yields the spaghetti like noodles. You will be able to see the ""spaghetti-ness"" before starting. The squash is AWESOME. It is very mild in flavor and can be used with any and every sauce/vegetable/meat/etc. It does NOT taste like squash so feel free to go crazy. It is also low calorie, low carb, NO fat (5.5 grams effective (net) carbohydrate plus 2 grams fiber and 30 calories). Perfect for diets or if you just want something delicious and filling. Might even be a great Thanksgiving treat (dinner, dessert or ??)","By far the best and most surprising dish i have made from this site. It's amazing how much the squash tastes like noodles, in fact i prefered it. It was very nice to not feel guilty for eating pasta. I used 2 garlic cloves and left out the olives because I had none in the house. I'm going to make this for my squash hating boyfriend next weekend.","Definately a dish you can be creative with. No fresh basil so used dry basil and added fresh Italian parsley. Oregano or sage would be good too. Used olive oil and a little salt and pepper. Great fall side dish. Can be made ahead. Reheat in microwave then add cheese, olives and herbs.","I am baffled how much some reviewers change a recipe then give it a rating.....they are really rating their own version, not the original! Anyway, this was great just as written. Please don,t skip the feta or substitute Parmesan because the feta adds just the right flavor layer, yum. I have been making spaghetti squash for 35 years, I even grew it in the garden years ago, but this is the best recipe I have ever found--- thank you","We have spaghetti squash often (substitute it for any dish calling for spaghetti pasta) and really love it. So when I found this recipe, with all its blend of vegetables,I just knew this recipe would be colorful and delicious. I normally like Parmesan cheese with spaghetti squash, so feta was something new. We did like this, but I missed the flavor of the Parmesan, and much prefer it over the feta. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil and, of course, salt and freshly ground pepper.","CRUNCHY SQUASH? Note to cooks...if your squash is crunchy, as some people have mentioned, you have not cooked it long enough.","This is a great recipe. My husband absolutely loved it! I'll admit, I did not prepare it as written, I merely used the same concept. Here's what I did: I baked the squash as directed, scooped out the pulp and set aside. In the meantime, I used evoo to saute onion, garlic, zucchini and mushrooms. I seasoned with black pepper, paprika, a touch of salt, a pinch of brown sugar, and sweet basil. I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Next is where I started changing things up. I used a deep glass baking dish and put a layer of the squash down on the bottom, then i covered it with a layer of my tomatoes and veggies, then I covered with a sharp grated parmesan cheese. Then I repeated with the remaining squash and veggies and cheese (imagine you were making a lasagna). I baked on a low heat for about 20 minutes (just waiting for the husband to arrive home for supper). It was delicious!! The cheese melted nicely and it smelled fabulous. A nice addition would be a good crusty bread. I am excited to make this again. I appreciated that it is very flexible. You could vary the veggies considerably and still have a great dish.","If you don't have much time to cook, you can cook the squash in the microwave. Heat whole squash in the microwave for 3 minutes to soften the skin. Cut the squash in half. Place cut sides of squash down on a plate with some water on the bottom. Cover with plastic wrap to keep the moisture in. Heat in microwave for about 8 minutes (depends on the size of the squash). This is a delicious recipe!!!","Very, very good. I did change a few things. As printed on the sticker on the squash, I pierced the squash several times and microwaved it 5-6 minutes and let it rest about 5 minutes before cutting in half. I spread a little butter and sprinkled the inside of each half with some salt, pepper & garlic powder. Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil. I added a little butter, white wine and lemon juice and sauted about 3 cloves of garlic. Then added onions first, later added chopped bell pepper and portobello mushrooms. After a few minutes, added petite chopped tomatoes (canned, drained). Then poured over the ""noodles"" and sprinkled some parmesan cheese (did not have feta) and chopped olives. YUM! I'll try adding some fresh spinach next time.","This was excellent, it made the spaghetti squash taste more like spaghetti and less like squash! After halving the squash, I scooped out the guts (the stringy stuff that smells like pumpkin) with a spoon, scraping until I hit the firm, fleshy part. I did bake the squash for 45 minutes instead of 30, and added a little parmesan cheese to the top of the finished dish. I'll definitely be eating this again - especially because I'm on a diet and pasta is a NO NO! Thanks for the great recipe! P.S. The seeds can be salted and roasted just like pumpkin seeds for a snack.","I really liked the taste of this and will definitely make it again. HOWEVER - the squash did NOT cook in 30 min and I even had the oven higher than 350, it took almost double time. Next time I will save the trouble and cook the squash in the microwave.","I used what I had on hand--a large spaghetti squash bought today at a local farmer's market, 6 ripe homegrown roma tomatoes medium dice, a small zucchini cubed, a bell pepper cut into bitesized pieces, a handful of sliced shiitake mushrooms, 4 cloves garlic diced fine, a small onion out of the garden diced medium, some coarsely chopped oregano, thyme, and parsley (just out of the herb garden)and a generous amount of grated parmesan. To give the squash a little more flavor I diced up a couple of the cloves of garlic and some of the herbs and sprinkled them over the meat of the squash halves before wrapping them in foil (for fear of them drying out too much) and baking them at 350F for 45 minutes. (Ended up putting them back in 10 more minutes for a total of 55 minutes) I used an iron wok for cooking the vegetables. Sauteed the onion and garlic in EVOO and butter, then added the zucchini, mushrooms, a pinch of kosher salt, a little fresh ground black pepper, a few more fresh herbs, and finally the tomatoes. Plated the squash and topped each serving with the sauteed vegetables, grated parmesan cheese, and garnished with a few more fresh herbs.",Tasty!,"Wow-- This is such a good and easy recipe. I poled about 5 wholes in the squash and put it in the microwave for 5 minutes. This made it easier to cut in half. I added 1 1/2 cups of water to a baking dish and baked the squash cut side down for 55 minutes. It was perfect! I also used Kalamata olives instead of black to keep up with the Med. feel. YUM! Just remember that when you first cut it open, you need to clean out all the seeds and stringing stuff, just like a pumpkin. The thick squash you see will actually turn in to the spaghetti.","One word, yuck. I have noticed that a lot of recipes on this website are nasty and people rate them 5 stars. Is everyone eating or the person who submits a recipe rates it like five hundred times.","A satisfying and surprisingly delicious meal! I sometimes add spinach for the extra iron, and almost always add chick peas into this dish for the added protien (and taste!). I have at times used (a lot of) parmesan when I had no feta, and this works. The recipe definitely requires longer cooking of the squash -- I give it an hour. There are usually lots of left overs, as there are only two of us, so I usually I bake them in a casserole dish, and cover the top with grated mixed cheeses. Leftovers can also be added to whole grain pasta & a simple (ie: jarred) tomato sauce.",,,,,,,,,,,,
126,"These were amazing, we cooked them up for Cinco de Mayo, and my fiance won't stop talking about how good they were. I doubled the batch and made a few changes and added: 1/2 t. cumin and 1/2 t. chili powder, a can of diced green chiles, 2/3 c. frozen corn kernels, 8 oz. cream cheese, a can of Rotel diced tomatos and green chiles and upped the garlic to 3 t. I served them with shredded cheddar cheese and they were out of this world. The diced tomatos added moisture--I noticed people had complained about these being too dry. They turned out perfect! This one will be a regular at my house.","This recipe is basically very good, but I only give it 3 stars because I had to change it for my taste. I didn't have the jalapenos so I skipped those. I really don't like cilantro so I left that out. I minced FRESH garlic myself for this recipe, and added chili powder as another reviewer suggested. The black bean, cream cheese, onion and pepper mixture was very attractive and appetizing, but I found it needed quite a bit more salt than called for. I added a little rice to each burrito, to make it more filling, and put a few teaspoons of medium chunky salsa in each as well. I doubled everything in the recipe and made six burritos to freeze for my husband's lunches. With the addition of the rice it would have stretched to about 10 burritos, but I followed another reviewers advice and saved some of the bean mixture for a dip.","All of the reviews are right - these burritos are awesome. The recipe indicates that it makes two big burritos, but they would have to be huge. We usually get four burritos, using regular ""burrito size"" tortillas. The filling reheats well the next day too. Great flavor and excellent source of fiber.","These weren't the best burritos I have ever had, but they were sure good. They froze well and tasted very good. I recommend wrapping them in a damp papertowel when you reheat them in the microwave...they'll come out tasting fresh again.","I doubled the recipe, added a can of green chiles and some cumin. Put the burritos in the oven to melt some cheese on top and then served with salsa on top...yum!!",My boyfriend and I love this recipe! I changed it a little. I boiled and shredded some chiken and added it in at the last minute. It was excellent. I also bought a box of Uncle Ben's Mexican style rice and added some of that into the burrito also. Needless to say it was gone in no time.,"THE BEST!! Cut back on the onions and cilantro a bit, but left everything else as suggested. Seriously the best burritos EVER! Also, you just have to microwave the tortillas for 30 seconds. The oven just kept making them hard and unrollable. FIVE STARS :D!!",Very good. I covered the burritos in pepper jack cheese and baked in the oven for 5 min. They are delicious.,"These made a quick and healthy for me today..and they are quite tasty! I too love black beans, cilanto and cheese and they are great together as a burrito filling. Instead of chopped garlic, I sprinkled in some granulated garlic, (approx 1/2 tsp.) and only used about 1/2 the amount of cream cheese called for. I used refried black beans since that's what I had on hand and added a handful of blended italian cheese since I had some in the fridge. I zapped my tortillas in the microwave...was too lazy to use the oven. I really enjoyed these with a tall glass of diet coke... (i'm sure someone has enjoyed this with a beer or two..hehe). Thanks jessie.","Five stars for this one! It's easy and delicious, and we'll definitely make this again. Satisfying to both vegetarians (me) and omnivores (hubby). The only change that we made was to warm 4 tortillas instead of 2, making 2 smaller burritos for each of us.",Very good...I have learned when it comes to getting the full flavor of cilantro...don't cook it into the food just add it at the end and the heat of the food will be enough to bring that great cilantro taste out.,"Adding the cream cheese to the mix is a great idea, but the recipe, as written, gets four stars from me because it needs some cumin (I added about 2 tsp.) for flavor and it needs some tomatoes for moisture (I chopped up 1/2 of a regular tomato). As others have mentioned, this can be reheated for lunch the next day, and it tastes just as good. Thanks for the recipe!","This was great! I made it as the recipe said, but I thought it was a little too creamy, so I added another can of beans (3 cans for a doubled recipe). I paired it with lime rice, and my favorite burrito add-ons: corn, avacado, and a bit of sour cream. 1 out of 2 kids liked it. Husband & kid used salsa, but I thought it hid the great flavor of the beans. It was surprising how flavorful these beans were. I should add that I am heavy handed with garlic no matter what I am making, so I probably used 5 cloves of medium-small size.",I'll be making this again! I had 2 unexpected dinner guests so I had to add a can of refried beans to the black beans... just to get 4 burritos out of it. Made home made salsa for the top. Wrapped in spinach tortillas with loads of shredded cheese. The whole family plus the 2 extra 16 year old boys LOVED them!,"This recipe exceeded my expectations! Who would've thought that black beans and cream cheese would be a great filling for a burrito. Burritos virgin should give this recipe a try. Quick, easy and delicious. Will make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","Very good- I added a can of chopped green chillies and more salt, and no jalapenos. Also made 4 good sized burritos instead of 2","I omitted the bell pepper and jalapeno--added in a drained can of Ro*tel. I also put in a tsp or so of cumin. This was a tasty side dish, and so versatile it would also work as a dip.","This recipe was good but wasn't excellent. Although, I think it has great potential. TIP: Drain the juices from the can as the recipe states or the texture becomes to mushy/slimy so that was my mistake. I will try this again adding a few of my favorite seasonings to give it a bit more punch. thank you!","I've cooked this 3 times now, each one a little different. First time I followed the recipe exactly but I omitted the jalapenos because I did not have any. Cooked it WITH them the second time. Use them. They make all the difference. I used red bell pepper once and green another. I prefer red. I added corn once, that was good. FRESH cilantro is a must. If you're cooking this for a crowd and you need 2 cans of beans, only rinse and drain one can, I found that if you rinse both it doesn't produce enough moisture. COOK THIS. I am obsessed with this recipe. My father and sister loved it and they are skeptics of vegetarian food. Amazing.",The beans are awesome. Great flavor. I like the idea of putting cream cheese in the beans instead of crisco. YUMO,"These were ok, I think they would have been better without the jalapenos. Based on other reviews, I added a little extra cream cheese, a little bit of sliced black olives, dash of cumin, cayenne, & chili powder, & a can of Rotel. Put the filling in the tortilla & topped with shredded cheese blend, sour cream, taco sauce, & homemade pico de gallo. Yum.","A very good start, but not alot of flavor with this recipe. ""If"" I make this again there are going to have to be some changes to make it more flavorable. Maybe something as easy as adding some fresh salsa, and some spices.","These were amazing! The only things I did differently were I left out the peppers (only because I don't care for them), added white rice, and instead of making two large burritos I used small tortillas to make about 6 small burritos. We topped them with salsa and they were delicious! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!","Delicious, filling twist on the traditional burrito. I loved the red pepper flavor and the cream cheese with black beans. Really excellent with some salsa.","These were awesome. I did follow other users advice and add chilli powder, cumin and frozen corn. Also I decided to top it off with a little sauce (alfredo, pesto and jalapeno juice mix) then top with cheese and bake for about 5 min.","a good starting point, but bland to our taste. We have since added more veggies, hot peppers and spices and it has now become a regular meal.","My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was super easy to make and really good. Since I can't eat dairy, I made half without cream cheese and it was still good (though I have a suspicion that my husband's was better).",,,,,,,,,
127,"I thought this recipe was very good...but I didn't care for all the ingredients needed for the results. It tasted similar to what I tend to do for slow cooker ribs. I simplyt seasoned the ribs with garlic salt, onion powder, and black pepper; place in the crock pot and cover the ribs with a half a bottle of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. I let the ribs cook on low for about 8-10 hours. Then I place them in the oven on a baking sheet for a half hour so that the sauce caramelizes onto the meat. It works every time!","The genius of this recipe is the first step - roasting ribs in the oven. This removes fat and liquid that would otherwise cause soupy results in the crockpot. For this, it deserves 5 stars!! Use any sauce (I like 1 C. ketchup, 1 C. Stubb's barbecue sauce, 2 T. brown sugar, 1 t. Worcestershire, and Tabasco hot sauce to taste.) The original sauce recipe (which I've tried) isn't sharp or hot enough for our tastes. We use boneless beef chuck country ribs, 2 lbs. or more. Stir once during cooking time so ribs don't stick to sides and burn. To thicken sauce a bit, put the crockpot on High, with the lid ajar, during the last half hour. WONDERFUL!","The sauce tastes alot like ketchup. It is not horrible but it is below average. Do not make this recipe because if you read all of the reviews, no one actually made it by the recipe! Everyone changed it to BBQ sauce..so they should not have rated it higher than a star or two. No one hwo made it by recipe liked it. Just slow cook in your favorite bbq sauce, you will be 100% happier! But slow cooking th emeat that long is FABULOUS.","OH MY GOSH--these were the most incredible ribs I have ever tasted, in or out of a restaraunt! I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup, (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. (1 cup) I cut back on the vinegar to 2 1/2 Tbsp. just because I thought 4 Tbsp. was a lot. I also left out the hot sauce, simply because I didn't have any on hand. I used boneless Country Style Ribs. I couldn't get them out of the crock pot in one piece, they were soo tender! Thank you so much for this recipe, it is definitely one of the BEST on this site!!! I would HIGHLY reccommend trying this one! :)",This rib recipe convinced my dinner guest that he needs a slow cooker! I substituted the 2 cup equivalent of my favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup and they were delicious. I would also recommend rotating the ribs halfway through the cooking process if possible so that all the ribs are equally tender. This just became my favorite slow cooker recipe.,"Five stars for the crock pot suggestion. Best prep is simmering ribs in water bath (with minced garlic, seasoned salt & Emeril's southwestern spice), for 20 minutes; then prepare BBQ sauce of choice (approx 2 cups), add to drained ribs and cook in crock pot for 5-6 hours on low. Remove from crock pot and brown ribs on grill or under broiler.","I always get told I make the bestest ribs from soldiers thanks to this recipe! FIRST, do not ignore the baking in the oven first b/c it removed 1/2"" of fat juice in a 9X13 pan!!! THEN, it was hard to decide what sauce to follow since there were a lot of choices suggested, so I went to the most reliable (top rated on the site) called Sylvia's Ribs b/c why ruin perfect ribs?! Basically, dump 2C ketchup, 1C bbq 1C brown sugar, 2.5T lemon juice, 2t Worcestershire, several dashes of hot pepper, 3T steak sauce, cloves garlic ...directly into crockpot. LASTLY, most of the sauces used will be thin in the end, so definitely take out and put in oven at 375 for 20 min to caramelize the sauce onto the ribs (make sure ribs are covered in sauce when you put in oven). These were perfect! You will be a hero if you have a house full of men like me.",This was soooooo good. I substitued half of the ketchup with BBQ sauce and used red wine vinegar and it came out better than ribs at some of the restaurants. My husband is a great ribs fan so will definitely make this again.,"This recipe is great!!! The meat was sooo tender and the sauce was tasty with a good kick but not overwhelmingly spicy. I wouldn't change a thing except up the chili sauce and hot sauce if you're a fan of more heat. And just a note to several of the other reviewers... If you just dumped a bottle of barbeque sauce into the slow cooker instead of following the recipe to at least some degree, you really have no reason to write a review. Trust me, this sauce tastes nothing like KC Masterpiece, all you really did was look at this to find out how long to cook them. Why waste our time with a completely unhelpful review?","This recipe was as good as the other reviews indicated. I implemented the variations suggested by others such as substituting BBQ sauce for half of the ketchup, adding garlic salt, using red wine vinegar and adding a little liquid smoke. Superb!","This was an awesome dish!!! I have recently been to three rib burn-off's and Suzanne's recipe was well worthy of competing! I did, however, add a little bit of garlic powder to the pork before cooking, and I added garlic to the sauce. (By the way, the sauce was PERFECT! No more will I buy BBQ sauce, this recipe blows Open Pitt and KC Masterpiece out of the water!)","This is a very good method of cooking ribs. Like others, i substituted my own BBQ sauce. But I must say something to reviewers who Completely Change the Method: The biggest benefit of using a crock pot is the slow cooking and the easy cleanup! I don't understand why some people suggest to simmer in water, use the crock pot and then cook them again in either stove or grill! Then it becomes a grilling or broiling recipe, that uses a crock pot for one of the steps! I guess i just have a pet peeve when people COMPLETELY change either the cooking method or the recipe and then rate THEIR version! Ok that's off my chest, lol. Enjoy your Ribs everyone!","I find it amusing that some people get so upset when reviewers change or add to the recipe. This is what I enjoy the most - hearing how others tweek the recipe. I've fixed these before and they were so soupy. Now that I've read others remarks, I know why and how to correct it. So, please, all you others, keep on making suggestions and telling how you make a recipe better!","As good as any restaurant! Make these ribs! I very rarely take the time to write a review, but these were so good, I view it as my civic duty to let people know how good this recipe is! The secret to making fall-off-the-bone tender ribs has eluded me for nearly 20 years... until now! The ribs turned out fantastic, truly as good as you can find in any restaurant. I'm not exaggerating! MY MODIFICATIONS: I did what many other people suggested and used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (actually, I used BBQ sauce and some honey), and I used ketchup in place of chili sauce. I also added many dashes of hot sauce (like 15) and a little bit of liquid smoke. Before serving the ribs, I put them on a foil-lined baking sheet, spooned some of the sauce onto them, and baked them at 425 degrees for about 10 minutes per side. I did this to carmelize some of the sauce onto the ribs. Again, these were excellent! The meat came right of the bone as soon as I sank my teeth into it.",Easy to make and clean up. What's not to like about that? Great 'summer meal' that you can make in the dead of winter.,"I used 8 lbs of spareribs for generous servings for 5 people and had enough left over for one extra, which were gone before bedtime, they were so good. I used this recipe for the method, which worked perfectly. I baked them first as listed (I didn't take off the fat lining (?) before, but it wasn't a problem). Then I cut them into serving sizes, coated them with the BBQ sauce- from a bottle, and cooked them on the 8 hr. low setting in the slow cooker.Because I had so many, half way through I took them out and rearranged them so the ones on top went to the bottom to help them cook evenly. Around 7 1/2 hrs, they were done, totally tender, but still on the bone, which I wanted. Then as reviewers advised, I put them on a foil lined cookie sheet, spooned more sauce on them and stuck them under the broiler for 5 mn. They were perfect!!!","I made these ribs in my crockpot this past weekend and my boyfriend LOVED them. I bought county style ribs and first browned them in the oven for about 1/2 hr (15 min. on each side). Then i put them into the crockpot and covered them with the sauce. I used 2 cups of sweet baby rays bbq sauce, i cup of ketchup, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, vinagar, and worcestershire sauce. I let them cook on low for about 7 hours. I then removed the ribs and put them back into the oven to brown for about 10 min so the sauce would stick to the ribs better. They were soooooo tender, the meat literally fell off of the bone when i was removing them from the crockput. I will definitely be making these again!!!!!","I am a pretty good cook; however, I have never made baby back ribs before. I made this last night and it was fabulous! I read the reviews and made the substitutions (BBQ sauce for Ketchup, Ketchup for Chile Sauce as I had none). I followed everything else exactly. Question: If we double the sauce, could we slow cook 2 slabs of ribs at a time ... has anyone tried this? Another comment: DO remove the back membrane, and DO cut them before putting in slow cooker. I cut into 3 sections - next time I will cut into 4 sections.","Great. I did the same as others and used bbq sauce and ketchup. I also seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and a little paprika. I did the 15 minutes on each side in the oven at 350. I put them in the slow cooker, poured the mixture and cooked for 6 1/2 hours. I took them out and placed them on an aluminum pan, poured the sauce on top and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes at 300 which gave them an opportunity to carmelize. SIMPLY DELICIOUS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

129,"I have been making this recipe for years but not in a skillet. Brown your chops (butterfly chops are the best, No bone) with seasoning. In a 9x13 pan pour in your Cream of mushroom soup OR golden mushroom soup with 1/2 can of milk. Bake @ 350 for 1 hour & cover with foil. MMMmmm good! The easiest & most tender chops around. Serve with potatoes & use the gravy.","I only gave this four stars as it is, but when I changed it a bit it was fantastic. When I make this now, I brown the chops really well and then I de-glaze the pan with a bit of white wine. after the alcohol cooks off a bit I lower the temp and add some minced fresh garlic, a pinch of thyme, the soup, the fresh mushrooms and put the chops back in. Comes out fantastic every time.","This is a great recipe. I poured a little olive oil in the pan and sauteed a clove of garlic before placing the salted chops in the pan. Once they were brown, I removed them & sauteed the onion & mushrooms. While those were cooking I whisked about a half cup of dry white wine & a half cup of milk in with the mushroom soup and added a tablespoon of fresh tarragon & some fresh ground pepper. I returned the chops to the pan & poured the sauce over them. I covered them & simmered for about 30 minutes. There was pleanty of yummy mushroom sauce to pour over the chops & the rice. This would be good with potatoes, too. This is a recipe that when served looks like it took hours to make, but is really very easy.","I also use the golden mushroom soup for this recipe. For a one dish meal, I just put the pork chops in a 9x13 dish, pour in all the ingredients, add potatoes and cover tightly with foil bake at 350 for about 40-45 minutes. Big Hit at my house and really easy when you don't want to cook...which is pretty much every evening.","My husband loved this! I did make some changes based on reviews. I tenderized the chops, rubbed in seasonings & browned them in a skillet with oil. I sauteed onions w/ fresh garlic & then added them to the chops. I increased the soup to 2 cans & added white wine & milk (I really felt that gave it more flavor, thank you to the reviewer who recommended that!) I poured it over & also added fresh mushrooms (I didn't saute them simply because my husband brought them home with him). They turned out really well...I simmered it for a good 30-40 minutes. I made mashed potatoes with it, and used the leftover mushrooms and onion to saute with some green beans and garlic. The only thing I may try next time is a marinade before browning the chops to give them even more flavor. I gave it a 5 because it's a wonderful base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking, I'm not sure if I would have liked it as much without the changes, though. Great meal idea, super easy and adaptable, thank you! :)","Simply delicious! I would give it a higher rating if it were possible.I also used fresh garlic,2 cans of soup and 1/2 can of milk, as someone else suggested.Didn't brown chops,just dumped everything into baking pan and cooked,covered, at 350 for about 1-1/2 hrs.Meat was very tender.Gravy was great,served over noodles.Hubby & son loved it.","This recipe tempted me based on the few ingredients and time to prepare/cook. As written, it was okay, not great, not bad! Definitely lacking something.... hmmmm! Probably will not make again without adding seasonings, so as written, only 3 stars.",Absolutely delicious!! After the pork chops were browned I removed them from the pan and sautéed the onion and mushroom with some fresh garlic. When the onion was tender I added some red wine (pinot noir) to de-glaze the pan then put the chops back in and added the soup mixed with a bit of milk. This recipe was very easy and everyone in my family loved it.,"I have made these pork chops for 30 or more years, and at first did this exact recipe. However through the years I have tweaked it to my families liking and have found my families favorite way. I brown the chops as stated here with a simple salt and pepper start. After browning the meat, I remove it and place in a casserole pan. I add the onions (lightly salt and pepper them too) into the fry pan with the meat's leftover grease and cook until they are translucent, add the mushrooms and cook another 6-8 minutes or so, I then add 2 cloves minced garlic and continue to cook about 30-45 seconds. I then remove all of the veggies from the pan and put on top of the chops. Then deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup white wine. Be sure to scrape all the bits of brown from the bottom of the pan. I then add the can of mushroom soup and add the milk -cream- or half&half, whatever you have, and mix with a whisk until reheated again. I then add some ground or fresh rosemary and thyme to the sauce and mix well again, then pour over the veggies and meat. I sprinkle with a bit of Paprika, cover with foil and place in a 350 oven for about 1/2 hour. I then remove the foil and cook another 15 min, remove from oven and serve with some creamy mashed potatoes. YUMMMMM-O! So tender and good you'll wish you made double!","Excellent with a few changes. Mixed 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup white wine with soup, poured over browned chop mixture, and baked in oven for one hour covered. Moist, tender chops with to die for gravy.","Awesome...I'll make this recipe again. First I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning, browned the chops in olive oil and butter. I don't like canned mushrooms so I used Shitake mushrooms and I sliced the onions in rings, then cut them in half so the onions were larger slices rather than chopped. I used two cans of mushroom soup and mixed about a cup of white wine with the soup before adding it to the chops. I found that I needed to cook this longer than what's called for in the recipe, I cooked for a full hour and the chops were VERY tender. Served with white rice, fabulous !!","This recipe was really delicious, and my father raved it was the ""best pork chop recipe he'd ever tasted."" It was fairly easy, although chopping up the onion and mushroom can take a few minutes. I made this for six pork chops. While doing so, I omitted: - garlic salt And added: - 4 cloves chopped garlic - 1/4 cup red wine - 1 can lowfat cream of celery soup - Flour (before serving) to firm up gravy I added the red wine after sauteeing the onions, mushrooms, and garlic in a bit of olive oil. I let that simmer for a few minutes before adding the soups. Because I was waiting on my brother to get home from work, the pork chops simmered a bit longer than the recipe suggests. At at the low temperature, though, I didn't have any problems. It turned out fabulous!","Make it in one step - throw it all in a crock pot! Just use one can of soup, season to taste, and cook on low 4-6 hours. This was the very first home-cooked meal I made my husband in college, and I'm still using it 20 years later.","After reading a few reviews, I decided to follow Jennifer's. It was DELICIOUS! My husband said ""You outdid yourself!"". Here are Jennifer's changes: This is a great recipe. I poured a little olive oil in the pan and sauteed a clove of garlic before placing the salted chops in the pan. Once they were brown, I removed them & sauteed the onion & mushrooms. While those were cooking I whisked about a half cup of dry white wine & a half cup of milk in with the mushroom soup and added a tablespoon of fresh tarragon & some fresh ground pepper. I returned the chops to the pan & poured the sauce over them. I covered them & simmered for about 30 minutes. There was planty of yummy mushroom sauce to pour over the chops & the rice.",This is excellent ! I add a big spoonful of sour cream into the gravy the last 10 minutes you have to try that! Makes the gravy so much better!,"Yummy! First I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in EVOO, then added my salt and pepper coated chops. After they browned I added in the mushroom, onion and cream of mushroom soup. I also added a few tablespoons of milk to thin it out. Set to med-low for 35 min (covered). Turned out AMAZING. The sauce was rich and had a very creamy taste. I think the garlic was key :)","I finally found the recipe that produces tender pork chops! I've made this in the crockpot too, and really liked the results. I poured two cans of cream of mushroom soup in the crockpot, put the chops on top, added the mushrooms and chopped onion which I'd sauteed in a little olive oil, then topped everything with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I started these in the morning (about 10am) on low heat and they were perfect for dinner at 6pm. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!","This recipe was a breeze and super delicious! As others had noted, I made a few changes as well. I seasoned and browned the chops in a bit of olive oil in my skillet, then removed them and popped them into a 9x13 pan in 375 oven. In my hot skillet, I added two minced cloves of garlic, one medium onion chopped, and the mushrooms. I deglazed the pan with 1/2cup veg stock and finally added the soup. Once all hot and bubbling together and onions were tender, I poured this over the pork chops and returned to oven until cooked through. These were great!",This is an excellent recipe. I passed it on to my son and he loves it also. I added 1/2 can of milk so as to have more gravy. I also substituted a jar of whole mushrooms for the fresh. Tonight I will be making it again. This time I am using sliced Pork Loin. Thanks you.,this recipe is awesome! it remind me of being a kid. my mom used to make this but couldn't remember how to make until now! my whole family loves it!!! when you add just a touch of balsamic vinegar at the time of mushroom soup. it makes it even more yummy if that is possible :),always make it in the over..,"I did not salt the pork chops because the garlic salt was plenty. I actually laid the pork chops in my slow cooker, spreading the onion and mushrooms over the top of that. I did add a half cup of fat free evaporated milk because I wanted a thinner gravy. My family thought this was good. I served the chops with buttered egg noodles to soak up the gravy with garlic green beans on the side. There was enough for three dinners and a lunch for my husband tomorrow.","Artzbet...15 Jan., 2011 to ans your question about pork chops getting too dry. A couple things. When the instuctions say bake 20 to 30 min always choose the least amount of cooking time. Our Publix super makket here in Tallahasse offers weekly cooking classes for its customers. This subjuect came up to one of the Chefs recently. His comment was, ""if you think they are done you have waited too long""! You don't have to worry about getting sick from under cooked pork like our mothers and grandmothers used to have to do. Triganosis has been eliminated as a hazard due to new prep and feeding methods of pigs.","this was a delicious meal but i did some things different to make it this way. first i seasoned & browned the boneless chops in olive oil for just a couple minutes then removed them & placed in a 9x13 baking pan then i added the mushrooms, onions and a couple tbs minced garlice & sauteed til the onions were tender then added cream of mushroom soup with a couple dashes of worsteshire sauce then placed in the oven at 375 for about 25 minutes. it was delicious, served with a side of veggies.","Fabulous! So easy. Will be a staple in our house! Seared the butterfly chops in our cast iron then deglazed the pan with 1/8 cup of beef broth, added the mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of milk and simmered for 30 minutes. Served over brown rice and a side of steamed veggies.","just like some previous users, i browned the pork chops first, took them off, sautteed the onions and mushrooms, then put all that with 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of white wine, and condensed cream of mushroom and it came out amazing!!!!!!","Yummers! I followed the advice of the other review's and used two cans of mushroom soup. I also browned the pork chops in the olive oil, 3 minutes on each side, then and additional three minutes for both sides. While the meat was browning I mixed the two cans of soup, a half a cup of sour cream and thre tablespoons of grated parm cheese in a bowl. Once the meat was done I deglazed the pan, add sauteed fresh mushrooms, red onion, and four cloves of fresh minced garlic until soft. Returned the meat to the pan and poured the mixture over the chops. Covered and cooked on the stovetop for 25 mins, stirring often. The pork chops were sooo tender. This is a keeper, will make again!",,,,,,,,,
130,"Although I've been using allrecipes for over 10 years, I've never found a recipe that I've enjoyed so much that I would join just to rate it, until now! I am 50 plus years old and have been addicted to stuffed cabbage and peppers for most of my life. I have tried hundreds of different recipes. NONE have even come close to this one! My search for the perfect stuffed cabbage or pepper is over! I will never use another recipe. I'm actually getting ready at this very moment to use the filling minus the rice to make homemade ravioli. Thank You Chef John for such a PHENOMINAL RECIPE!","When I asked my boyfriend what types of things he likes to eat are, after much prodding, the only thing he named was Stuffed Peppers, noting that his mother makes them often. Later, he said ""why don't we just go eat them at my moms?"" Clearly - mom had some good stuffed peppers. Last night I took a stab at making Stuffed Peppers for the first time ever, for my boyfriend, and used this recipe. I halved the recipe, and halved 2 large peppers and filled them that way, to make for easier leftover servings. As I prepared them, my boyfriend stood over me, smirking... and said ""your way is a little different."" I could see he was skeptical!! Presentation wise, these peppers looked the part. Beautiful. We sat and ate, and for the first few minutes, didn't speak. I was getting nervous... I don't think he likes them. Half way through my plate, he quietly says ""These aren't like my moms."" I said ""sorry babe..."" and before I could finish he exclaimed ""THEY""RE BETTER!!!! THEY ARE SO FREAKIN GOOD!"" And they were!! As I sit here writing my first review, I'm eating the leftovers. YUM!! The only thing, and this may be because I eyeballed halving the recipe, is I wish I made more sauce. It was delicious and we poured some on extra rice on the side, but there wasn't a lot left for the leftovers. It was so delicious I'd want extra sauce to pour ridiculous amounts of! YUM!! May be different if you do the full recipe, or maybe worth doubling the sauce, or 1 and a half.",Best stuffed peppers I've ever had. I followed the recipe almost exactly - I didn't have beef broth so I just used water and it was still delicious. Thanks!,"We made a double recipe of this, using 8 bell peppers (16 halves). The servings are very generous. I followed the recipe pretty well though I did use less of the cheese as I didn't feel like opening another bag. It got rave reviews from everyone. I loved it, my husband loved it, and the kids loved it. The green peppers and bright red sauce make for pretty contrast, and the savory flavor is wonderful. We had quite a lot left over and the leftovers taste just as good. I would highly recommend making a huge batch, and freezing some. It's cheaper and tastes better than the boxed frozen stuffed peppers.","Probably the best peppers I have EVER eaten! They were fantastic! I did change it up just a bit because of what I had on hand. I had a 2 pound package of 93% fat free ground beef, so I skipped the sausage. To mock a spicy sausage flavor, I added some fennel seed, pepper flakes and ground sage to the meat. I used brown rice instead of white rice. For the diced tomatoes I used rotel style tomatoes and drained them. I didn't have any parmesan cheese so what was I going to do? Light bulb moment... those pizza parmesan packets they give you when you order pizza! I have a ton of them so I added about 12 packets of that to the meat. I didn't add the cheese on top until the last 20 minutes and I ended up using mozzarella on top. Served it with some whole grain spaghetti that was tossed with onion, garlic and pepper. TOTALLY delish! I am SO full and I am fighting the urge to go munch on more... the sauce was great too!","I made half of the filling mixture for this recipe and it was plenty for three smallish green peppers (6 halves). I prepared these early in the day, covered and refrigerated them. I omitted the pork sausage and used fresh tomatoes. The recipe is confusing because it instructs you to stir the rice and parmesan into the meat mixture. Then later instructs you to sprinkle the remaining parmesan (what remaining parmesan?) over the top. So not knowing how much to put where, I just winged it and used 2 T. in the meat mixture and sprinkled more on top after baking. I baked these covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15 more minutes and my peppers were still crisp tender. I wouldn’t have wanted to bake them any longer. This was good and the hint of balsamic vinegar was a nice addition.","I don't think I ever knew real stuffed pepper love until I met these. Wow. Other than using red bell peppers I didn't change a thing. Confusion over when to add the cheese, in the mixture or as a topping, or 1/2 and 1/2. I added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there. It would've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a LOT of stuffing, so much I piled it as high as I could on each pepper. Not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me, but I think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given. Spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier. If you think is good the first night, it's double WOW reheated the next day.","Yes I tire it, and it was a big disappointment! After one bite, my wife wouldn't eat it and I ate some only because I spent 2 hours making it! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using red bell peppers instead of green peppers.","I thought this recipe was great. My family was only so-so about it but they don't care for stuffed peppers at all. The only complaint I have about the recipe is that made as is, you have way too much filling or not enough peppers. I used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over. I even over over stuffed mine and had extra. I could have easily stuffed 3-4 more peppers with the filling. I just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce. Thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper!",These are truly the best stuffed peppers I have ever eaten! I made them twice in one week because we couldn't get enough of them.,"The BEST stuffed peppers I have ever eaten! And I was really counting on it, because I used two large, beautiful bell peppers from my garden ... the biggest I grew this summer, and I wanted them to be memorable. Chef John's recipe did not disappoint. These were far better than the ones I remember my Mom making with tomato soup (that I never cared for). These babies were the bomb. I cut the recipe in half because I only had the two peppers, and just my husband and myself to feed. The leftovers, taken on a camping trip and reheated, were awesome too. Five Star Stuffed (homegrown) Peppers, eaten at a picnic table overlooking the McKenzie River ... beat that, gourmet restaurants!","Chef John does it again! I have never made stuffed peppers before, but now I am going to be making these frequently! This recipe is SO tasty! I used whole peppers with the top third cut off. Make sure you really pack the meat/rice mixture into the peppers. This makes it more solid and easier to eat. If you don't they will fall apart when you cut them open to eat. This recipe makes way more meat/rice mixture than you will need, so plan accordingly. UPDATE: You can easily make these healthier by substituting extra lean ground beef (I used 4% fat), turkey hot Italian sausage and brown rice. They still turn out yummy and added bonus: healthy!","These are delicious! The best stuffed peppers I've ever tasted and that's saying a lot. The sauce is really good and I don't normally like tomato sauces. You must try these. I didn't have the sausage on hand so I used all ground beef, but followed the recipe exactly. I'll be making these a lot from now on.","this was my favorite stuffed pepper recipe so far, even with substitutions. I used 1.3lbs ground turkey instead of ground beef and omitted the sausage (because I didn't have time to defrost the sausage I had). It was plenty of stuffing, though my peppers were pretty small. Didn't use beef broth, instead added 3/4 cup of the juice I drained from the diced tomatoes. Peppers were cooked perfectly not too hard or soft. Loved the tomato sauce mixture for dipping. Next time I will try adding the sausage, I think that would take it to another level! Also, 8 pepper halves do not fit in 1- 9x13, you'll need another small 8x8 to fit all your peppers in.","Wow, these were good! I didn't have the hot Italian sausage on hand. What I did have was an 8oz package of Bob Evans breakfast sausage. I mixed that up with my ground beef and other ingridients. I also used more than four peppers so I kept them whole instead of slicing them in half. After they baked I topped them with Sharp Vermont white cheddar. Sooo good. This is the first time I didn't brown my meat before stuffing the peppers. They turned out delicious! Will make them again!","I use this recipe to stuff TONS of peppers and save them in the freezer, during harvest season. They are absolutely wonderful and I can't wait til a cold winter day when I don't wanna cook. The only thing I changed was a little more sausage! Great flavor.",Sooo delicious!!! I had to use mild Italian sausage since my local supermarket was out of hot (GASP). Definitely making again!!,"Excellent. My Italian husband said it was the best stuffed peppers he has ever had! I did make some changes: I parboiled the peppers, omitted the sausage, and used leftover homemade marinara for the sauce. The only thing I would change for next time would be to cut the salt in half. One teaspoon is enough as it was slightly too salty. But I will definitely be making this again.",My first attempt at making stuffed peppers and I have to say they were some of the best stuffed peppers I have ever had. I used red bell peppers and didn't have beef broth so substitued white wine. We ate them as left overs for several days and they microwaved just fine. I had a lot of stuffing left over so froze it and will have an easy weeknight recipe next time around.,"I served these to company and we all really liked this dish. I followed the recipe as closely as possible and it made just enough stuffing for 6 medium peppers. I had to substitute the cheese as I couldn't find Parmigiano-Reggiano so I used an Italian 5 cheese blend, and I used dried parsley. We had 2 peppers leftover and they were even better the next night. I will definitely make them again, but next time I will boil the peppers first, only because we like them a little softer, and I'll make sure I have the right cheese and parsley on hand. I will also make them a day ahead and will use more cheese, again our preference. I will start looking for recipes by Chef John - this was great!",Excellent! 'Nuff said.,"Best stuffed peppers I've ever had; and my family agreed! Used chorizo instead of italian sausage - very tasty! But this recipe took alot longer to make than the directions stated. My advice - mix what you can ahead of time! If the meat were even mixed up the night before - it would ""season"" well and still be delicious. This recipe also makes a ton of stuffing. I had four very large bell peppers (don't just try green!) and we had them stuffed very full plus huge mounds leftover! Yum yum yum!","Love this! I cut the recipe in half, used whole grain brown rice (no one could tell) and tossed in a few diced mushrooms with the meat. I tossed a few bread crumbs on top of the stuffed peppers with the cheese before baking. Absolutely the best stuffed peppers I've ever had...","This is the best stuffed pepper recipe that I have ever had. If you follow the recipe exactly, which I did, it does make a lot of stuffing but I froze the stuffing and then thawed it at a later time when I had more peppers. (Great way to cut down on the time and effort when making them again.). When I made the sauce (before i cooked it with the peppers), I was a little concerned since it tasted different than the sauce I was used to having with stuffed peppers but, once the peppers were cooked with the sauce,WOW, was it good. The flavors blended nicely. Leftovers were fantastic too. One note is that I did used red, yellow and orange bell peppers since that's what I had available but I did follow the recipe exactly for the stuffing and sauce. Thanks chef!","I made this last night and it was fantastic. I've never loved stuffed peppers because I find they can be very bland. These were spicy. Not like burn your mouth spicy but flavor enhancing spicy. Next time I make these I will add more spicy sausage. Other than that the only thing I changed was I added a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the sauce.",Very tasty! full of flavor.,"The time it took and multiple steps before even stuffing the peppers was way too long, a lot of work and the clean up with all the bowls, chopping boards, pots and pans was no party either. I was worried about the Cayenne and Pepper Flakes because of the kids so I went VERY easy on them. When they were done and I tasted a bite, I immediately had a rush of the heat in them. I would never serve to kids. I don't think you need either or the name needs to be changed to something like hot and spicy. If you are good at something you know just stick with it and don't try and get fancy. I learned my lesson and will make my usual next time. For me, nothing special about the taste of this recipe (other than the heat). Save your time and $$$ and stick to your own or one that is much more simple. Thank you for sharing and I'm sorry for being a downer but I read reviews and go by them as I'm sure others do as well. I just wanted to be honest.",,,,,,,,,

133,"These ribs really did fall off the bone and they were delicious!! However, I would change a couple things next time I make them. I followed the recipe as is, except I made my own bbq sauce. When they were in the oven, the foil pouches started leaking. I contributed that to the fact that I may have had too much sauce in there and also the ribs secrete their own juices as they cook. Next time I may cook them in a cooking bag or I might line a 13x9 baking pan with non-stick foil and marinade and bake them in that. The non-stick foil really works! I baked the ribs for 2 1/4 hours and then placed them meaty side up on a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil. Then I put more homemade sauce on them and broiled them for 15 minutes. This really makes a difference because then the ribs have sauce really sticking to them, restaurant style. If you skip this part and just take the ribs out of the foil and serve them, there is no sauce on them and they look pale and unappetizing. Just be sure to check the ribs frequently as their broiling so that they don't get burned. I had 3 big, hungry guys for dinner that night and they ate 5 pounds of ribs! Just a side note, I made yummy potatoes in foil and the whole dinner was EASY cleanup! Just slice raw potatoes fairly thin and lay them in a mound on a lg. piece of foil. Put a few pats of butter on them and sprinkle with salt, pepper or any herbs you like. Seal them up good and let them cook with the ribs for at least an hour and","This basic recipe, or cooking method, when combined with the suggestions of others, allowed me to make the most delicious, and easiest ribs we've ever had! Here are my changes. I adapted the ""Dry Rub for Ribs"" by Denise from this site, and it was the perfect amount for the three racks of ribs I had. This is what I used: 1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper. (Definitely remove the back membrane before rubbing spices on! Several people had mentioned how runny the barbecue sauce got from the meat juices, so I put only the dry rub on for the 8 hour marinating process, as well as the baking. My second concern was about the meat literally falling off the bones. I wanted to finish them on the grill, so meat actually falling off bones wasn't desirable. I baked the foil packets on cookie sheets at 300 for 2 hours. I let them cool for about 1/ hour to firm up before I moved them to the grill. Then I brushed them with Jack Daniel's sauce thinned with a little of the cooking juices. Finally, I grilled them on medium heat, brushing with extra sauce for about 5 min. a side, till they were nicely caramelized. YUM! They were ""falling off the bone"" tender, without actually falling off. Try these! You won't be sorry!","First an editorial comment: someone ripped this recipe because all it involved was a method to cook the ribs, while using common bottled dressing. I must disagree. There are a lot of ways to screw up a rack of ribs, especially for the novice. This lets you use your favorite sauce, which in my case was Sweet Baby Ray's, so there's no experimenting with something you ultimately won't like. Just as promised, the ribs cooked to a perfect doneness. I'll echo what others have said: it's best to brown them under the broiler afterwards. I drained them, placed them on a broiler pan, swabbed on more sauce, and broiled them for a few minutes. Absolutely perfect. UPDATE: Use the fantastic rub described in Cathy M.'s review before brushing on the sauce. It makes these ribs even better. Also, before anything, remove the membrane on the back of the ribs by slitting with a knife, grip the membrane with a paper towel, and pull. It will rip right off.","I've gotta start off by saying I was skeptical before I started with all of the claims saying the meat just fell off the bone. I thought about having ribs for dinner at 3:00 pm. So I defrosted them and knew I had seen a recipe on here for them before. I thought about doing the overnight bit but I would be the only one home tomorrow night so I went ahead with it. I dusted the ribs with a rub of sugar, salt, pepper and paprika and then poured some Billy Bones BBQ sauce right on the foil,put the rib meat side down on the foil and then poured more sauce on top and bundled it up. These were wonderful. I could just pull the bone right out and was left with a boneless piece of pork if I wanted to. I will definitely make these again and will marinate them overnight as the recipe says. But they're still great if you make them the same afternoon without any time to marinate.","This method was excellent -- and inspired me to come up with something even better. At the minimum, you can follow this method as is, except lower the oven temperature to 225 degrees and bake for four hours. For even better results, coat the ribs with prepared mustard (the taste of which will disappear during the long cooking time) and apply a ""dry rub"" (you can find many recipes for rubs on the Internet or in barbecue cookbooks). Seal the ribs in a plastic bag and refrigerate for at least one day; I do it for three days. Put the ribs on a raised rack or on paper towels (to allow fat to drip off or to absorb fat). Put the ribs and rack (or towels) in an oven bag and bake at 225 degrees for four hours. (Don't worry, paper towels will not burn at such a low temperature.) After four hours, the ribs will have a nice crust and flavor from the rub and will be fall-off-the-bone tender. The last step is to remove the ribs from the bag, brush the upper surface with your favorite barbecue sauce and broil for ten minutes. This is optional, but after cutting up the ribs, I like to pour on a little more sauce to make the ribs ""wet."" I realize that this written description makes the process sound quite involved, but it's really not and the results are well worth the extra trouble. Oh, and I have really enjoyed experimenting with different rub/sauce combinations.",I'm a last minute recipe finder and didn't have but 30 minutes to prepare for cooking - so I didn't marinate these ribs in the sauce for more than 20 minutes and they were AMAZING - I did omit the spraying of the foil and used the new Reynolds Non-Stick Foil instead no sticking - and no mess! Grilling for 20 minutes after baking - on indirect medium heat makes them restaurant style.,"Yes, these are great IF you add to it. First, definitely use a dry rub before cooking in the oven. I also add a slight amount of brown sugar to caramelize and add great color. Finally after removing from oven, remove foil and grill for about 10 minutes on each side, basting with bbq sauce,until desired color. The grilling at the end is the key to not having a ""McRib"" texture. Try it...YUM!!!","These ribs really got my guests' attention when they literally fell off the bone, as they were served! I ensured their tenderness by removing the tough, clear membrane from the underside of the ribs. Then I lightly seasoned the underside with a rub, and used the Blackberry BBQ Sauce recipe (from this site) for the top of the ribs. As the recipe said, they were marinated overnight, then slow cooked in foil. Fantastic! The three elements for tender ribs: (1)remove the membrane prior to cooking; (2)marinade with a lemon or vinegar acidic base (found in the ketchup in this recipe); (3)slow cook... voila! perfect ribs every time! Thanks for sharing the recipe.","If it falls off the bone, you just steamed all the texture and flavor out of them. Try using a dry rub instead of the sauce, cut the oven time back to a couple hours, low temp 250, then slowly grill over charcoal. Add sauce at the end. You'll have a better slab with a little bite to the meat.",Great recipe for 'winter' bbq. Clean-up was so incredibly easy! Before baking I rubbed 'Jim Goode's BBQ Beef Rub' (I find this recipe at Allrecipes too) on the ribs for an extra punch.,"As per Todd Wilbur's method (Top Secret Recipes) copy catting Tony Roma's ribs, I've made ribs exactly this way for years--so good I wouldn't do it any other way, let alone the hard way! Once out of the oven, finish them off on a charcoal grill for a few minutes, brushed with a little extra BBQ sauce and you're in hog heaven.","For those of you making ribs for the first time, you do NOT always have to remove the membrane from the ribs before cooking. If you forgot to do this, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. My father makes the most tender ribs I have ever tasted, and he never removes the membrane. The ribs are so tender, you won't even know its there. What my father does differently is that he marinates this recipe overnight. He cooks it on 250 degrees F for about 4 and-a-half to 5 hours, and they are KICK BUTT. Also, if you don't have a broiler, no worries. When your ribs are done cooking, remove them from the oven and smear them with more BBQ sauce, then put the ribs back into the oven for 5-10 minutes. They taste just as good.","Fantastic recipe! I pulled the membrane off the ribs, used the dry rub from Cathy M's review (1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper), and put them on a baking sheet covered very tightly with foil for 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees. They were falling off the bone when I removed them from the oven. Then, I cut them into serving sized pieces, put them on the BBQ using a mixture of the cooking juices and Famous Dave's BBQ sauce. I grilled them for about 10 minutes to lightly brown and caramelize the sauce. Finger licking good!","This recipe never fails! I have made these ribs 4 or 5 times now, and they're always fantastic. I messed up last time and cooked at 350 degrees for 2 hours, and they *still* came out great, just a tiny bit drier than usual. To help prevent leaks, I use a double layer of foil to wrap the ribs in, and line the cooking sheet with foil to catch any juices that do come out. After the 2 hours in the oven, I take the ribs out of the foil, brush liberally with more sauce, and broil for another 10 minutes or so. This step makes a HUGE difference. The meat is flavourful anyway, but with the added sauce and broiling, you get the sticky, glazed goodness that comes with restaurant-style ribs. Plus, you can reserve the rib juice from the foil packets to use as a gravy or stew flavouring. It's the recipe that keeps on giving! Thanks Ken!!","This is the next best thing to grilled ribs. The second time I did it, I chopped up onions and fresh garlic and tossed it right along inside with the meat and it was even better!!! To get rid of the watered down flavor, open the packet, flip your oven to broil and keep basting the last 30 minutes of cooking time.","This recipe was the easiest and best tasting for baby back ribs. I always used to have tough ribs and the old method of boiling them and grilling them always lacked for more. I'm so glad I found this recipe, this will be my go-to method from now on. I cooked 4 racks of ribs, using the Farmer John's brand purchased from Smart & Final. The key to tender juicy ribs, I found, is that you have to remember to remove the membrane on the back of the ribs. If you've ever experienced ""tough"" ribs, then it's because the membrane wasn't removed. This made a huge difference. I cooked all 4 racks of ribs in my oven on the lower and top racks, alternating racks an hour and a half into the cooking time. I also upped the temperature the last hour and a half to 325, then 350 the last half hour to compensate for the extra meat in the oven. The result? perfect ribs. I also used the dry rub found on this site by Denise. Rub the ribs with the dry rub, and then liberally basted with KC masterpiece bbq sauce before sealing with foil. When the ribs were done cooking, I brushed with more bbq sauce and broiled the racks for 10 minutes to give them that charred, sticky good flavor and look. The ribs received raves from my dinner guests. Absolutely moist, juicy, fall of the bones. Yummy!",I made these on a Friday night and again on Sunday night because they were so good. We have an inground pool and our house is party central in the summer so I'm always looking for great grilling recipes. Our guests were freaking out over how great these ribs were. I had numerous people say they were the best ribs they ever had. I was previously making my baby back ribs with the Prize winning ribs recipe from this website but there is NO comparison. These ribs fall right off the bone. They are tender and absolutely delicious. I baked them in the oven in the aluminum foil tents (I used Sweet Baby Rays honey bbq sauce) and then grilled them on high for 2-3 minutes a side so they had nice charcoal grill marks on them. These also taste GREAT with the Blackberry BBQ sauce from this website. Thank you so much for this recipe. This is the ONLY way I will ever make ribs on the grill this summer or ever again!!!,"Perfection! I too used Cathy M's dry rub first: 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp Paprika , 1 Tbsp Kosher Salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp Black Pepper, 1 tsp Garlic powder, 1 tsp Onion powder, 1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper. Remove the membrane (A MUST). Use a paper towel to grip the membrane. While marinating in fridge, my foil bags also filled up w/ liquid (small mess), now I place foil bags in a large plastic bag. I drained the bags prior to the oven. I lined my oven w/ foil as the foil bags do get full of liquid but the lipped baking sheet they are on took care of any spills. Baked 2 hours at 300 in foil bags, cool for 20 min, then 15 min on BBQ or broiler. Don't bake any longer or they fall off the bone and you cannot place them on BBQ or broiler. My ribs did not look pale and therefore did not need the BBQ, but I did it anyway. And remember to use non-stick foil or just spray w/ oil like I did.","Sooo good...followed Cathy M's suggestion for dry rub - this is what she uses: 1/4c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. paprika, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 Tbsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne red pepper. I liberally coated the ribs with the dry rub in the morning and refrigerated them tightly in foil. It's really hot here in California, so I waited until the weather cooled down at night and baked them (in the foil) on a cooling rack placed on a cookie sheet so the heat could circulate around the ribs. Baked at 250 degrees for four hours with just the dry rub. After cooling down, back into the refrigerator. The following day I took them out of the refrigerator for about an hour to take the chill off, then swabbed on some good BBQ sauce and put them on the barbie for 15 mins total on gas grill - direct heat for 5 minutes and indirect heat for 10 minutes remaining. Hubby said ""you can't get them this good anywhere else"". Thank you for a great recipe.","I made these ribs for dinner tonight and they were wonderful! I have tried several times to make tender ribs, but have failed in past attempts. I decided to try this and am so glad that I did. My search is over! May your search for ribs end here also! I did not marinate them overnight like the recipe, but rubbed them with some seasoned salt and wrapped them in aluminum foil without the BBQ sauce. After the cooking was over, I put them on the grill and brushed them with BBQ sauce and let the sauce set and also let the meat get a little crispier on the outside. They were finger-licking good!","More of a cooking method than a recipe and what a great one it is. Of course make sure you have a tasty BBQ sauce, one that you would happily drink out of the bottle and you will surely end up with the absolute best results.","EXCELLENT RIBS -- Very easy and delicious. Even though wrapped in foil, my pan was a mess, so the next time, I lined the pan in foil also, and clean up was a breeze. Also, after baking, I opened foil, added more sweet bbq sauce and then put them under the broiler for 4 minutes, meaty side up -- SPECTACULAR. Thanks Ken for a GREAT rib recipe. Happy Cooking.","I've been making my baby back ribs this way for years with one big exception - I don' marinade them first. I don't always know at 8am what I'm making for dinner that night but that doesn't stop me from making ribs! I cut the ribs into sections, brush them with bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) wrap them in tin foil and bake low and slow for a couple of hours. They are every bit as tender and fall off the bone as the best restaurants. So if you don't have time to marinade, make them anyway!!",I made these ribs following the recipe. I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce recipe found on this site. When the ribs were done I opened the foil wrap and applied more sauce and placed them under the broiler for about 7 minutes. My wife said that the ribs were to die for and I have to agree. The BBQ sauce is the best also. Thanks KHEFFN,"These are amazing. I have never eaten anything like this before. The meat was very tender and delicious. Please try this recipe. Add your own rub to make it suit your tastes for you and your family. Good stuff, thanks for the post.","This was SOOOO good! I bought the ribs and BBQ sauce (i like Bulleye's Honey Roast) in the morning, cut the ribs, put them on tin foil, smothered them in sauce, and wrapped them up! Then threw them in the oven in the afternoon, and by dinner they were perfect! I also put some potatoes in the oven about 2 hours before dinner, so we had ribs and baked potatoes! As the ribs marinated all day, I did all my errands, came back, and threw them in the oven, and then did some more work at home. My friends thought I was in the kitchen all day slaving over dinner. And the meat fell right off the bone. This was delicious. I wish I could give it more than five stars.",Great ribs!,,,,,,,,,
134,"We have been making this alfredo sauce for about two years, and I wanted to share a hint. If you sift a little bit of cornstarch into your shredded cheese, and squeeze some fresh lemon juice into the sauce while you are adding your cheese, it will become nice and creamy. We love this recipe, but we also change it a little by adding freshly minced garlic and some asiago along with the romano and parmesan. This stuff is so good we dip our bread into it!","i chose this recipe because it had the best reviews. and it really is very very good. i scaled down the recipe to 4 servings, but beware because the pasta it calls for is WAY too much, especially if you like a lot of sauce. my recommendation is to make the sauce according to this recipe's scale but make the amount of pasta according to the pasta box/label. i also love garlic in my alfredo so i minced about 5 cloves of garlic and added it to the sauce. also make sure that you are watching the sauce at all times and stirring often because the sauce tends to stick at the bottom and curdle there. also added chicken strips sauteed in butter and lawry's garlic salt, which added the saltiness the dish needed, since i made the sauce a little more on the bland side. i made it once with margarine and half and half to skim calories but it does not turn out that well. it tends to congeal and is not as creamy or thick so if you're looking to skim calories, this is not the recipe to do it with. my husband who is obsessed with alfredo thinks it is the best he's ever had. we love alfredo and thought olive garden had the best, but now we will be making this at home. very simple recipe, and love that all the ingredients are so accessible, and doesn't require an egg!","I am writing a review of my own recipe in response to some of the reviews... ...So that everyone knows, this is an authentic Italian (Olive Garden is NOT Italian) recipe for Fettuccine Alfredo, therefore, it doesn't have garlic. Garlic is an American addition to the dish. I didn't leave it out on accident, nor am I preparing the dish incorrectly. Thank you for all of the positive feedback!! Erin","Pretty good - very similar to Olive Garden. Best thing besides taste is that this recipe has no egg in it! Good even without the parmesean added at the end. If you have leftovers and the butter separates, add more cream before heating and stir after heating - it will be just like when it was fresh. Be careful of this stuff though - sauce is extremely fattening!!! Great as a once in a while treat.","You couldn't get it any more correct, this is the ""method"", can't bring myself to call it a recipe since it was a spur of the moment concoction of Alfredo's of Rome. My husband and I go every April and when we did this last year we were staying just a few feet from this city's icon, so of course we went and had their signature dish. This is it! They do however, rub a cut garlic bulb inside the pasta bowl just like a good Ceasar salad. Remember to reserve at least a 1/2 cup of your pasta water to thin the sauce before serving, it thickens rapidly.","True to its claim! It really is to die for. I used some chopped fresh basil from my garden and added more Parmesan and Romano. This sauce is wonderful over Penne Rigate with shrimp, scallops and crab! My company loved it. They said better than their favorite seafood restaurant!","This is excellent! Very rich and delicious. I've subbed more parmesan for the romano, and it's just as good. I've even made it once accidentally with half-and-half, and it still turned out great and was even re-heatable. Overall, a great recipe, even to our picky Italian family!","I fixed this one night and loved it.. Only now it has ruied me for Olive Gardens, because this is so much better then theirs.","Very buttery! I think half the butter would have worked fine. But I am also a picky alfredo sauce eater, so others may think it was wonderful.","Be careful! This recipe calls for 3/4 of a PINT (1.5 cups) of heavy cream, not 3/4 of a CUP, which is what I thought. I had to add 1/2 cup of Half & Half because I didn't have any extra heavy cream. I took another reviewer's advice and added the lemon juice. Mine didn't thicken up but maybe that was the Half & Half or maybe I didn't cook it long enough (I get impatient), but it did taste really good. It was very salty (I used salted butter). I might put a little less salt in next time, and definitely the correct amount of cream. Overall, I thought it was really good for my first go round with alfredo (which I love). Thanks for the recipe, Erinmarie. I will definitely make again!","Great recipe!! Before adding the cheese, I brought the cream to a boil and then reduced the heat to low. After adding the cheese, I heated for about 20 mins. This will help it to thicken. I added chopped chicken, tomatoes, green onions, and sprinkled a little cajun spice on top and served it with garlic bread. My family loved it!!!","Do not listen to the haters. Also, if you think it is expensive to make, don't make it, simple as that! This is my Italian mother's recipe and the only one I make. Also, don't squeak on the butter. Make the recipe people! I like to add a bit of fresh grated nutmeg in mine. Erinmarie, keep on making this and do not listen to anyone else.","I have made this a few times since discovering it a couple of months ago, and it is awesome! I made one little change this last time I cooked it. I added some minced garlic but still did the garlic salt. I swear it tasted just like Olive Garden or at least pretty darn close. I am a beginner cook and this recipe is so simple, there is really no messing it up. I also used the whole pint of cream because I didn't want to leave that little bit in there and have it go to waste, plus I like a little extra sauce. I also cooked some chicken and tossed it in when I was coating the noodles. Now when I get a craving for Olive Garden I can save a good $50-$60 dollars (family of 5!), and make this at home for a fraction of the price!!! So glad I found this recipe!",This sauce was not that great. It called for some pricey ingredients and wasn't worth it. I have many store bought jars of alfredo sauce that tasted better than this. Don't waste your time,"WOW- 5 stars for a terrific base recipe! My changes: I only used 3/4 cup butter, sauteed 2 cloves garlic in it before adding the heavy cream, and seasoned with basil leaves and nutmeg (in place of the salt and garlic salt) when i added the pepper. I thought it looked thin but the consistency was perfect once I added the fettuccine (16 oz). Delicious~thanks so much!",If you add a small container of lump crab meat you have a meal fit for the gods!!,"Very good basic sauce. Great with ""sugar snap peas or fresh aspargus, and grilled chicken added to it. For those people out there that had some ""trouble"" with the sauce. Stay ""away from ""garlic salt"" anytime you cook. Use ""garlic powder and real garlic minced. Also, it was ""not the ""half and half, that caused the problem, it was the ""fact the one reader used ""margine"". I've been using ""fat free"" half and half ""for years, and no problem. Its up to the individual ""taste"" whether to use ""salted or unsalted"" butter, but you MUST use REAL butter! This is a ""one time treat, so use the real butter! That is something you just can't do without. A ""pinch of ""nutmeg"" does wonders, and it is ""often the missing star ingredient"". Enjoy!!","Am I the only one who didn't like this recipe? It did not taste good and was a waste of ingredients ad time. I followed the recipe exactly and still came out wrong, anything I'm doing wrong?",I use about half the butter and add lots of garlic. Pair with chicken and broccoli... oh so good!,"This was great and I would definitely make it again. Minus one star for the proportions being so off. I kept everything the same, except I only used about half the butter and the fettucine called for, and it was the perfect amount of sauce. So definitely cut the pasta in half. And you do not need all that butter. Also, the sauce was pretty thin and kind of lumpy, no matter how long I heated it to melt the cheese. It might have been because the romano I used was shredded instead of grated. Either way, it was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again, with different proportions of ingredients.","I made this for the first time last night (31/12/2011)for New Years eve potluck party, it was so easy and quick to make. Honestly i was worried about how it was going to turn out as i was already late getting to the party... i put in butter once melted and used real garlic (mince 5 cloves), heavy / thickened cream, then the cheeses, salt and pepper to taste. Things to watch out for pls taste ur sauce to make sure it is not too salty before putting in the fettuccine and always keeps stirring ur sauce for beautiful consistency. Anyway it turned out excellent & tastes awesome! Had so many compliments and saw ppl helping themselves to seconds ?? Great Start to the New Year 2012 thank you for sharing this recipe!","Sooo good!. . But, 24 oz of pasta and 1c butter is too much! I halved the butter and I would still use less next time. We used about 12-16 oz of pasta. Subbed minced garlic (1T?) for garlic salt. Used onlly parm cheese b/c that is what I had on hand. Finished off w/ fresh ground pepper and parsley. Very good. Will definitely be our only alredo recipe we use! Thanks!","Oh so good. I did as had been suggested: I mixed about a tablespoon of corn starch with the cheeses before adding to the cream. I sauted garlic in the butter before adding the cream. And I added the juice of half a lemon with the cheese. Also, used additional Asiago cheese. Then I added shrimp that I had sauted in butter. Yum",It is great! A little Italian grandmother gave me the following advice. Add diced cooked ham and a small tin of tomatoe paste. O Boy! Was that a fantastic addition!!!,"This recipe is amazing, however, I believe the salty problem may be from the use of garlic SALT instead of fresh garlic or garlic powder. I prefer to use the fresh or minced garlic (store bought). I also omitted the salt from the mixture as an additive. I didn't have any salt problem with mine after these changes. I live for an amazing dinner of fettucine alfredo but I also 'love' garlic in my food, so chose to include it as well as others. Thanks for the information on the original fettucine recipe Erinmarie, it was very much appreciated.","This was fantastic fettuccine alfredo, very reminiscent of Olive Garden's version. I halved the recipe and had plenty for four served alongside steamed broccoli. Delicious recipe, thank you. update: I made this a second time and my fiance can't stop talking about it! He's telling EVERYONE that it is better than any fettuccine alfredo he's ever had (and of course he's giving me all of the credit!). This time I used a blend of parmesan and mozzarella as well as the romano, and the flavors were wonderful. I also added a dash of nutmeg each time, which really brought out the flavors. With salted butter, I did not need to add any salt, but I added a sprinkle of pepper- even less than the nutmeg. Thanks so much for the great recipe!!","I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it. It was very creamy, rich, and delicious. My daughter said it was better than Olive Garden! I served with chicken breasts sauteed in butter and garlic and used about half of the pasta called for in the recipe. Quite yummy, but we will have to save this recipe for special occasions due to the calories!","Delicious! I didn't use as much butter as the recipe calls for, I used about 2/3rds. DELICIOUS! There's never any leftovers. :)",This was really really good. The Recipe I had before was too bland. But this is really good. Thank you. I added a little more then a dash of garlic salt because I love flavors.,with the butter and heavy cream....it is literally 'to die for',"This recipe is amazing!! I have never written a review but I have to for this one. I have been making it for a couple years now and have got nothing but rave reviews about it. I use the already sliced romano, asiago, and parmesan cheese from Trader Joes, it is the perfect amount for this recipe. I also add quite a bit more garlic but other than that I follow it to a T.",,,,,

136,"I couldn't give this a 5 rating because I more than tripled the seasonings (specially the garlic), and I cut back a little on the sugar/ketchup (which is already pretty sweet). I also cut the vinegar in half. Basically, I used your ingredients and then modified them to our taste. I read the reviews and most of the people whorated it low complained that is was bland. I learned from a friend on this site (sdk999) that when you cook in a slow cooker you have to increase your seasonings and I have to agree.","Fantastic! I bought a roast from M&M meat shops, and defrosted it. I put potatoes in the bottom, covered by an onion, the roast over that, and filled in the sides of the slow cooker with baby carrots. I poured the sauce over top and left it alone. It was FANTASTIC!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. The pork was tender and juicy. The vegetables were done to perfection!",Loved it!! Made it exactly as written. Wouldn't change a thing. I pierced the roast with a fork MANY times so the flavor would soak in. Wonderful!,"I made a lot of changes, so although I thought this was a 5-star dinner, I think it was due to input from other reviewers and some of my own revisions. I did brown the pork in about 1/2 Tbsp of oil with 1 tsp of butter. For the sauce I mixed 1.5 cups beef broth, 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar, 3 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1 Tbsp of white sugar, 1 Tbsp of ketchup, 1 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp of salt (since the beef broth is pretty salty), 1 tsp each of garlic power and onion poweder, 1/2 tsp each of paprika and dry mustard, about 1 tsp of Frank's Red Hot and a dash of worcestershire. I layered about 8 medium red pototoes (peeled) on the bottom of the crock pot, covered with onions, then put the browned roast on top. Then I added baby carrots all around the sides. I cooked on high for about 1 hour, then turned down to low and cooked for another 5 hours. After 5 hours, I sliced the pork into about 10-12 pieces and put it in the bottom of the crock pot so it would be submerged in the juices. I cooked for 1 additional hour and then removed all the veggies and pork and kept them warm on a platter. Then I poured the juice into a pot, added a cornstarch slurry and brought it to a boil to make a gravy. It was AWESOME! And pretty healthy too! Thanks for the great start, K :)","We really enjoyed this, and how convenient it is! I scrubbed some small red potatoes and put them in the pot whole with the pork, steamed some asparagus to go with it, and voila, an easy and healthy dinner. I made two very minor changes to the basic recipe. I used raw sugar instead of white, and substituted some chili infused vinegar for the red wine vinegar. This is one of those really good basic recipes that you can make so many little changes to and use over and over again. I'm going to try using hoisin, then teriyaki, in place of the ketchup to see how they change the taste.",I read a few of the different reviews and found them helpful. I cut the roast into four pieces and browned them. From there I followed the ingredients listed in the original recipe and added about 5 red potatoes. I quartered the potatoes and tossed them on top of the roast pieces. I set the slow cooker for 5 hours on low. This is a keeper!,"This was a winner, & I found it so easy to prepare. A great meal for hot weather as you use the crock-pot I used a small pork roast--about 1-l/2 pounds-- better fit for my small slow-cooker, & it turned out great. I sliced it and served it on hamburger buns with some of the onions that were cooked with meat, added some barbecue sauce & mustard - & voila! …Hot pork sandwiches! PS: A note of caution—the meat comes out of slow cooker pale, so if you want it to look brown, better brown it in a pan before putting it into the crock-pot. I didn’t do this, but I added teriyaki sauce and later some barbecue sauce over the top to get it “browner”….& of course, those things added to the overall flavor.",Husband loves this recipe. I used pork chops instead of roast. I used balsamic vinegar instead red wine and it gave it a nice zip. I also doubled the recipe for the sauce in order to make a nice gravy. A+++ recipe a favorite in my house.,"This was a very moist Pork Roast I have ever made & tasted. I shredded the leftover and we had Barbeque Sandwiches the next day meal. I just use the juice from roast and add Barbeque sauce and heat them together, It was just about as good as the Roast.","This recipe is good and seems promising, but I only gave it four stars because we liked it better when I made some changes. Most important: I completely omitted the water and doubled the rest of the sauce recipe, so the pork gets more intense flavor from the juice it cooks in. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I used low sodium soy sauce and fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I omitted the salt, but added 1/4 t. ground ginger. In addition to the onion, I added some baby carrots, putting both under the roast in the slow cooker (I've always read that you should put your root veggies under the meat in the crock). With these changes, it was excellent.",I must say this has to be the WORST recipe i have tried from here. The juice in the pot was watery. the roast had no flavour. No ammount of extra seasoning could save this mess.,"No penetrated flavors here also. It was pretty good, but a tad too sweet. When I make this again, I'll either cut down on the sugar or the ketchup. It was overkill. Thanks, though. It is a very good basic recipe to work with.","Okay, so I was getting nervous as this was cooking... all I could smell was the vinegar. I doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the sugar, used chicken broth in place of the water, added worcestershire sauce, fresh garlic, dried basil and sliced mushrooms (towards the end). I strained the onions to thicken the gravy, and served over buttered egg noodles with green beans and carrots. What a delicious meal! Thank you, K!",Great Flavor! I doubled the recipe since I had a larger portion of pork. Will make again!,"Very tasty and the house smelled awesome. Per other reviews, I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup red wine, used brown sugar, used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added potatoes and carrots while cooking the roast. This makes a wonderful gravy and makes a meal that is so easy to put together.","When I made this, I think I added too much water, because it was more of a broth than a glaze. I rate it a 4 because I made it wrong. My boyfriend loved it however. I accidentally bought tenderloin instead of loin and the meat was moist and tasty.","Wow! I've never made a pork loin that turned out so perfect! (not even my own posted recipe for tenderloin!) I made a few adjustments, based on preference/what I had on hand: reduced sugar to 2T, 1T red wine vinegar + 2T balsamic vinegar, chile sauce instead of ketchup and hot sauce (used 4 pkts from the local Chinese restaurant!), minced garlic (from a jar). I put the roast on top of a Vidalia onion, added 2 celery stalks cut in thirds, and spread the garlic all over the top of the roast. I cooked for 3 hrs on high, did a check with the thermometer (160 deg), turned it down to low for about 3/4 hr (170 deg), turned it off and then let it rest in the pot with the lid off while finishing up everything else. Served with garlic mashed potatoes, steamed carrots and Texas Toast--my husband and guests commented that this was probably better than any pork they've ever had in a restaurant. Yeah!! Even the picky 7-yr-old said it tasted good! Thanks for the recipe :D",Really excellent - BUT - it absolutely does NOT need the cup of hot water. There is more than enough liquid from the roast/onions/sauce. I've made this 4 times since I found it and it comes out perfectly every time without the added liquid.,"Was it tangy? Yes. Did the meat fall apart? Definitely. Would I make it again? No. I followed the recipe exactly. The meat was certainly edible, but all we could taste was vinegar and sugar. The sauce was watery and pungent. We slathered barbecue sauce over the meat to make it taste better. With all the positive reviews, I thought it would be better. My bad.","I will look forward to making this but felt compelled to say that adding potatoes to any slow cook recipe robs the dish of it's flavor, mainly the salt. I will stick with the egg noodles, add a little garlic and let you know how it goes.","Tried this recipe last night - definitely a WINNER in my book !! Tho...I added slices of fresh lemon, placed slices both underneath as well as arranged on top of the roast (My Dad's suggestion - he's a retired Fireman - all Firemen in Ca. are exceptional cooks !) - used Worcestershire Sauce instead of Soy, only 1/3 cup water and Brown sugar instead of white - served with Teriyaki rice and Veggies - turned out...JUST TO DIE FOR !! The hint of lemon taste may be the ""Tangy"" taste you are all looking for !!","Extremely simple, delicious. Followed directions exactly. 6 1/2 hours on high in crock pot.","very good! I made a few changes based on the reviews and this turned out quite tasty. first, I seasoned the pork loin with garlic powder and pepper and seared it on all sides till nicely browned. Then I added the 1C water to the hot skillet scraping up all the browned bits. I doubled the rest of the seasonings exept for the hot peper sauce, which I used 2t of, and substituted splenda for sugar. I added them to the water from the skillet and poured this over the browned pork loin, and added a bag of baby carrots on top of that. cooked on high for 2 hrs then turned to low for another 3 hrs. Delicious and very tender.","Wow! I made this for our dinner tonight. I started with 2-2lb pork roasts and a large sweet onion, I doubled the sauce ingredients, and let it cook all day. I ended up not using the sauce, because I made some Lipton Onion Soup Roasted potatoes and Sugar Snap Peas and Parisienne Carrots to go with it. The sauce seemed a bit sweet anyway, but the roasts turned out perfectly seasoned (not really tangy, just good flavor)and very moist and tender. I only made one substitution, which was Balsamic Vinegar in place of the Red Wine Vinegar. What a delicious dinner. Even my 10 and 5 year old are happy with it, and my 5 year old son is extremely picky and cautious about what he'll put in his mouth. Great recipe. I noted several others complained it wasn't how they liked their BBQ pork,and I have but one suggestion. Try cooking a pork recipe that actually has BBQ in the name of it. I really liked Barbecued Pork Two Ways, posted by Kimber for a nice crockpot bbq pork recipe. Thanks for the great recipe K!","The kids enjoyed this, even the picky one, but he didn't eat much. The adults felt it was way too sweet and would've been better to use the pork with a nice BBQ sauce than this too sweet one. I'd suggest using less sugar.","This was great! The pork was fall-apart tender after about 7 hours on low. I played with the sauce ingredients a bit, however. Instead of ketchup I just used tomato paste, because I had a can of it open that I needed to use up. I also added Worcestershire because in my experience it makes everything better! After the pork was cooked I took it out and stirred about a half cup of light roux and a Tbsp of heavy cream into the thin sauce and ended up with a fantastic gravy to spoon over our rice. Will make again!",,,,,,,,,,

139,"As the aroma of this wafted through the house I just knew we were in for something good and boy, were we! I doubled the amount of spices but left out the cinnamon, and used 4 big cloves of minced, fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. I cut the roast into large chunks so the spices could penetrate the meat better and it worked like a charm. Finally, to make these more authentic, after shredding the meat into smaller chunks I spread it out in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and baked it in a 400 degree oven about 20 minutes, just long enough to crisp the exterior of the meat. Great on it's own, but in a tortilla with a little of the ""Avocado Salad with Bacon and Sour Cream"" this was just over the top good. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned, keeping in mind, however, that I doubled up on the spices. We are looking forward to having the leftovers again tomorrow night!","GREAT!! The recipe is very similar to the one that one was given to me. I add several sprigs of fresh cilantro to the broth in which the pork is simmering. Also at the end, break apart the pork into large chunks and place in a pan with some of the broth and bake at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. This step gets the edges crispy and resembles the authentic style carnitas which is usually fried in lard.","This was absolutely DELICIOUS! After reading some of the reviews, I tripled the spice mix and added chilli powder for heat- I also had a bigger pork roast than was specified. It is virtually no work whatsoever and the pork literally fell apart as I was taking it out of the slow cooker. I let the whole thing cook for 10 hours on a Saturday and then shredded the pork, skimmed the fat off the broth and boiled the broth down. I then added 1/4 cup of chili sauce and 2 tbsp sugar and poured the sauce over the pork. Served the whole thing as part of a make-your-own taco bar for my boyfriend's birthday and not a bit was leftover!","Amazing! my husband likes these better than chipotle. Since some reviewers said the seasoning didn't permeate the entire roast, I cut it into quarters or sometimes a little smaller and then apply the rub. I use a two pound roast with one 14oz can of chicken broth and the stated amt of seasoning. So if I were using a 4 lb roast I would probably double the rub.","mmmm, these were so good and the house smelled great, as well. when my daughter came home, the first words out of her mouth were, ''what smells so good?!'' the meat falls apart and has the most interesting flavor, i think created by the addition of the cinnamon. i tripled all the spices, with the exception of the cinnamon, which i only doubled, and i thought that was the perfect amount--def. present without being over-powering. i also subbed Mexican oregano from my garden for the reg. variety. Last, i sliced half an onion and threw that in as well. !ole! p.s. i didn't bother with turning the meat. there's really no need to.","I made this recipe with the suggestion to double up on the spices except for the cinnamon, but the cinnamon really ruined this recipe and it was too salty for my taste. I liked the other spices and will make again using water and absolutely no cinnamon.","I usually make carnitas in a pot on the stove and it always comes out great. However, since I just bought a slow cooker I thought it would be so nice to try it this way since I wouldn't have to be home in order for it to cook. It came out awesome! I took another reviewer's advice and cooked it for 6 hours instead of 10. (I've got one of those crock pots that gives you the option of 4-6-8 or 10 hours, and it automatically adjusts the temp based on how many hours you put in.) The seasoning was great although once I shredded the meat I did add some salt for some extra flavor. The leftovers were still nice and tender too. Thanks for the recipe!!","Followed advice as given by ""naples34102"". Liked it so much, I'm making it again for company. Super moist.***Review Update: I've made this 5 times now and it's been consistently fantastic until this last time. It was a little bit drier and slightly more chewy. I cooked this batch from a previously FROZEN rump roast and will NEVER FREEZE the meat again! Why spoil perfection!","I quickly ran out of rub the first time I made these, so I have learned to triple the amount of rub the recipe calls for. So tender and flavorful. Very economical and can eat on this for days. Served with tortillas, tomatillo salsa, mexican crumbly queso, chopped tomatoes & onions, and sour cream. Got rave reviews from everyone.","Fantastic! I was looking for a comparable carnitas recipe to the carnitas from Rubios, and these hit the spot! I tripled the spices as recommended by other reviewers, with the case of the exceptions below. I ran out of chicken boullion, so the stock was 3 parts chicken/1 part beef boullion. Because I used the boullion instead of homemade stock (I used it up last week for soup) I also cut the tripled salt in half. All in all, it was bloody fantastic and nothing was left when we were done eating.","This recipe is wonderful and found a new place in my rotation. As it drives me crazy to see reviews that do not resemble the original recipe at all, I followed this recipe exactly the first time -- To Live For!!. The second time, I used pork loin instead, because I had it, but was concerned it would not be as good due to the leaness. If you are like me and are trying to cut some fat from your diet, don't be afraid of this substitute. The pork was great, tender and you don't miss the fat.",I have made this many times and it's very good! I do the following with my left over meat. I heated my corn tortillas in a non stick pan with no oil until hot and soft. I just put the carnita meat and some cheese and rolled. Once rolled I brushed olive oil on each one and placed on cookies sheet sprayed with Pam and baked at 350 for 15-20 min. They were really good and crunchy...NOT greasy or bad for you.,"Authentic or not, this is pretty tasty. I did double the spices like others had, used fresh minced garlic and sea salt. I didn't read the directions clearly before I started cooking, which stated that you were to rub in the spices to the meat before adding the meat to the crockpot. (I can be a bit scatterbrained.) I didn't see that until after I braised the meat. I waited until the meat was braised, set it on a platter to cool a bit, then rubbed the spices into the meat. I took naples advice and shredded the meat onto a baking pan I'd covered with aluminum foil and baked it for about 20 minutes. The cinnamon wasn't a deal breaker for me, it's a subtle flavor that I felt was unique and made the usual dinner better. I served this meat as soft tacos to the fam, but I had it on a bed of sauteed peppers and onions, with a small amount of lowfat pepperjack cheese and FF sour cream. I served it with Mexican Rice 2 and D's Famous Salsa, which are also from this site. My roast was HUGE, almost seven and a half pounds. Make sure when you make this you have a big family/healthy eaters or you don't mind eating leftovers for a couple days. NOTE: This has to be my new favorite way to cook roast. This makes excellent ""salad"" sandwiches.","This is a great recipe! As many others stated, I doubled the spices and then after they were done in the crock pot, I removed all the fat, broke it down into bite-sized pieces and baked it at 400 F for 20 minutes to brown the edges. I also utilized the juices to make Spanish Rice II from this website. Pour the juices into a bowl, let it rest so that it separates, skim the fat from the top (reserve 2 TBSP for rice) and then strain out all solids. I was left with about 3 cups of juices which I used to replace the water called for in the rice. Very, very good! Thank you so much for this recipe.","Excellent! And I agree with the others, the house smells WONDERFUL as this is cooking. For those who commented on the lack of flavor, here is what I did. I rubbed the spice mixture on the night before and let sit in the fridge overnight. This is essential in letting the flavors soak into the meat. My roast was 3.5 pounds and it was perfectly done after 8.5 hours when I checked it. It came out super moist. I pulled the meat, then put it in a foil pan with some of the liquid. I tossed it around a few times then put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. Some nice crispy edges, and moist, savory meat. YUM! The only ingredient change I made was to add the juice of half an orange. Everything was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing. The cinnamon flavor is there, but not overpowering at all. It gives the recipe a unique flavor that make people ask what it is. I did find a light sprinkle of salt over the pulled meat brought out even more flavor. This rivals my favorite carnitas that I usually get in my burrito bowl at that famous fast-food restaurant. I will be making this again and again.","This is so good! It makes sooo much meat, but left overs are a breeze! I place the meat in muffin tins in the freezer until they harden, and then pull them out, wrap them in parchment, and stick them back in the freezer. All you have to do is pop one in the microwave to defrost on a busy weeknight. Thanks for the recipe!","Great recipe, I have been making my own similar version of this for years. I like to add a handful of chopped cilantro and about 1/2 cup chopped onion right on top of the pork when I first put it in the slow cooker. I have also used a can of El Pato(mexican hot tomato sauce) poured over the top and this kicks up the flavor and heat a bit (I love spicy food). If you like your carnitas a little crispy, just throw in the oven on a cookie sheet for about ten minutes. Either way, this recipe produces great carnitas everytime, GUARANTEED!",Made this the other night and it was a HUGE hit. We opted to eat ours rolled in flour tortillas and sprinkled with monty jack cheese. AWESOME !! Will definitely make it again. My son says it's also very tasty on a bun with some Franks Hot Sauce.,"As written this is a 4 1/2-star. As made, it is a 6 star. I will be making this again, and again. I did as most folks said and doubled the spices, all but the salt, which I only did 1.5 as much. I also substituted fresh garlic (3 heads), pureed with a mortar and pestle, substituted allspice for the cinnamon (allspice is a common Mexican spice), and added a bit of lime juice to it all to make it more of a paste rather than a dry rub. It smelled amazing and tasted even better. I found I didn't need all 10 hours - my roast (4 lb) was done in 8.","The secret recipie is---COKE, that is what we add to the carnitas for that extra flavor.","I haven't given 5 stars in a while ... but this recipe is fantastic. The minor changes I made did not alter the recipe so much that it is an actual new recipe, which I see so often in the comments. I doubled the spices except for the salt and the cinnamon. I cut the roast up into quarters. I added whole cloves of garlic to the broth. Last, I browned the meat after I shredded it ... took only about 20 minutes at 400F. My family all raved and asked if I would please make it again. At the end of dinner they were already arguing over who would get the leftovers to eat the next day. The cinnamon adds a little something special to the flavor, but I would not add more than the recipe calls for. I might reduce it a bit next time, but I like the uniqueness it gives to the pork.","My, oh my, was this ever so good. Took a tip from another reviewer and cut up the meat into 4 large chunks so that more surface would be covered by the spices which I doubled and was very glad that I did. The smell alone while this was cooking was phenomenal and it definitely lived up to it's promise. I GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed by this recipe. Thank you Erin Parker - you have alleviated me to stardom in my family and friends eyes!","Excellent! I followed others advice and doubled all the spices except for the cinnamon (1/4 tsp). I cut the meat into large chunks and trimmed off as much fat as I could. Once cooked, the meat fell apart and shredded with ease. I put the shredded meat on a cookie sheet to crisp it up a bit. I stirred a bit of the broth back into the crisped meat before serving. Moist and delicious! It also makes enough to feed a crowd with little work so we served to friends during playoffs. Everyone loved it - very authentic tasting!","made as written, it kills me when people don't follow the recipe and rate it lower. The seasonings were great. I had a two pound roast so I halved the seasonings, I wish I had doubled them. In the crock pot for about 7 hours. I stuck it in the oven for 20 minutes, that was a mistake... it came out dry, not crisp. I will do this recipe again with double the seasonings. Cinnamon is widely used in Mexican cooking, I wouldn't delete it from the recipe based on the reviews here from people who didn't like it. Try it first.","This was delicious, but I did a little tweaking of the recipe. I recommend salt and peppering the meat first and browning in olive oil on all sides to caramelize it before putting it in the crock pot. I also omitted the cinnamon and added fresh garlic, chopped cilantro and sliced yellow onion. Halfway thru I added the juice of one lime, which really brightened the sauce/flavor of the meat, and some garlic salt. Served it soft taco style on corn tortillas with shredded green cabbage, jack cheese, salsa verde from Trader Joes, chopped scallions, cilantro, a little sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice. Muy delicioso!!!!","I made this as written although after reading the reviews most suggested doubling the spices except for the cinammon. I didn't add the cinammon per the reviews. It needed more salt for sure. The taste was good, but not enough spices. Also to give it an authentic outer crispiness after it was done, I cut it in chunks and put them in the broiler for about 8 minutes and added salt. They were delicious. Next time I will double the spices, leave out the cinammon (again) and broil at the end. This will be 5 stars next time. Thanks. It's a keeper.","So tender and juicy! Yum! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added adobo and I doubled the other spices except for the salt. I liked the cinnamon in the seasoning mixture. I used about 1 1/2 T. adobo. I also reduced my chicken broth to 1 cup for a 5 lb pork butt, because I didn't want the meat to taste boiled. It took exactly the 10 hours listed in the recipe. I have been trying to find a good carnitas recipe and this is it! Will definitely use this one again.","I followed the recipe, but I also took a large orange, and rolled it until it was nice and juicy, cut it in half squeezed the juice all over the raw pork in my slow cooker, and then put the orange halves in with everything else",This recipe was amazing! It worked well with pork loin AND pork shoulder. Tossing the shredded pork in the oven greatly enhanced the texture & flavor. This recipe is a real keeper.,,,,,,,
140,"Very delicious! I chilled the batter and marmalade overnight and prepared the shrimp the next day. Even though I lost coconut in the oil, a lot was still on the shrimp. Chilling is the secret. For the reviewer who said it wasn't sweet enough, try adding 1/2c of the coconut to the batter, plus 2 T sugar and 1/2 t salt. The dipping sauce I used was 1/2 c orange marmalade, 2 t mustard, 1 t prepared horseradish, dash salt, and honey to taste. Yes, it's laborious, but worth the effort for a great recipe like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,"It's a great recipe with some modifications. An Italian friend of mine who cooks told me that the proper way to make smooth Carbonara sauce is to combine the beaten eggs with the grated parmesan, and then to pour that mixture onto the spaghetti once the spaghetti has cooled slightly (so that it's still hot, but so that the eggs don't cook and the cheese melts seamlessly into the eggs and pasta). I tried that, and the sauce was unbelievably creamy! A few other changes I made - I used less pasta, pancetta instead of bacon, and grated a brick of fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano for a sharper flavour - so that was about 3 cups of grated cheese instead of 1 cup. The final product was full of flavour and my guests wanted seconds - and no need to add salt. I didn't use wine because I didn't have any at the moment, but next time I will - it will probably add some interesting dimension. Also tips on reheating in microwave - if it's on a high setting, it will cook the egg and the pasta will solidify. I reheat mine on medium heat so the sauce stays creamy.","SandyT. here -- thanks for all the positive reviews! This recipe is a home adaptation of one from Angeli Restaurant in Los Angeles (where I was pastry chef for four years). The original recipe used cured, unsmoked Italian pancetta bacon (which is delicious if you can find it). Myself, I use applewood smoked American bacon, and usually double the amount in the recipe. All your suggestions (adding cream, peas, mushrooms, etc., or omitting things) are great, because cooking should constantly evolve, depending on the cook. Please continue to let your personal tastes be your guide!","Okay, I have to laugh, too, when people say, ""I love it! Now let me modify it!"" This dish is my all-time favorite, and this recipe is simply oustanding! I've never found a recipe online that I thought approached my own version, til now. But (you were waiting for that). . .someone asked for something different. Three things I do different: bacon, cream, and nutmeg. I do half-bacon, half ground mild italian sausage, and set it all aside for later. When doing the ""quick combine"" at the end, I add about 3/4 cup heavy cream, at room temp. And to finish it, about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Overall, it richens it quite a bit, adds to the fat content (no kidding?), but ""warms up"" the flavor in a really rich, winter-night sort of way. Thanks for this terrific (and correct) version of this recipe, Sandy.","This is a near perfect and flawless recipe for the classic Spaghetti alla Carbonara. And even it it wasn't, who cares? It's darn good, which is really the only thing that matters. Traditionally this is made with pancetta (an Italian style bacon) but I actually prefer it this way, with regular ol' bacon! Just one suggestion--to ensure a creamy, silky sauce, mix the cheese and beaten eggs together before stirring into the pasta, off heat. Really nothing else to fiddle with or change here, because this is just delicious stuff!","This was outstanding! I took one of the other reviewers' tips, and so I added 3/4 cup of heavy cream and a little fresh nutmeg. I also doubled the amount of bacon. It was sinfully delicious and even my kids were going on and on about how the dinner 'rocked'! Definitely company worthy also. Thanks for sharing the recipe!","Neither my wife nor I had tried this dish before, so we weren't sure what to expect. Wow...was this good! Here are the changes I made: added 1 egg and an extra clove of garlic (omitted the wine); cooked the bacon, added onions, then the garlic; mixed the eggs with the parmesan cheese; drained the spaghetti and added it to a large bowl, then added the bacon/onion/garlic mixture (be sure to scrape in the drippings, then toss), finally added the egg mixture and tossed well. Served with parmesan and chopped parsley on top. This is definitely a new favorite.","I gave it 3* because I think the ratio of pasta may be too much. Quick hints...upon beating the eggs, try putting some dry Italian seasoning. I used a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash mixed in with the eggs. Great aroma to the dish. To combat the dryness, load up on the olive oil and squeeze in 1/2 a lemon into the mixture. Fresh basil works wonders for all you folks looking for that ""zing"" or feel that the pasta was lacking or missing something. Overall, not bad, but few modifications to suit your taste. But I agree to all out there that used less pasta in the dish. The mixture of the flavors has a very soft taste and with the right porportion of pasta would make it even more flavorful. Best of luck to all. Keep sending those ideas!","My husband is a carbonara snob and loved this - I did use pancetta, however. I think ideas to modify a recipe are very flattering to the Chef who presented it. It's good enough to make it someone elses dish - which is wonderful about this website. Definitely the cream and yes nutmeg, but adding sausage? It is no longer traditional carbonara, but hey... whatever floats your gondola!","THIS is exactly the recipe I've been looking for! I kept trying to get carbonara right, and it never quite made it. This recipe was perfect. I took the other reviewers' suggestions about the cream, but didn't want to leave out the wine, so I put 2 tbsp of white wine and 2 tbsp of cream. It was exquisite!","Finally, a carbonara recipe that recognizes that once you add cream, it is no longer carbonara but alfredo! I can't tell you how many times I've been disappointed going to a restaurant that advertises their alfredo with peas and bacon as ""carbonara"". Carbonara isn't supposed to be saucy, it's supposed to have the egg and cheese more like a coating. If folks want to add cream to theirs because they prefer it that way, that's perfectly fine, it's just not carbonara anymore. This recipe is very similar to mine, I don't use wine in mine, but I can see it having a nice effect on the flavor.",This recipe is awesome! My husband who claims to dislike carbonara ate it up. The only change I made is I added a handful of green peas. Definately a keeper!,"This was okay, but the traditional way is better: saute onion and bacon or pancetta (with fresh parsley and basil) in olive oil. Boil and drain noodles, and toss noodles and bacon/onion mixture together with a mixture of 2 egg YOLKS, a few tablespoons of reserved pasta cooking water, lemon zest, salt and pepper, and then add butter and parmesan and toss together. Traditional recipe uses NO garlic - the sweetness of the onions should dominate, and the lemon zest and basil give it that extra kick. The butter, egg yolk, and pasta water mixture makes the sauce unbelievably creamy, and it coats the noodles perfectly.","This is almost exactly my recipe for carbonara ingredient wise. I mix the eggs, parmesan and spices together first and let this sit however. Once the bacon is cooked I remove most of the fat add the onion and garlic and saute adding the wine at the end. The bacon mixture is then poured into the hot pasta and mixed quickly followed by the egg mixture. It is absolutely delicious and my friends say its the best they have ever had. I have made this hundreds of times and NEVER had a problem with the egggs not cooking so the previous reviewer can rest easy. The pasta needs to be hot, right from the colander. Enjoy this one. Its a winner.",Fabulous!!! My husband has always been wary of carbonara because of the eggs but this turned out so good he had two helpings!!! And I did not modify it- first runs should always be as the cook intended. Love it!!,"I think this recipe is terrific. The only thing that I would comment upon is the lack of emphasis upon using fresh ground black pepper. The dish, a la Carbonara, (carbon or coal) in Italy comes from the generous use of freshly ground (somewhat course, at least not fine) black pepper that gives the dish its characteristic bite and appearance. That was what I found in Italy, at least. Also, I would not object to the use of cream sparingly although as one reviewer pointed out, that is not a part of the original recipe and if used the amount used should certainly not be enough to turn it into an Alfredo. That would be a shame as the pepper and the bacon combine into a divine taste experience that in my opinion should not be dulled with too much cream. Sometimes depending upon the consistency of the final dish I may add more finely grated Parmesan from a fresh chunk.","I love Carbonara, and this recipe was delicious! I lightened it up some (par usual) by cutting the eggs back to 2 and making up the difference in liquid by subbing 1/4 C skim milk and 1/4 C cream for the lost eggs. Same richness, a lot less cholesterol! I also wilted a couple ounces of spinach after sauteing the onion and garlic with the wine because I needed to use it up! It was a wonderful addition to this, which most leafy greens are (kale or escarole works well too). Also, I used turkey bacon rather than pork, another norm for me. One tip for those who are new to this dish: the recipe directions state that you should ""cook until eggs are just set"". Carbonara really should not ""set"". The egg mixture (eggs, cream, milk, cheese, salt, and pepper) should be added once the pasta mixture has been removed from the heat for a few minutes and cooled slightly, then put back on the burner and heated through on low heat, until the sauce is shiny and glistening, almost the consistency of a thin alfredo sauce, NOT set like scrambled eggs!","Very enjoyable recipe. The only change I made was to add 1/2 cream to the scrambled eggs. I also just used the starchy water from the spaghetti in lieu of the wine. I didn't start cooking the noodles until the bacon was out of the pan, and the onions were more than opaque. If you let the noodles cool they will start to dry out and lead to a dry overall dish. Plus, if the noodles are cool, you'll have to cook over heat to make sure the eggs are safe. Wait to cook the noodles! Time it, so that you drain them just after step 2. Then add noodles, egg, cheese and remove from heat. My dish was very creamy, and not at all dry.","I followed the recipe almost exactly - the proportions seemed like it made a huge amount, so I cut it in half. The result was the perfect amount for a light meal for me and my husband with no leftovers. I didn't have bacon but I did have bacon fat - and I discovered that if you have the fat from fantastic bacon, you don't miss the meat! And I mixed the grated parmesan in with the beaten egg. The result was an absolutely luxurious, rich and incredibly simple meal. Whoever is adding cream and nutmeg to this recipe is so off track - if you want heavy alfredo sauce do that. If you want pasta that tastes like you're at a little table in a tiny Roman bistro, do this recipe and don't mess with it. My only quibble is next time I'll do it the *really* right way with some good pancetta and not bacon. Bacon is good here, but pancetta would be great. This, with some roasted vegetables tossed in olive oil on the side and a bottle of good wine will do any marriage a world of good!",Yummy! Combine your eggs w/ the parm cheese and Make sure to remove from heat before stirring in your eggs & parm cheese. I added in 1 cup frozen peas (cook in your pasta water the last 3 minutes w/ your spaghetti) Also the addition of 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg really makes this dish scrumptious!,"I am eating this one as I write. Superb. I reduced the amount of spaghetti by 1/4 per suggestions. I also invested in grating my own pecorino romano cheese for the mix at twice the amount called for which would be a cup (half a wedge works out to about $2.50). Another investment was the 1/4 lb. pancetta to replace the 8 slices bacon.($2.68 as opposed to ?). Once it was finished I did sprinkle freshly grated Wisconsin Parmesan on top. This was rich enough that I cannot see the need for the addition of cream. That would be overkill. Oh, and the fresh parsley? Do not risk getting in a traffic accident rushing to the store if you have none on hand. I am truly savoring this as I type. Thumbs up! Thanks Sandy.","Was pretty good. I over cooked it on accident, so it was not oily/creamy like I think it was supposed to be. I also added peas, I bet mushrooms will be good.","If you ad the eggs to the drained hot pasta and then stir till coated well and put the lid on the pot and let set for a few mins, it turns out amazing! I grew up on a version of this with a stick of melted butter, orageno and bacon! It was my moms cheap dinner for a huge family!","YUM!!! This was the first time I made Carbonara. I didn't know about the eggs and really questioned if I wanted to do it at all. But I had the ingredients and did it! I pretty much followed the directions. I might have use a bit more bacon. I also didn't have onion so used 4 shallots. I followed some advise of other chefs and mixed my parmesan with my eggs. I also added a little cream since I had it in the fridge and needed to use it up! I finally added frozen peas right at the end. This was amazing! LOVED IT! My husband told me to make this over and over again!!! Thank you so much for this recipe! One comment. I know that alot people don't like when you change up recipes. But I find that when I am missing an ingredient, I like to read and see if someone substituted and if it works. I think it is great to add individual interpretations of a recipe as long as it follows the orginial concept.","EXCELLENT! I've made this for a long time but just never reviewed it before. Like so many others, I too mix my cheese into the eggs and allow the heat of the pasta to cook the eggs. For some added richness (like it needs it), I did use up about 1/4 C. sour cream that I had too. Actually mixed that with the eggs and cheese & blended til smooth. Additional parmesan at the table and we were set. Such a classic pasta dish that is a family favorite.","I used 1 cup of grated Parmesan instead of a 1/2 cup and I didn't use wine. I added a couple of ladles of the starchy pasta water to the bacon, onion, and garlic mixture before tossing in the pasta. The addition of the water made the extra olive oil to coat the pasta unnecessary. I mixed the Parmesan cheese and the beaten eggs together before adding it to the pasta.",,,,,,,,,,,
142,"I have a recipe similar to this but used flour tortillas.. I baked my cresent rolls about 4 minutes under time. I included ro-tel & onion in my meat then taco seasoning. I layered mine as follows: rolls, white cheese dip,meat,ranch style beans, sour cream, mexican style cheese then nacho doritos. Last 3 minutes covered with foil so the chips would not burn.. Make sure you SPRAY your glass dish, I did mine in a 9x13.. MMMMM family LOVED it! Will make this again.","Despite the review by the self appointed food police, I found this dish to be quick and easy and very tasty. We are all adults here and we dont need to be reminded to check the trans fat and calories. Ratings like that ruin the purpose of the rating system. Great reciped! Thanks!!!!","My extended family loved this. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9X13 pan. Used low-fat sour cream and Cheddar cheese, but added lowfat refried beans. Garnished with shredded lettuce, olives, diced tomatoes and a tiny bit of salsa and guacamole. Yummy! Made an excellent presentation with the extra color.Thanks for sharing Stephanie.","My husband and I loved this! I browned the beef last night, along with chopped onion, chopped jalapenos and the taco seasoning, which made today's preparation much quicker. After the crescent roll layer baked (I did mine in an 11x7 -had a few crescent rolls left over) I put the meat on, a layer of salsa, then black olives, then the sour cream (not a whole container - just enough to cover) then the cheese, followed by Doritos ""Nacho Cheesier"" chips (crumbled.)Served w/chopped tomatoes to top it with and the Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this website (along w/an asparagus dish)- EXCELLENT meal!",Very easy to make and quite yummy. I took the advice of a pp and mixed the sour cream in with the taco meat and then baked it. Also added some cheese to the baked crescent dough before adding the taco meat. And I make my taco meat with Garden Style taco sauce instead of water. Will be making this again!,"I know I know I knooooow ""You can't rate it when you changed the ingredients"". I didn't omit any ingredients though, just added more things. So I'm rating this 5 stars FOR THE GREAT IDEA AND START TO A VERY VERSITILE RECIPE. Okay, now that that's out of the way. First, I doubled this recipe and put it in a greased 9x13 glass dish. I went w/ another reviewer and baked the dough about 4 min. less than what it called for since it will be cooking some more in the oven when it's all put together. DO NOT DO THAT. The crust was doughy and raw and soggy even after cooking the whole thing for 15 minutes at the temperature I used to cook the dough. Next time I will absolutely cook the dough ALL the way the WHOLE time it calls for. Now, I made the beef like I would normally make it for regular taco meat (add seasoning and simmer w/ water to get the consistancy). I also added 1/2 a chopped onion to the meat while it cooked. I layered it in this order: Dough/Crust, taco meat, 1 can refried beans & 1 16oz container sour cream mixed then spread on top of meat, 1/2 jar of salsa, 1 can of black beans, 1/2 bag of taco seasoned cheese & 1/2 bag of sharp cheddar, then the chips finally on top. Everything about thi was amazing minus my faulty error w/ the dough. You could always do this w/o the crust and just use for a taco dip. AMAZING recipe, thank you for the start of a great thing! This is so easy to omit and add items as you choose!","My family really enjoyed this recipe, from my 1 year old to my hubby. It was easy and delicious. A bonus is that I almost always have the ingredients on hand, so it is sure to be a quick dinner solution on a busy night. From start to finish it took less than 30 minutes to have the meal on the table, that is a major plus. The only suggestion that I would make is (and I should have been smart enough to figure it out)...spray the bottom of your pan with a vegetable spray. I used a glass 9 x 13 pan and thought that the crescent rolls would be buttery enough that they wouldn't stick...wrong. I garnished with the traditional taco toppings. This is a nice family recipe that was easy and enjoyed.","This was very quick and easy, which is a plus in my non-air conditioned apartment in the middle of summer. This does need a little tweeking IMO. Waaaay too salty for my liking between the taco seasoning and tortilla chips. Next time I will find salt-free ones. Also, next time I will not completely cook my crecent rolls. They got a little too browned after putting in the oven the 2nd time to melt the cheese. I cooked mine without the sour cream as I'm not a huge fan unless it's in a dip. I just don't enjoy the taste. I served it on the side with salsa. Fiance said it was really good that way. I do want to try this again, because I think this recipe really has potential. thanks for sharing!","I love it! this is a great base recipe. I've had my own variation for years and never thought to use crescent rolls - what a unique idea. I do see where some might not like the though of a sweet roll in a savory dish - but I'm a little disappointed at the negative reviews. if you see a list of ingredients that doesnt appeal to you and dont make the dish - please dont review it. 2. If you see a list of ingredients that doesnt appeal to you and you make the dish knowing you're going to hate it - why bother? 3. If you don't like chips, or think something is too much - use less. Each recipe is made for a particular taste. I happen to love this dish, I also know that I like my tacos a bit on the spicy side - so I add some spice! no harm in that, I'm making it to my family's taste. I also dont much care for too much salt in certain dishes (I am an admitted saltaholic) so, I used unsalted toasted corn tortilla's. It's really just common sense and its really just curtesy to rate/review. See the idea behind the recipe! then adjust! Having said that.. I love this on baked/toasted pita's too!!!! Thank you for posting the recipe!!!","My family loved this!!! I added salsa and refried beans . I also did not add so much sour cream!!! My famiy gave this a ""10"" I will be making this again!!!","I too omitted the sour cream because my boyfriend doesn't like it. I also used my own spices instead of prepackaged taco seasoning (cumin, chili powder and garlic powder) and covered the meat with water and simmered it down for a better consistency. I also put salsa over the meat when layering the ingredients. It turned out great! Definitely a regular dish around our place now!","I mixed 2 Tbsp. of sour cream into 3/4 can of refried beans (instead of just the sour cream) and got thumbs up from each of my 11 & 12 year old children (aka ""pickies"")! Hubby is out of town, he doesn't care tacos anyway. This was a breeze to clean up! Thanks Stephanie, my children loved it!!",My family has been making this recipe for years and is still one of our favorites. I wanted to review to add a helpful hint we stumbled open: use the Philsbury Pizza Crust in lieu of the crescent rolls. Much easier to deal with than the individual crescent rolls and the difference is not noticable.,"This is a good one. I have also made it with an Italian flavor - ground beef or sausage, onions, marinara, parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.",Awesome recipe! I loved it and so did the kids - even the picky one! Here's what I did: I used a 9 x 13 glass dish. I sprayed it with cooking spray. Lined it with the crescent dough and went up the sides of the pan too. Baked this for 13 minutes. Cooked the meat and added one can of ro-tel mild and the taco seasoning. I could see using venison or ground turkey next time. The flavor with the ro-tel is what really came through. I only used 8oz of lite sour cream and even that was alot. Depending on how much you like s.c. you could cut back on it. I used 8oz of mexi-cheddar cheese - alot but perfect - gotta have the cheese! I used half a bag of nacho Cheese Doritos. I baked it another 10 minutes. I would recommend using at least a 9x13 pan. I'm not sure what size square cake pan was used by the lister of this recipe but I wouldn't be able to fit all of this in a 9inch square. EXCELLENT - 5 STARS - IT'S A KEEPER!! (can't wait for leftovers for lunch!),"Great recipe!! Tip: bake the cresent rolls at 375 for 11 or so minutes according to the package. Then reduce the oven temp to 350 when you put the layered dish back in. The rolls will not burn on the bottom this way. Also, I prepared the meat just as I would have for tacos, water and all. I added chopped onions and bell peppers, and a can of Rotel. I also put a layer of refried beans as others suggested, and doubled up on the cheese. I used crushed nacho flavored chips for the topping. My kiddos and hubby loved it!",SO EASY & DELICIOUS :) used left over ingredients to make Nacho's for a side. Fed 7 people with this recipe and everyone's belly was full !!! definitally will be doing again :) Corona included.,"Well for starters I made this as written the first time and it was really pretty good but, I started to think of how it would work best for my family and be lower in fat. With my changes I make it twice a month now. I use reduced fat crescent rolls. Brown ground turkey throw in the taco packet and a can of tomatoes with green chilies. Layer that on top of the already baked crescent rolls. Then I throw in a drained can of both black beans and corn. Top with cheese then bake. Everyone in my house loves it and we don't even miss the sour cream (I'm not really a fan) or chips.","five star-I also mix in a can of ""traditional"" style refried beans with 1/3 cup of pace mild picante sauce and spread that layer first on pie shell before beef mixture. I add tortilla crumbles after beef mix then follow this recipee but top with cheese finely chopped black olives, mushrooms, sour cream, guacamole and pica de gallo. Just a spoon of each is perfect.","I love mexican food, but this recipe just didn't cut it for me. This is basically a remix of your standard boxed taco dinner kit with the addition of a cresent roll crust. That part was fine. The problem I had with this recipe is that it simply had TOO MUCH SOUR CREAM. Unfortunately the sour cream completely overpowered what would have otherwise been a pleasant twist on a simple taco dinner. My advice: cut the sour cream down to about 4oz and don't use an entire bag of corn chips. Simply crush enough to lightly cover everything. As for the cheese, there's no such thing as too much cheese, so don't change that at all. Simply put, I probably won't be making this again when I can get plenty of satisfaction from a boxed taco dinner kit.","One word.....WINNER!!! My family loves my version of this recipe! Great idea! I used ground turkey instead of beef and added taco seasoning, rotel, and red onion to the meat mixture while I was browning my crescent rolls. After both were ready, I added low-fat sour cream to the already cooked meat then poured meat mixture onto the dough. Topped with cheese and crushed tortilla chips and put in the oven for about 10 more minutes. We topped with shredded lettuce, fresh diced tomatoes and salsa. Yumm-yumm-yummy!!! Next time I am considering layering my meat mixture with black beans or perhaps pinto beans and then topping with the cheese & chips. We'll see how it turns out! I'll be eating it either way! This one's a keeper for me!","It was a good alternative to regular tacos. Next time I wouldn't cook it with the sour cream added, I would top it with it after baking. I did add a layer of medium salsa.","I followed a few of the suggestions- first layer the cooked cresent rolls, then black refried beans, then the meat mixure (I had added onion, garlic and corn to the meat), followed with sour cream, mexican cheese and crumbled nacho cheese Dorito's on top. I think the Dorito's offset the ""sweetness"" of the cresent rolls. I was concerned about this recipe but.... MY FAMILY LOVED IT! Definitely want it added to the rotation. Thanks everyone for the suggestions.",Our family really likes this recipe.,"SUPER DELISH!! My boyfriend and I loved this. I cooked crescent rolls almost all the way. Layered refried beans, sour cream, corn, taco meat, and tons of mexican cheese. Baked for another 10 minutes and then topped with Fritos!! It was awesome!! Will be making again very soon!!","My family loves this. Instead of the sour cream, I poured enchilada sauce over top of the meat and crust. I doubled the recipe in an 11x15 pan and it's the perfect size to eat for several meals during our busy week.","I have dinner at my house on Saturdays for a bunch of guys and am always trying to come up with stuff that will fill them up but not take me all day to make. This recipe fit the bill. I used packages of crecent rolls in the bottom of a 13x9 pan, and about 1.5lbs of ground beef. I also added a refried bean, and salsa layer. The guys LOVED this. It's also good cold, who knew? :D",,,,,,,,,
143,"These are great! I left out the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any, but added some Frank's Chile and Lime sauce. I also used burrito sized tortillas and baked them in the oven instaead of in a skillet. I sprayed a pan with Pam, put the filling and cheese on half a tortilla & folded it in half (this recipe made 4 for me), sprayed the tops with Pam and baked at 350 for 10 minutes then broiled the tops until browned. Cooking in the oven helps when you want to have them all done at once instead of one at a tme. I served with homemade guacamole, sour cream and salsa.","This was SO yummy. Messy but yummy. Only thing I omitted was the red pepper flake. I knew the jarred salsa I had on hand would be hot enough without adding the flake. This scaled down well for me, making two small-ish quesadillas. Very filling.","Every Wednesday night, my roommate, his girlfriend, and myself take turns cooking dinner before our favorite TV Show LOST! My roommate's girlfriend is the only vegetarian, so cooking vegetarian meals has been something new for my roommate and I. Well, let me tell you, this recipe was a big hit! The quesadillas turned out crisp and delicious! Pretty much followed the recipe to T except I substituted a mexican cheese blend for the montery jack. Garnished with sour cream, salsa, Chalulu hot sauce, and the green tabasco. Fantastic! Will definately make them again!","I thought this was really yummy. I read the reviews and left the brown sugar in the recipe, maybe used a tad less than 1 Tbs. I thought it added a nice touch. I added cumin. Instead of using salsa, I used fresh chopped tomatoes that I put on top of the warm mixture in the quesadillas along with some chopped green onions. I will definately be making this again. Its a great meatless dish, but I may try it with chicken some time down the road.",This is a quick easy dish that my family loves. I have made it twice. The only change is folding over the quesadilla to make it easier to handle. Thank you for this healthy meatless meal.,Loved these! I am not a vegeterian but am trying to not eat meat one day a week. I added chopped jalapenos and a little lime juice and left out the red pepper flakes. I also just used cooking spray instead of the oil. I took the suggestion of baking in the oven for 10 min at 350 and then broiling at the end and that worked well if making multiple quesadillas at one time. Stove top works fine if you are just making one.,You truly don't miss the meat in this recipe. I was somewhat skeptical at first. For the onion I used a red onion and used only a third of it. I used half cheddar and half monterey jack cheese. Next time I'm only going to use about 1/2 T of brown sugar. Per other reviews I baked them in the oven for 10 minutes @ 350 and then broiled them for about a minute to brown the tops. Great Recipe! My husband loved them.,Great! The only change I made was I didn't cook in skillet but did two at a time in a 450 degree oven. I spritzed two tortillas with oil and placed those sides on the outside of the quessadilla so they would brown up and get slightly crispy. about 10 minutes and you don't have to flip over!,These are EXCELLENT and so simple to make! I omitted the olive oil and used Canola Spray instead. I also omitted the butter and used the spray. I added fresh chopped jalapeno and a little chopped cilantro. My husband went nuts over these. I paired them with a Puffy Chile Relleno Casserole and it made a perfect dinner.,"Sweet, spicy and savory! What more could you ask for? I love these. Don't let the simpleness of this meal turn you off, these make a great dinner.","The filling for this is delicious, and adding chicken or ground beef is delish as well, my only suggestion is in preparation. I always spray Pam on one side of the tortilla (or you can brush on oil or spread butter) lay the tortilla in the hot pan and place cheese on one half, add topping over cheese then add additional cheese on top and fold over. It's easier to flip it back and forth over the folded side and the cheese on both sides hold it all together and make it neater to eat!!! Just cut into 2 or 3 wedges!","The taste of these quesadillas was excellent, much better than our normal quesadillas. I used frozen Southwestern Corn and added chicken for a heartier meal. My only complaint was that we had to knife and fork it, because it was so messy. Of course I'll be making this again, though. Next time I might use the filling for a Mexican Lasagna, which would be good too.",Yum... I thought these has a really rich flavor and a little sweetness. I added a few drop sof hot sauce and it was perfect. Very good.,"Mmmm...I loved these! I omitted the sugar and seasoned with cumin, salt, and pepper. I added more salsa as well. I buttered the tortillas and layered the filling so the cheese could act like glue to keep the top layer from just falling off.","I wanted something to go with some chicken taco soup I had in the freezer, so I decided these would be a good match. I did make a number of changes. I combined the beans, corn and onion, adding a chopped jalapeno that needed to be used, and a little taco seasoning for more flavor. I was concerned that the salsa might make the tortillas soggy, so I left that out. I omitted the brown sugar altogether. I totally forgot to sauté the onion, so I just warmed the mixture in the microwave. I decided these might be easier to handle if I folded the tortilla rather than stacking one on top of the other. I put the butter in a skillet over very low heat and when melted, I added the tortilla, swirling one side around to make sure it was evenly coated with butter. The warmth of the burner assured that the tortilla would be pliable and wouldn’t crack when folding. I used both pepperjack cheese and cheddar. I layered in this order: cheese, bean mixture and then cheese again. I wanted the cheese to act as a glue to hold these together. Once assembled I transferred them to a cookie sheet and baked them at 350 for 15-20 minutes. I served these on a bed of shredded lettuce, along with salsa and sour cream on the side. These were great! We both liked them and I would do them again the same way!","We've used this recipe twice now, and both times it was absolutely delicious! Now, I made one fortunate mistake when made it the first time: I accidentally bought (organic) refried black beans instead regular black beans (duh, I know). In any case, I had to do something. Therefore, I prepared and cooked all of the ingredients exactly as stated in the recipe; however, I cooked the refried black beans separately. I then layered the tortilla with cheese, corn mix, refried beans, and light cheese and cooked it as normal. It was delicious... absolutely delicious! It was so good that we used the refried black beans the second time. However, this time I cooked the onions; added the corn, brown sugar, red pepper, and salsa; cooked it for two minutes; and then added the refried beans to the corn mix. I constantly stirred the mix for about three minutes on medium/medium-high heat, and then let it simmer on low heat while I added the cheese to the tortilla in another pan. Using a spatula, I then placed a fair amount of the mix in the center of the tortilla, followed by a little cheese. As I placed the second tortilla on the top, I lightly pressed in the center to spread out the mix. It was even better than the first time!!! This recipe is a keeper! (I also recommend using one tortilla instead of two. Add cheese and the corn-bean mix to half of the tortilla, folded it over, and cook as normal. They’re much easier to manage in the pan.)","Very easy to make, but surprisingly tastey. I used a four cheese blend instead of Monterey Jack and it added to the flavor really nicely.",It was just okay.,"My family and I dont eat much meat and decided to try this recipe without meat first and we loved it. I did do a few small changes; I added a pinch of dried green onions, garlic salt and onion powder to the pan after all the other ingredients. I also added a little bit more salsa then let it all simmer on low for about 8-10 min instead of the 3 suggested. Because we dont fry anything I put the cheese and mixture on only half a tortilla shell then folded it in half and heated up on my George Forman using non stick spray (this cuts out all that need for butter). I served them with multi-grain corn chips, salsa, guacamole, and pico de gallo. Made a great summer dinner. Next time I might try adding the chicken like suggested but dont think it needs it.","This recipe was great! I didn't have regular salsa on hand so I replaced it with some corn and bean salsa (why not add some more beans, right?). I also used dried minced onion to make this recipe even quicker and because my husband likes his onions as minuscule as possible. Next time, I'd add a little more heat to this - maybe some cayenne pepper or hot sauce. I also put cheese on both before adding the bean mixture and after so that the tortillas would have something to adhere to (otherwise, you'll have a bunch of the bean mixture falling out when you flip it). Overall a great recipe - even for my husband who thinks that all meals need to include meat!","These were delicious and simple to make. I baked them (15 minutes at 350) so I could make more at a time and also tao save the oil used in frying. Addwed ground beef to my husband's who likes to have meat with supper, and he liked it too. Served with salsa and sour cream, and chopped nutritious salad from this site. Thanks!","This was a simple healthy meal. You can use whole wheat tortillas or also add chicken or refried beans. Since I didn't want to take the time to cook 4 of these on the stove, I cooked them in the oven on 450 for 7 minutes. Spray the cookie sheets lightly with cooking spray and also the tops of the tortillas and you will have one quesadillas for everyone in 7 minutes! No need to turn.","Outstanding! I didn't use brown sugar and added a couple dashes of salt to the bean mixture since my corn was salt free. I used salsa verde, and sharp cheddar cheese. Sprayed flour tortillas with cooking spray and baked in a 350 oven for 15 minutes till brown and crispy. Yummy served with sour cream! Will make again. Easy and delicious!",I love the simplicity of this recipe. I think the Monterey Jack cheese makes this! I usually wouldn't cook Mexican with Monterey Jack cheese. I cooked mine in the oven as other's suggested with broiling for 2 to 3 minutes at the end for browning (don't forget to spray with non-stick cooking spray!) I doubled the salsa and did not add the in sugar at all. Mine made 9 healthy but small quesadillas. Thanks for the recipe!,"WOW!!! what a tasty little dish for someone who thought they didn't like black beans!I wouldn't buy them or try them,and then was gifted 2 cans.(ugh!) I searched recipes and found this--my thoughts were""Well,its easy,has good reviews& I won't waste too many ingredients!!""Boy, did I ever get lucky!! I followed the instructions until the second step,after I softened the onions,I removed them from the skillet.The second step I PURPOSELY BLACKENED the CORN & I think really enhanced the flavor!! I also did add some pre-cooked chicken(because of husband) and also added 1/2 teasp.of chili powder & cumin, and some mexican blend cheese along with the monterrey jack cheese called for. I cooked these on a flat-cast iron skillet & I served this with some mexican rice, guacamole, and sour cream and salsa on the side. My THANKS to EFASSE for a great 5 STAR recipe!!(Oh, and the liberty to add to the recipe,thank you!)",Very tasty! But I had a hard time flipping them without all the beans and corn falling out. Next time I will put mixture on half of the tortilla and fold - much easier to turn over.,"These were awesome, served them with cumin rice. Perfect for a quick dinner. Thanks for sharing.","Not bad at all. A bit too sweet, I think if I make again I would skip the sugar, as the corn is already pretty sweet. Could have used more cheese to glue them together better, mine were really messy and didn't stay together very well but that could just be me, I seem to have that issue with quesadillas! I baked instead of fried and broiled the tops for a couple of minutes to brown nicely. We enjoyed them as is, but I think something like cream cheese to hold the filling together a bit better would be a nice addition.","These were so good! I was a skeptic, but my sweetie loves quesadillas and I was looking for a way to make them meatless to save money but still be filling- jackpot! I'm not a salsa person, so I left that and the red pepper flakes out, then added some fresh basil from my garden and squeezed half a lime into the mix. I think cilantro would probably be good in this too.",,,,,,,
144,This method of cooking may make you hesitant BUT it works every time !!! The trick is DO NOT OPEN THAT OVEN DOOR TO PEAK AT YOUR ROAST - Tape it shut if necessary to stop your curosity... you will absolutely be 100% satisfied if you do this.,"I also add rosemary to the rub mixture. This method really does work every time! You keep the roasting times the same no matter what size roast you use - the larger the roast is, the longer it will continue to cook during the time the oven is turned off. The second roasting time should be 30-40 minutes for rare; add 10-15 more minutes for medium or well.","We tried this recipe yesterday with a 2 1/2 lb rib roast! Fantasic! Rubbed the roast down all over with olive oil, and then rubbed in McCormick's Grill Mates Monteral Steak Seasonings (coarse salt,black pepper,red pepper,garlic and paprika)all over the roast and inbetween where we had the ribs cut. Tied entire roast back together We cut the 1st cooking time down to 30 mins, waited about 2 hrs (the roast was 127 degrees) and then just turned the oven on for about 20 addl' minutes until the roast regisered 145 degrees-Perfect. Just remember NO PEEKING from the time the roast goes in, till it comes out! Smelled Wonderful and tasted even better! Thank You for this recipe, will now really enjoy fixing Rib Roasts no more guessing about the length of time it takes too cook!","A great recipe if none of your side dishes require baking. 5 stars for taste, but subtract a little for the inconvenience of having my oven out-of-commission all day. I cooked it 45 minutes on the second baking as suggested by a previous reviewer that said the recipe as stated cooks a rare roast. (thanks for that tip, btw) Our 9-pounder was nicely medium-rare in the middle, with about two inches on either side of the middle medium-well. PS: Forgot to mention, the butcher ""boned and tied"" the roast for me. (They slice the meat off the bone, then tie it all back together.) Much easier to carve this way.","This is the first prime rib that I have fixed and I too was hesitant when I read the recipe; but, it was awesome. The hardest part of the recipe is NOT opening the oven door. It tasted as good as it smelled while cooking. The next time that I fix a rib roast I am going to put garlic in the roast and put a can of beef broth in the bottom of the pan, I had no au jus, only fat in the bottom of the pan.","We bought a 10.5 lb standing rib roast at Costco to serve for christmas. We had 8 family members coming for dinner and we had already had our quota of ham and turkey. After scouring the internet for prime rib cooking instructions I decided to go with this one because of the large amount of great reviews. The one thing I gleaned from all the advice was that a meat thermometer is crucial. I bought one that has the probe that stays in the meat while the meter stays outside so it can be watched. I am so glad I did it this way. I let the meat sit out for two hours prior to cooking and it was 50 degrees when put in the oven. We like our meat med rare so I decided to use 125 as the max oven temp of the meat. I had read 120 for rare 125 for med rare and 135 for med. Beyond that why bother. After 2 hours and 10 mins the roast was 125. I pulled it out of the oven and let it sit for 45 mins. It rose to 130 degrees. I turned the oven back on 30 mins (300 degrees) before serving. The probe registered 130 when I cut the meat. The outside was beautiful and the inside was perfect. A little med on the ends and med rare in the middle. Everyone loved it and sang my praises. Thank you so much for the recipe. My one piece of advice, use a meat thermometer because all ovens are different and most roasts cook a little different then the last one you cooked.","This is by far the BEST recipe I've ever used for rib roast! It doesn't matter what size roast you have, just follow these cooking instructions. I was very sceptical, but this was soooo tender and delicious. I'll only cook rib roast this way in the future. THANKS!","Perfect, absolutely perfect. I also didn't feel comfortable with the style of cooking, but perfect. I used the same times, did not open the oven for the entire 3 hours, but did add some potatoes upon reheating to 375. They were perfectly cooked as well (quartered red potatoes with caramelized onion and garlic). Used the salt and pepper measurements and added some Sint Maarten Guavaberry Blackening. Half the amount of the salt, a quarter of the pepper. Used a 4.16 lb. roast. Spectacular, the meat itself is delicious, just need to cook it right. THIS IS THE WAY.","I respectfully disagree with MJG1940 who said with this method of preparing a prime rib it doesn't continue to cook once out of the oven because it doesn't have a bone. Think about it: Potatoes, cookies, cake, hardboiled eggs, pasta, casseroles, etc. all continue to cook once they are out of the oven/boiling water, and they don't have a bone. Not only does the roast continue to cook because of the internal heat, but as it cool a little the juices run slower and give a more juicy roast when it is carved. I never buy a prime rib with bones, it seems like a waste of money to me. BUT, this recipe needs to be adjusted for larger cuts of meat After you have baked it for one hour, let it set, then turned the oven back on, the recommend times for :. 3-5 lbs. 30-35; 6-7 lbs, 40-45; and 8-10 lbs, 50-60 minutes. Be sure to let it sit for 10-15 minutes before carving it. AND make sure you DON'T open the oven door during the entire process. If you need an oven, remember, that is why God made Crock Pots, microwaves and electric fry pans!","As a first time prime rib roaster, I was a little nervous but this recipe was soooo easy and I had great results. However, the given preparation time should reflect the additional hour of pre-roasting rest. Novice cooks may fail to allow enough total time.","I was so disappointed about ONE thing- I kept scrolling down reading review hoping someone would mention if rib roast is supposed to be cooked covered or uncovered. I could not find any clue, so I began cooking it covered, then went to another help site and found out you NEVER roast prime rib covered!! Arghhh! I had to open the oven to take off the cover halfway through the cooking process which defeated the whole ""secret"" to this recipe. It may be common sense to an experienced cook or to those who have done this before, but an ESSENTIAL piece of information to someone who is doing it for the first time ever! I don't know know if I ruined it...we'll see. I changed my rating to a 5 star, because in spite of the little problem I had, the roast turned out SUPERB!! The only other changes I made was to rub it with Montreal Steak Seasoning, and it was so juicy and tasty! Keeper recipe!","This is an amazing recipe. I even hesitate to call it a recipe since it's more like alchemy or witchcraft on meat. I've never been pleased with my roasts, expecially this type. However, this is truly amazing. I had some questions about the method, etc, so I decided to record my experience carefully. Here's the amazing numbers. 6 lb. roast; inserted digital themometer at outset. Roasted uncovered on a rack in my roaster. It rested on the counter top for at least an hour before going into a well preheated oven. After 1 hr the internal temo. of the meat was 111 det F. Oven off: at 1hr,38 min temp was 127' 2hr,21min it was 135', at 4 hrs total time temp was 126' It sat for about 30min and then the oven back on at 375. I was amazed at how quickly the temp increased inside the meat. At 15 min it was back to 132'. At 33 min it was 147' and I took it out after 37min at 1509 degrees. It then sat for the better part of an hour. When I cut into it I was blown away. This is not your average cooking stuff. Somebody has spoken to the cow god. Thanks so much for sharing. Believe it, Do it, and enjoy certain applause",This is a wonderful Recipe. I added quite a bit more Garlic Powder on the top cap and put two cups of water in the bottom of the roaster to make Ajus. Two the water I add 1 Tsp of Kitchen Boquet browning sauce and about 5 drops of Wright's liquid smoke. This is how we cooked Prime Rib in our Restaurant for 35 years and always had rave reviews.,"It DOES matter how large or most importantly how small the roast is when selecting your baking time. I followed recipe EXACTLY and am now staring at a black, overcooked, dry rib roast. Terrible.",I cooked a rib roast last year for Christmas just like the instructions say and it was outstanding. Everyone raved.,"I've been usng this method for roasting prime rib for at least 25 years. The recipe came from my mother. For those who don't want to have their overn tied up for 4 or more hours, it isn't necessary to leave the roast in the oven for 3 hours prior mto turning on the oven again. The trick is to roast for 1 hour at 375, turn off the oven,but don't open the door and turn on the oven at 375 for another 30 minutes prior to removing from the oven. You do not have to wait 3 hours, the waiting time can bew as little as 1 hour. The roast will turn out perfectly medium rare every time.","Made this roast for Christmas and it turned out perfectly medium-rare and delicious. I did stud mine with garlic, which added something nice, I think.","If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I, like many other members, was very skeptical about this recipe . . . and cooking this cut of meat in general. I have never ever made a roast and was pretty worried about how to cook it. After reading all the other rave reviews I decided I was going to give it a shot. I was expecting 16 people for xmas dinner and it was my first year making it myself (so you can see why I was so worried). I used a 9 pound cut of meat and followed the directions pretty much to a T except that I rubbed the spices all over the meat & let it sit over night before coooking it. I was afraid that I or someone else would open the oven so I taped it shut. At times I thought the roast might be cooking too much or not enough and again too much. BUT, when I opened that oven door it revealed the most perfect rib roast I have ever laid eyes on. And when we cut it open everyone oohed & awed! Because the meat was 9 pounds I did keep it in the over for 45-50 minutes on the last cooking time rather than 30-40 and it came out perfectly. This was the best prime rib I have ever had - put Cattleman's to shame. I will definitely be making this again & again. My whole family loved it. I will never be afraid to cook that $80 cut of meat again - this recipe is truly fool proof. Thank you for sharing!",i jus read somewhere to never cover it ....u should really put that on there ..thats an important step!!!,I learned this foolproof method from a cooking instructor approximately 40 years ago. It is the heated bones in the roast that continues the cooking when the oven is off. Therefore this method will not work for a boneless rib roast.,"The absolute best! Thank you! I used a ten pound roast and only had to add about 20 minutes to the final roasting time. It was THE best prime rib I've ever had, and the rest of the guest raved about it. It was cooked perfectly, light medium rare in the inside and medium towards the outer ends. Total perfection! Don't forget to let it rest when you take it out of the oven. THANKS! 12/16/10 Not really an update, I was just sitting in traffic for the last hour day dreaming about this prime rib! It was THAT good. I will never cook it any other way! FYI for those of you cooking a larger roast like I did, don't be afraid, follow it to a T, just add some time to the end. ENJOY. Here I am again brushing up on this recipe for tomorrow. I always like reread my own notes and others reviews. And if I read about Paula Dean one more time I'm afraid I will lose my appetite! Anyway cannot wait to make this tomorrow!! 12/3/17 Another ten pounder in the oven! First time in new oven so a tad nervous over here. Using the convection roast feature. Already did the hour at 375. Door is closed tightly. Will be turning it back on in about an hour. ?? Fingers crossed!","I keep seeing people attribute this to Paula Deen, but my grandma cooked her roasts like this, and my mom did as well (and since I am in my 50s now I know its been around a while). My grandma died before Paula Deen hit the airwaves, so when I see people who keep saying give credit where credit is due...should do just that. 2005? Seriously? This recipe has been around for generations!! This rib roast has NEVER failed to deliver. If yours turned out tough, you did something wrong or you got a bad piece of meat! I get up Christmas morning, take it out to let it reach room temp and we open presents. Start the oven, rub it down with spices (the roast not the oven LOL!), and in it goes. It cooks an hour while we play with our ""stuff"" and then I turn it off, and off we go to my parents. When we get back, I pull it out and cook everything else. Generally the potatoes go in the bottom of the pan in the drippings with onions and peppers, they roast and then I put the roast back in on top to finish it. Rolls? No problem, the roast is supposed to rest for 10 minutes anyways. Easiest Christmas dinner ever!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

146,"My husband prefers center cut, boneless chops (which are kind of thick), so the first time I used this recipe, the chops didn't turn out as tender as I had expected. Tonight, I butterflied and tenderized the chops and they turned out absolutely delicious. I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers and cut back on the butter. I also broiled the chops on both sides after they were cooked to eliminate the mushiness. Even my three year old, who never eats pork chops, absolutely loved them!","This is the recipe my mom has used since I was a child. Ritz crackers are the key. For everyone using substitutes for the breading, you are missing out on the best breading. Also,""flash"" brown the chops at high to med/high heat to keep them moist (as you would veal).","I love this easy pork chops recipe, so good and so easy to prepare. I have made it several times and the family loved it, especially our little girl. The only change I made on this recipe is to use the Ritz cracker with garlic flavor, two eggs and cut down butter to ¼ cup. To give the baked pork chops a bit of crunchy taste, I followed other members’ advice and remove the foil for the last 15 minutes in the oven. I normally serve this dish with macaroni and cheese with a can of veggie. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.","I wasn't searching for a low-fat recipe, so I have to give this one 5 stars! Very tasty - my husband never likes baked pork chops, but loved these! I added parsley and used Garlic Butter flavored Ritz. Yum! Save your egg - you only need 2. Definitely use 1/2 of the butter, turn over after 20 minutes, and uncover at the end.","Made these the other day, and DH gave these a thumbs up. This one is a keeper. Instead of butter, the chops were browned in light olive oil in a frying pan and transferred to a sheet cake pan, lined with foil & sprayed lightly with olive oil spray. Baked them at 300 degrees, uncovered in the pan for about 25 minutes, then turned them over and baked them for another 25 minutes. During the last 15 minutes, the temperature was increased to 375 degrees so that they would be crispy. These chops were very tender and good.","Very disappointing. Little flavor and soggy chops! This recipe requires too many modifications to prevent it from joining the ranks of ""just another pork chop"" which unfortunately as written, it is......","Not bad at all! I made 6 boneless chops about one inch thick each. Instead of salt and garlic I sprinkled them with just Seasoning Salt, and I only needed two beaten eggs to coat them. I crushed up about 2 cups of fat free seasoned croutons in my food processor and coated them with those. I love to use croutons instead of bread crumbs for extra crunch and flavor. I had about a half of stick of real butter left from my holiday baking so I dabbed that all over, and poured the remaining croutons on top. I didn't flip them. They were nice and moist and quite tasty! Thanks!",These were great! So moist and tender. I did remove foil for the last 15 minutes so that they browned a ittle bit and weren't too soggy. Will make again.,"We loved these chops. They are tasty and have great flavor. Plus, very easy to adjust the recipe to cook for only one or two people. The only think I would change is to decrease the amount of butter used on top of the chops. I think one tablespoon per chop would be more than enough. I used two as the recipe called for and thought it was way too much. My chops were swimming in it and didn't crisp as much as I thought they would have without that much butter.","I have made this recipe twice already, and my husband loves it. It is super easy to make, and gets done quickly. I would recommend turning the chops when half-way done, do be sure that the bread crumbs are cooked all the way on both sides. Also be sure to place the butter evenly over the tops, so that it will melt properly. I too broiled mine the last five minutes, to eliminate the mushiness. Great flavor!!! Thanks, Heather!!",This recipe is fabulous. I used about 1/2 the butter. I will definately make this again.,"This is a simple, basic way of oven cooking pork chops and my family loved it! I had 8 boneless chops, so I increased the ingredients with the exception of the butter. I only sliced up about 2 tablespoons and it was plenty to place around the meat. Also, I crushed up 2 sleeves of crackers and had plenty left over. Next time I will only use 1 1/2 sleeves. I placed them in a Ziploc bag and used a rolling pin to quickly turn them to crumbs. After dipping the chicken in the eggs, (I only used 2 eggs, too.)I dropped them in the bag of crumbs, shook it a little, then really pressed the crumbs into the meat. Next time I may try the garlic crackers like other reveiwers suggested. Also, during the last few minutes of cooking, I turned on the broiler and flipped them over to crisp up each side. I baked them on a Silpat in a sheet pan and they turned out crispy, yet juicy on the inside!","An easier way to do these and get crispy crust is to put several tbs. of cooking oil on foil lined pan and spread around. Place chops on this and spray chops very lightly w/olive oil. Bake at 375. After 20 minutes, turn the chops. Cook another 20 min. Will be crispy and moist.","Love these! Been making them for years! You can use the breading of your choice (bread crumbs, Ritz cracker crumbs, saltine crumbs, etc. - don't be afraid to experiment!!), and I would suggest the following simple changes: Use garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt (more garlic flavor, less unneeded sodium), and for the butter part -- take 3 to 4 tablespoons of butter and place in an oven proof dish. Place in hot oven and allow to melt completely and even begin to sizzle a little. THEN add your breaded chops to melted butter, flip over (so both sides are ""buttered"" and bake as recommended. This will give you a nice, crunchy coating when done baking and avoid the sogginess some folks have mentioned. (Part of the reason some of you are finding your chops are coming out soggy is because of the way the original recipe states to add the butter, but even more so, it's how much butter is called for - wayyyy too much, causing your chops to simmer in butter instead of browning in it.)","Great recipe - turned out yummy. Simple comfort food. Read reviews and did the following alterations: Crumb Ritz crackers coarsely for more texture. used all the butter and 1 t. of garlic salt. Baked for 20 mins, turned over, sprinkled with remaining crumbs. Baked for another 20 min and removed cover and bumped up temp to 400 degrees to bake for the final 15 mins. Got the crust I wanted for texture but without soggy.",Try adding a tablespoon of Dijon to the egg and adding some rosemary to the crumbs for an added kick of taste! WoW! That gives it the 5 stars for sure!,"this recipe gets 5stars..tried it last night, did the double dip, lightly sprayed olive oil in bottom of PYREX dish, think the glass contributes to the browning issue, half the butter, took others suggestions, a little parmeson in the crushed cornflakes, a dab of dijon in the egg dip...the chops were perfectly brown, crispy, tender and juicy...adding to the rotation..thanks..and to the puritans who resent giving 5 stars when others use a little enhancement to a dish...a good cook always knows how to tweak a recipe...the originator deserves 5 stars for the initial recipe...","This is a good recipe for bone-in pork chops. Soggy? I believe that the correct term is ""tender"". Too many people grew up on overcooked, dried out pork chops. This isn't 1960!","So, I wish I read the reviews first. My chops were too thick, and I thought that would be a problem, and it was. Next time I will certainly either butterfly them and tenderize them, or get thin cut chops. Secondly, I am disappointed that the recipe mentions nothing about uncovering them, or turning them over. It is sad that you have to read all the reviews in order to get a recipe that would be ideal. I guess that is something that I need to remember about this site. There are many great recipes, but most of them have been tested and altered by so many folks, it is hard to tell what to do sometimes. This time, my chops came out looking quite pale, and I had to broil them uncovered for 10 additional minutes, but the bottoms were still quite mushy, so I ended up turning them and broiling them again. That ended up in too much cooking time. I really enjoyed the flavor though, and will certainly do this again, but buyer beware, make sure you read the reviews, and read them carefully. This primary recipe is good with the alternative methods, but left much to be desired if you followed the main recipe steps.","I took the advice of several of you: only use half the butter, turn over the chops hqlf way through the cooking cycle... then broil for about 3 minutes. About half-way through making iled/mashed potatoes, steaming broccoli (sp?), and the pork chop preparation.. I swear I said to myself ""I should have gotten fast food, I should have gotten fast food...etc (it was a long day at work today before all this - - not to mention logistically getting a car towed to get worked on in the middle of dinner)... anyway, after all was said and done... my pork chops ended up being the best pork chops ever made on the face of the earth ...that may be a slight exaggration. My daughters and wife loved them and I shall never think of fast food as an alternative to this dinner. Delicious beyond measure...and I can only think of 99% of all other pork chops I've had .. the cooks always salted them to death... they should know better.",I have been making this recipe for years with nothing but compliments from friends and family. If you are a huge fan of Parmesan cheese as I am you'll throw in a few tablespoons of the cheese into the crumb mix. Delicious!,"Wonderful recipe. However, after reading all the reviews, I, too, added some igredients here and there to make it my own (added Dijon to the eggs, added parmesan, pepper and fresh sage to the Ritz cracker crumbs). A lot of the reviews seemed to have trouble with the baking of the chops ---- too soggy, etc. Well, try this: I followed the recipe (with my own additions), BUT I did not use a casserole dish. I battered and breaded the pork chops (approx 3/4 inch thick) then placed them on a (greased) rack that had been placed on a cookie sheet I only added a couple of small pieces of butter to the top of the chops before baking). I adjusted the cooking time to 425 degrees for 16 -22 minutes. The chops turned out great - no turning, no broilig, no sogginess. Just a suggestions. Loved it!",I thought they weren't crispy enough and the Ritz crackers were too sweet tasting for pork chops in my opinion. I like a coating that is crispier and with a more savory flavor. I think I will stick to my traditional breading using Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs. I think oven frying them in Canola oil produces a crisper crust than using the butter and is healthier as well. We didn't hate them but they weren't good enough to become a family favorite or replace my old standby made with a breadcrumb coating.,"Excellent dish... hard to believe that Ritz crackers and garlic salt could produce such a delectable dish. I used 1"" thick boneless chops, so I ended up cooking them 15 minutes more longer than the suggested 45 minutes. I also reduced the butter to about 1/2 the suggested amount. The was really no need for all that butter. And I removed the foil for the last 1/2 of the cooking time so they were crispier and not soggy. They were juicy and tender. My hubby LOVED them. He kept asking where I got such a great recipe.",We loved these.....but did use 1/2 the butter and they were great!!,"Five stars from my husband, who does not like ""breaded"" chops! Both of my kids enjoyed them also. We broiled them a coupe minutes before serving just to brown them up a bit. Thanks for a great recipe!","Great recipe, have been enjoying for years since I was a kid and my Mother made them. However, you might want to try crushed cornflakes instead of crackers, they are crispy and very tasty!","This one is *in the rotation* - regularly appears on my family's dinner table. I double-dip, from the cracker crumbs back to the egg, then another turn in the crumbs. I also add some poultry seasoning to the crumb mixture. Yummy.","Instead of garlic salt, I went on Food Network and found Paula Dean's House Seasoning recipe and used about a teaspoon or two of that as the seasoning for my Ritz cracker crumbs. Covering these while cooking keeps them moist so they don't turn into saw dust chops, but they do look kind of wet and anemic when they're done. So, when they were nearly done cooking I removed the cover and turned the broiler on medium-low and broiled the chops for 2-3 minutes each side or until they were a light caramel brown and slightly crispy. They were absolutely perfect after that. Will do these again and again!","This is wonderful, I add some shredded sharp cheddar to the mixture ,my husband asks for this at least once a week!! You can also do this with chicken breasts............Amazing",,,,,,

149,"This is almost exactly how I make stuffed peppers. Except that I brown and season the meat before hand, pour off the oil , mix in the remaing ingredients,stuff the peppers, and then cover during baking. I never baste...the steam does the basting for me. The last five minutes of baking remove cover and sprinkle grated mozzarella or cheddar over each pepper for added flavor if you like.",Loved the recipe but the green peppers need to be blanched before being put into the oven. Put green peppers into boiling water for 1 - 2 minutes then quickly put in ice water. Then proceed with recipe as is. Green pepper have a much better consistency this way.,Note: We have updated this recipe to include a step for browning the beef prior to stuffing the peppers. - The Staff,"I made this drunk. In a toaster oven. With ketchup and sliced cheese. Also, no worcesterrshire sauce or onoin powder or garlic powder. It was amazing. I'm still drunk. And it's still amazing. Rock on.","I found that the sauce in this recipie was not enough, as there was none in the bottom of the pan for basting. Also, it was a little to thick.I think a thinner sauce and more of it, would make for better basting. This recipie did not specify wheather to bake covered or not. This can definately affect baking results.I would, however try this dish again, making certain revisions. It was pretty good but could stand some improvements.***UPDATE- I originaly gave this recipe 4 stars, however,I have made some revitions and will now give this recipe 5 stars. Here is what I do....Do not precook the ground beef. Mix uncooked beef with 1/2 C instant rice. (saves time) Instead of garlic and onion powder,sautee 1 small onion, finely chopped, and 2 cloves minced garlic in olive oil prior to adding to meat mixture. Also I add 1/2 of a 15 oz can of italian style stewed or diced tomatoes and 1/2 t italian seasoning to meat mixture. For the sauce I use 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 can of tomatoes, pureed,a dash of sugar and 1/2 t of italian seasoning. Or,you can substitute jared marinara sauce for tomato sauce in both meat mixture and over the top. This works well. These can also be cooked in a slow cooker on high for 2 1/2-3 hrs or untill thermometer inserted into center reads 160 degrees. Enjoy!","This was my first time to make stuffed peppers. I steamed my peppers for about 15 minutes before hand to soften and to reduce cooking time. While cooking the meat, I added ALOT of onion powder and 2 cloves of garlic, minced. I used brown rice. I mixed together with regular tomato sauce and worcestershire. Then topped with basil, oregano, garlic tomato sauce because that was the only other can I had available. I baked at 350 for 30 minutes, I did not baste every 15 minutes. They turned out tender, not mushy, and wonderful. My husband has never had stuffed peppers in his life and loved them, actually went back for seconds. My children (10 & 6)topped theirs with parmesean cheese and ate the meat out of the middle, thought it tasted like the meat used in spaghetti sauce. They both tried a taste of the pepper, which made mom happy. Maybe next time they'll try more. Great recipe!","I followed suit with the reviewer who dirtied only one skillet to cook the rice and beef. I sauteed 1/2 onion, and a few cloves of garlic for 10 min. I removed and browned meat(used the beef, pork, veal mix for better flavor) draining all the gross grease and returned the tasty onion mixture back again. I then added the 2 cans of tomato sauce, worcestershire sauce, rice, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and a dash of paprika, and 1 cup water like the other reviewer suggested(dont think it really needed all that water-maybe half) and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Toward the end I added in some shredded cheddar cheese(love cheese). I stuffed red, orange, and yellow peppers and placed in a casserole dish on top of tomato sauce and baked as directed. They were good but I tend to like a little more rice in my stuffed peppers so next time I will add a tad more rice..otherwise these were very enjoyable.","Good, solid, basic recipe for stuffed peppers that offers the freedom to tweak to your own liking. I could see this recipe in a basic and general reference-type cookbook. I did put my own spin on this as well. I used green, orange, yellow and red bell peppers, not just for color but for a milder, sweeter flavor. I cut them in half lengthwise, then blanched them for about three minutes before transfering them to an ice bath. I cooked the rice, but did NOT cook the meat - added an egg, chopped onion, minced garlic rather than the garlic and onion powders, fresh chopped parsley, oregano and thyme, as well as salt, pepper, a handful of grated Parmesan cheese, and tomato sauce I had put up from my garden. Poured more sauce over the peppers than called for, dotted with butter, then baked for about 45 minutes. Now it's a five star recipe in my book!","These turned out DELICIOUS and flavorful! Even with a few substitutions: Used ground turkey vs. ground beef, added a can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic (omitted garlic powder) to ground turkey before stuffing, used 2 tsp. of italian dressing (fat-free) vs. 1 tsp., omitted the worchestershire sauce, covered it with foil so no basting needed. This recipe did yield enough filling for only 4 large bell peppers like the other reviewers stated, which made 1 bell pepper too much for one person. Next time, I'll try and make it for 6 small bell peppers (so there will be enough room for side dishes!). Thanks for the great recipe!",I actually used this recipe with the fresh garlic and onion(I also used one cup of minute rice...all that I had). I stuffed the peppers with an uncooked meat and rice mixture and put it all in my crockpot. I also put more tomato sauce over everything. Let it cook on low for 8-10 hours. Easy and it kept the house cooler on a hot summer day!,"Very good, I added onion & garlic as well, YUM! I ""microwave steam"" the pepper (in my Pampered Chef micro steamer...I love it) for mine, but my hubby likes them cooked per the recipe (a little crisp) he loves them! Sometimes I mix 1/2 beef & 1/2 pork. Thanks Bonnie!!","Very easy to prepare. I think one can of tomato sause isn't enough though, to be able to add to the mixture and baste the peppers. Also, I only get about 3 peppers stuffed. Maybe the ones I use are larger or I fill them more. Anyway, they taste good!","Because I dislike it when someone alters a recipe then rates it, I made this recipe exactly as directed. It was great! Even my kids enjoyed it. Next time I will make more sauce for the topping, but other than that, it was great as is.","I made this as written the first time. The taste is excellent and everyone enjoyed them. I gave it 4 stars because the peppers came out too ""tough"" to be easily cut and eaten. The second time I made them, I did not change anything except I parboiled the peppers for 2 minutes, then dunked them in ice water to stop the cooking. I also cut them in half length-wise. They are easier to stuff this way and allow serving 1/2 pepper for smaller appetites. Also, if you use different colored peppers, you can mix the colors on each plate for a more interesting presentation.","This is the perfect time of year for this recipe. Peppers are still plentiful and affordable locally and meanwhile the temps are cool enough to have the oven on. This is very nice, basic stuffed peppers recipe. I didn't stick to the preparation method as I don't precook the beef or the rice. It requires much longer baking that way but I believe the flavor is so much better. The rice cooks fine with the longer cooking time and I think has a better texture then using precooked rice (which can fall apart and disintegrate after being cooked again in the mix). I bake for an hour and a half covered and then remove the cover for another half hour. Meat, rice and peppers are all done just right for me. Yes, it can be more greasy not precooking and draining the meat but it depends on the ground beef you choose, and I would pick that any day over dry meat. The Worcestershire is a great addition! Used fresh garlic and onion instead of powders. Added a can of diced tomatoes to the 2nd can of tomato sauce before pouring over the filled peppers. Happy tummy and lots of leftovers for the fridge and freezer.","Great recipe !! I also used arborio rice as another reviewer did. Works very well for this recipe. Instead of par boiling the peppers, I gave them a light coat of EVOO and roasted them under the broiler, turning them every so often so as not to burn them, just until they began to soften. Then added the rice and beef mixture and baked for about 15 min. Then topped them with fresh grated Parm. cheese. Very good ! My husband and I both agreed the roasted peppers were a great added flavor. This is a keeper for sure !","We certainly loved this dish. I read all the reviews and made some ""quick"" changes. I did blanche my peppers first for 10 minutes and then put them into cold water. What a difference this made! I browned my beef with some onions and then drained. I used a spanish rice mix (follow the package directions) and added a can of mushrooms, black olives and 2 tsp of red pepper. I also added an Italian blend of cheeses to the mix. For more flavor I used Spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Baked as directed with this recipie and everything was done in a hour. I had plenty of mix left over to freeze for another quick meal. I served this dinner with Rosemary Roasted Potatoes, Spring Mix Salad with homemade Italian Dressing and crusty garlic cheese bread. Awesome!","I have tried other stuffed peppers recipes but I like having the rice and meat cooked first - otherwise the rice can be undercooked and crunchy. Reducing the recipe for 3 people made enough for 4 peppers. I did blanch the peppers first and drained off liquid after browning the meat. Replace the pepper tops because it helps steam the insides and you'll know when its done because the tops will brown. Instead of measuring out the Italian seasoning, I just put the tomato sauce on and then topped each with the dressing - no need to measure it. I've even used spaghetti sauce once. Four peppers fit in my 8x8 glass pan. I put some water on the bottom of the pan without basting and covered all with foil. Remove the foil after 1/2 an hour. Mine only took 45 minutes. Using green, yellow and red peppers makes a nice presentation. I've made this numerous times, great for company.",This is a variation of a recipe my wife found in an old Hunt's cook book right after we got married. We've been enjoying this dish for years. Excellent! Serve with shredded cheddar melted on top. I like to have corn as a side with this dish.,"I just made this recipe (modified) last night and both my hubby and I really enjoyed it. I used two small onions (chopped) and 4 garlic cloves (minced) instead of the dried onion/garlic powder. I almost tripled the W. sauce and added lots of parsley/thyme/tarragon - came out with full of flavor.... also used a veggie spag. sauce instead of the regular tomato sauce and added some bay leaves to the sauce. I pre-steamed the peppers so I only had to put the dish in the oven for about 30 minutes...nearing the end of the 30 minutes, I added parmesan cheese to the tops of the peppers and broiled away... Yummy!!! This recipe is a good starting point - but I think that if I had followed the recipe it would have ended up being a tad bland...","We love this one at our house and I have made it 5 or 6 times. Here is what I do. I use 2 peppers and cut them in half. There is extra filling (probably enough for one more pepper) which I just scoop on the outside of the peppers. (6 Peppers are too expensive for our budget) I poor an extra can of tomato sauce over the top of everything and use lots of italian seasoning. I like to use spanish rice if I have it on hand, white rice works great too. I ""blanched"" the peppers as someone else suggested this last time and it made a HUGE difference. Apparently blanching means boiling them in water for 2 minutes and then putting them in ice cold water before you stuff the peppers. Enjoy","It was OK, but I think it could be really great with a few modifications. 1)Blanch or otherwise pre-cooked the peppers. 2) More tomato sauce, or even adding tomato pieces. Mine dried out even with all the basting. 3) Top with cheese. This was the one missing flavor in the final product.","Thank you for sharing this recipe. I made it last night for the first time! It was delicious. I made the following modifications for fun: I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 Italian sausage (which gave it an extra kick). I also used fresh, chopped mushrooms and real onion and garlic instead of powder. 5 minutes before it was done I sprinkled the tops with colby jack cheese. Yummy...","My first time making these, and they turned out great! I followed the recipe to the letter except that I covered with foil for the first half hour and added some sharp cheddar in the last few minutes. I thought the texture of the peppers was really good - cooked, but crisp. They weren't mushy or overdone at all.","I used red bell peppers and green peppers. The red give it a wonderful slightly sweet flavor. I will use all red next time. Also, to cut fat and carbs, I used extra lean turkey and reduced the amount of rice in half. In addition to 1 can of tomato sauce, I used 1 cup of Pace chunky salsa. I put all the liquid and the uncooked rice in with the browned beef and let it cook 20 min until rice was cooked, then put it in the parboiled peppers for 20 min. No need to baste. Very moist and juicy.","This recipe needed alot of doctoring up! I added in the diced up discarded tops of the bell peppers and real onions to the browned meat, a clove of minced garlic, a can of rotel tomatoes to the sauce, and mozarella and parm cheese in the mixture. stuff the peppers, then poor the rest of the sauce on top of each one and then top with a little sprinkle of cheese! oh yeah, and some fresh basil in with the stuffing","These were delicious! I made them for my first time and they were super easy. We went as far as adding 2.5 times more beef, tomato sauce, and rice. It was still cutting it really close. What made them even better was fresh provolone on top! Mmmmmmm............. We also did the thing where you boil the peppers for 2 minutes first then let them soak in ice cold water. If we didn't, they would have fell apart. We also didn't baste them. We just added half of the sauce first and the rest with 15 minutes to go (when we added the provolone) You all should try it..... delicious!!!!!","i omitted the garlic and onion powders, and instead added one yellow onion chopped and about 2 teaspoons of crushed garlic. i baked mine at 400 for 40 minutes, cut them in half, sprinkled with mozerella and baked for 20 more. i didn't baste them every 15 minutes or cover them with foil, and they came out just fine. next time, i'll add in more tomato sauce and mix in mozerella before stuffing. these are really good and make a full meal alone. they remind me of a pizza without the crust! versatile and great recipe!!","We enjoyed these so much. The flavor was fantastic. I did ended up making quite a few changes based on what was in the fridge - used ground turkey breast, orange peppers, added diced sauted onion, cayanne and red pepper to the filling and topped each one with a slice of sharp cheddar in the last 10 minutes of bake time. I will make these often.","Very simple to make, tastey and everyone ate their dinner! That's what counts in my house. I did soften the peppers the day before in a pot of boiling water as well as pre-cook the rice at the same time. I also heated the assembled peppers in tomatoe sauce. covered with aluminum foil. Dinner was ready to eat in 20 minutes.","I made a few changes to this recipe, based on others' reviews. I added cheese to the mixture and add some chopped onion when I was browning the hamburger. I also covered the baking dish, instead of basting, and cooked for the amount of time specified in the instructions. It turned out incredibly tender. During the last 10 minutes of cooking I took the tinfoil off of the baking dish and added cheese to the top of each pepper. The dish turned out amazing! I had large peppers and filled up five, 3 green and 2 red. We ate 2 for dinner that night, and my husband took the leftovers to work for several days in a row. This is definitely a keeper!","I think this was a great recipe and I followed it exactly as it is. Only reason for three starts is that it was bland. This is a great base recipe, so next time I will make with my own blend of spices.","This recipe turned out great, with a few twists. I used chopped onion and minced garlic in place of the powders. I also boiled the peppers about 4-5 minutes before stuffing them as other reviews suggested. I think they would have still been too crunchy and undercooked if I hadn't. Also they need a whole 15 oz of tomato sauce, maybe more, just for pouring over the peppers in the pan. I will definitely be making this again.","Didn't have italian seasoning, but found a recipe online: equal parts oregano, basil, marjoram, thyme and rosemary. Fabulous! Also, I had a rice snafu (it didn't cook and was crunchy) so I made it with orzo istead and it was really, really, really good. Added cheese like some of the others to top it off too!","Lovely way to serve all the bell peppers popping up in the garden in the summer! But they definitely need to be blanched in boiling water 1st. Brown beef w/ minced garlic and some diced onion. Instead of 2X tom. sauce, I used 1 can tom. soup. Also whilst they're baking, they need a generous sprinkling of shredded cheese! A little bit of work goes into these, but they're well worth it b/c they look so pretty all lined up like delicious meaty, cheesy, pepper soldiers.",

151,"This is my recipe, and it states 1/4 cup of green onion, but my recipe is only about 2tbs or to your preference. Oh and its a simple recipe, open to add any other things you would like to it if you are a veggie lover. Hope you like","Very good! I subbed pickels for the green onion and used dijon mustard. I liked the addition of paprika. Served it on a bun with lettuce, tomato, and a few more pickle planks. Thanks Wifey!!","Wonderful recipe starting with a good base that is great ""as is"" or with additions. The ratio of egg/mayo/mustard are perfect in this. I have had this twice. The first try was just as the recipe states and the second time I added a little celery and dill. Both times were very good! I will be making this again! Thank you for sharing your recipe!",My Mother taught me the secret to great egg salad is to mix the cold mayo with the still hot yolks. This makes a much creamier base to add the rest of the ingredients to.,"My original plan was for an egg salad recipe I had chosen that was a little fussier than this. However, after an earlier experience today with a recipe with a more ""complicated flavor,"" I decided to play it safe and go on the basic side with this recipe instead. It IS delicious, taking me back to earlier days and a simpler style of cooking. (For me that would mean waaaay back in the day :) I mean, didn't everyone's mom make egg salad just like this? This is good just as is, but you can doll it up any way you like. For me, that meant adding celery, because for us it just isn't egg salad without it. But in the end, this is an egg salad recipe for what it is - a good, basic, classic, egg salad, and not for all the fussier things it isn't.","Perfect...... after some tweaking. I hate when people drastically change recipes, but I couldnt find anything on here with all the KEY ingredients for great egg salad. This recipe had a great start. I just added some finely diced celery for crunch, 1 tsp dill weed (gotta have dill in your egg salad sandwich), 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of the green onions (didnt have any on hand) and used dijon mustard for a little more flavor. Turned out great, I ate half of it before it even made it to the fridge for lunch the next day.","it was ok. i would consider it a base recipe. my egg salad was begging for additions, i.e., celery, red bell peppers, or anything with more flavor and color","Update: left in the frig for a bit, but I wouldn't suggest this because it got very runny. It was best when I first mixed it up. Still, a great egg salad/spread! I am going to use the filling for deviled eggs for Father's Day. Original review: I wanted a cold salad/spread for sandwiches for lunch today. I chose this one, and my husband said it tasted like his grandmother's egg salad, which is high praise indeed! Thanks for the post!","Good basic recipe (which is what I was looking for). I left out the onion on personal preference. I added a tiny bit of pickle juice to give it some oomph, next time I think I'll add more. To heck with dicing the eggs by hand (it takes FOREVER), I used my Pampered Chef chopper. Took just minutes to chop up all the eggs! For perfect hard-cooked eggs, the Broiler & Egg Association of Minnesota says to place eggs in single layer in covered saucepan in cold water, bring to boil, remove from heat and let stand for 15 minutes. Once the time has elapsed, place eggs in ice water until cool. This works beautifully - the eggs are done to perfection, there's no green edges, and they peeled quite easily, no tearing!",Great egg salad recipe & so easy to make! I made 2 different egg salad recipes to use up the Easter eggs and this one was the definite winner!,"What can you say about a basic Egg Salad recipe... you like it or you don't! This is the way I have made mine, forever, except I add very finely sliced celery because I like a little crunch. I read all the reviews and some say it's bland but that's a matter of taste. Not everyone likes highly seasoned food and for those who do, you can easily spice it up to suit your taste. Personal preference, as far as seasonings go, should never be a reason to down rate a recipe.",I use 3-4 oz of cream cheese and 2 tbsp of mayo instead of just mayo. Doesn't get runny and the taste/texture is better.,Perfect name - this is delicious egg salad. I used dijon mustard and yellow mustard either way it's great. My husband loved it!,I love this with lettuce on sandwiches. (I don't care for paprika so I left it out) You could also add some curry powder to make it very different.,"I am also hopping on the ""gotta use up easter eggs"" bandwagon with this recipe. I love egg salad sandwiches, and this recipe is pretty good, except being a huge fan of dried dill weed, I had to add a generous amount (a little over a tablespoon's worth) to my mixture. I also omitted the salt and pepper. Thanks wifeyluvs2cook.","This recipe is a prime example of how the most basic ingredients can make something filling and comforting. I cut this in half, added one rib of chopped celery (I like crunch in my egg salad) and use dijon. I ate this on potato bread. So good.","Great basic recipe. A tip: peel the eggs immediately (the shells come off more easily then). I added curry powder (always a ""must-have ingredient"" for egg salad in our house), and I went lighter on the scallions. I also added a bit of tumeric, which heightens the yellow color and adds a valuable nutrient. (Tumeric is an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and an anti-carcinogenic).","Update: I've made this several times and it's absolutely wonderful! Original review: Yummy! Like several other reviewers, I made this egg salad to use up Easter eggs. I put it on the ""Soft Sandwich Buns"" also from this site. Thanks for a great recipe!","This is a good base recipe! I liked the mustard in it. I always like to dress up egg salad, so with this recipe I put it in Garlic with Olive Oil pita bread with some lettuce. THX, it's a keeper!","Great base recipe. Go w/ low fat mayo or my pref fat free miracle whip (I like MW better). A bit of garlic salt & pepper in the finish. Extra onion, use spicy mustard, I might try spicy paprika next time. I also like the addition of some diced red/green peppers in the mix.",Don't forget the sweet relish!,"HIGHLY recommend finding a different cook time. All I did was ruin 8 eggs cooking them this way. I usually just rolling boil them for 5 minutes, and let them sit for another 10 but I decided to follow the recipe. Boil them as usual if you have a way that works.","Yum, great ""base recipe"" for egg salad. I used 10 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 teaspoons mustard, 1/4 cup relish, and two stalks of celery (finely chopped). I didn't use salt and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper. Once on the bread, I sprinkled with paprika. Yum, yum, yum!","Absolutely spot on! Made as directed. used Dijon because I thought that was a given. Does not make as much as you would think. Like my sandwiches full. I would say two, three at best. Perfect for bridal/ baby shower.

Tastes like a deviled egg in convenient salad form.,:) did not have celery but still was great,"I just got done making this and its delishious!! I didnt have no paprika though, i added the rest of the ingred. though and I love it, Thanks for this recipe.","Good basic recipe for egg salad. I also added celery & dill to mine. For those who hate chopping eggs by hand - if you have a pastry cutter/blender, use that to mash the eggs! Goes quickly and gives small uniform pieces.

155,"this is the best kalua pork i've ever had and i'm from hawaii. i had no idea it was so simple to make. i, too, found out that pork butt and pork shoulder is the same thing. i used a boneless, 2lb cut and it made enough for my husband and me with lots of leftovers. it is a little salty, but this is the way it's supposed to taste. it tastes best served with white rice (shortgrain, like sushi rice, not long grain). i also used black hawaiian sea salt, which i found at trader joe's. trader joe's offers black and red. but i noticed that the black sea salt also includes some charcoal ingredients, which helps it to taste more smoky and barbecued. i also used reese's mesquite liquid smoke. the black sea salt made the pork look really unappetizing on the outside, but once it's shredded, you can't really tell. also, i turned it over more than once; several times, in fact, and after shredding, cooked it on low for about another hour to soak up the juices. i added about two cups of shredded cabbage in the last hour or so, which is how it's served in hawaii. my total cooking time was 5 hours on high and 1 hr on low. great recipe and very impressive.",This is a great potluck recipe. I put the juices in the crockpot into a container and into the freezer while I waited for the pork to cool enough to shred. Then I take the hardened fat off the top and pour in the juices oil-free. That may help make this dish less oily.,"Very good recipe! Couldn't tell much of a difference in the traditional ""pig"" and this recipe. Only thing I did differently was to slice open a banana (leave in the peel) and set it on top of the roast while it cooks to give it the taste of actually being wrapped in banana leaves prior to cooking it underground (make sure you remove the banana after the pig is fully cooked). Sounds weird, but this gives the pig a very SLIGHT sweet taste which the islands are famous for. After shredding the meat and removing the fat from the juice, I added 1 more tsp of liquid smoke and let the pig cook in it's juice for 1 hour more. Perfect pig!!! Served with the Hawaiian Cold Slaw from this site (which was a perfect complement to the meal) and Sweet Hawaiian bread rolls. If you close your eyes and listen you'd swear you could hear the waves on the beach, smell the lightly scented breeze in the palms, and feel the sand between your toes. This recipe is that good!! Thanks so much to Kikuchan for submitting it!!!","Having relocated from Hawaii to the mainland 6 yrs. ago, this is the same recipe we all use (even when in Hawaii, because who can afford to roast a whole pig?). Pork Butt works the best (because that is what we are used to and it can be found for .99 lb. Other ingredients to add: 1 Hawaiian chile pepper and for a change of flavor: Garlic and Bay leaves. Since it is impossible to find Hawaiian chili peppers, I use finely and SPARINGLY chopped habanero (about 4 small slices). It is pretty authentic. To those that say the roast is salty: is because the slow cooker intensifies the flavor, so it is best to add less at the beginning and add more later if needed. Just a good rub around the pork with Hawaiian Salt will do it. Happy Grinds! Aloha!","THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!!! If I could give 10 stars I would!! Thanks to margarita4, I found the sea salt(Ming Tsai brand blue ginger at Target.) At first I was looking for something in a papper package like most salts are in and for something white. But it's in a tiny glass jar and the salt is a pinky salmon color(4-oz. $3.99) I had a 7 lb. bone in pork butt. It barely fit in my crock pot, but I managed! I started it at midnight, flipped it over at 8:30 in morning and let it cook until 4:30. Added 2 tsp. additional liquid smoke. It was done before that, but I kept it going like recipe said and there was hardly any fat in this. Hard to believe only 3 ingredients could taste so good! My sister in law lived in Hawaii for 3 yrs. and said it was just like what they had there. I love pork and have had it many ways, this ranks right up there with pig roasts, it is my favorite so far. I had 8 guests and they were all ewing and awing over this. It was fabulous and will make this often. Thanks Kay for sharing this, I'm so grateful!","Really nice smoked flavor, tender, juicy and so easy. I found Hawaiian Sea Salt at Williams-Sonoma but check with specialty/gourmet food stores in your area if you don't have time to order online. Sometimes Hawaiian Sea Salt is called Red Clay Sea Salt and that might help you in your search. The sea salt that I found has an iron red appearance. Next time I will use 1 T. Hawaiian Sea Salt as I found it to be a bit too salty for my taste and that, I am sure, is because I rarely salt my foods. Thank you for a very tasty recipe that I will make again.","My pork was to die for delicious. We had around 30 people over and all they talked about was how good the meat tasted. I bought an 8.5 lb roast, so it wouldn't fit in my crock pot. I set the oven on 200 and let it cook in there for 20 hours. Then when I shredded it, I put the shredded meat in the crock pot, poured some of the juices on it and put the crock pot on warm. Thanks for the delicious recipe!","I read a lot of other reviews and was concerned with the saltiness others complained about. I went out and found the hawaiian clay sea salt and when i tasted it, it was quite different from regular table salt and even coarse salt. I was extrememly impressed by this dish, and having been to many luau's it is very close to what I've had there. I think the key to the dish turning out well is to buy the hawaiian salt--it's MUCH more mild and I think that's the key. I found the salt at whole foods market.","This recipe was fantastic!! It was indistinguishable from the Kalua Pig my dad sends from Hawaii. I used Trader Joe's Black Hawaiian Sea Salt. I put a 3lb roast in the crock pot around 10:30PM, turned it over around 9AM, shredded the pork in the juices around 1PM, and had a delicious meal at 5PM. I put the reheated leftovers over cabbage stir fried with a little soy sauce and garlic powder...and rice. It was DELICIOUS!!!","I'm Hawaiian and have never made my own kalua pig until this year back in Oct. Since then I've made this recipe several times! I love kalua pig and my brother was always the expert and I just thought it was terribly difficult. What a ""lolo"" (in Hawaiian that means ""dork"")...this is the easiest thing I've made next to toast!!! I've used Hawaiian, red sea salt & sea salt from my trips to the south of France. Both are perfect! My mom (who is a goddess in the kitchen) says only use pork butt, so that's all I used and she was right on the money. Each time I've made it, it was for a large group of people. I would cook it for 20-28hrs. I've served it with white sticky rice and with Hawaiian sweet rolls, so people can make little sandwiches. I also put a small dish of Korean BBQ sauce next to the crockpot so people can choose to pour sauce on top. Either way its incredibly good. At new years eve potluck, my dish was the first to be gone! I plan to make it again in a couple days for a bday party. Everyone asks me if I will be making it. Like I said, its easier than toast and will wow your friends and family. I will also add that it was too salty the first time, but since I've made it several more times I've figured it out...1Tablespoon of salt per 4lbs of meat & I add about 1.5cup of water (approx 4-5lbs meat) to dilute salt and add for more juice (to pour over rice). Good luck with this ""ONO"" (good) recipe. Hau'oli Makahiki Hou, e malama pono!","Wow! My family thought it tasted better than the real imu cooked pig we ate at a luau last week. I followed the recipe ingredients measurements on a 3lb boneless pork butt and cooked it for 10 hours. After shredding the meat, I put the meat back into the fat oil still in the crockpot, still on at low heat and added another half tablespoon of liquid smoke. I let it sit for about 15 minutes and it was soooo ""ono"" (mmmmgoood)! Mahalo!","This was my third try making this, the first two times it was just okay, and too salty for my taste. However, the first time I only cooked it on high for 6 hours or so, then shredded and served. The second time, I cooked it overnight, then shredded and served. Both times I used white Hawaiian sea salt, but the second time I added apple sider hoping it would give it a little extra something. I'm determined to get a good kalua recipe for a party I hope to have next month and all my searches kept coming back to this recipe so I had to give it another shot. This time, I followed some of the other reviewers tips and it was great! Here is what I did differently: I used a smaller (3 pound) bonless pork shoulder, 1.5 teasp MESQUITE liquid smoke, 1.5 teasp. RED hawaiian sea salt, and placed an unpeeled (but cracked open) banana on top of the roast in the crockpot. Cooked on low for 10 hours, then put the drippings in the freezer for an hour and then skimmed the fat off. Shredded the pork and placed it back in the crockpot with the defatted juices for about another 3 hours (remember I have a smaller roast) and it was so much better this time around! I think the shredding and putting it back to simmer makes a huge difference. This is now my party recipe! Thanks to all for sharing your tips, it's much appreciated! note: my husband has a sweet tooth and wanted me to try adding a little brown sugar at the end, so we'll try that as well, for a non authentic but sweeter variation. ;)","Can't believe the complaints this had no flavor, it's pork, salt & smoke, not supposed to have a bunch of different flavors. Does bacon have a lot of flavors? No & it's yummy! (Though this isn't supposed to be as salty as bacon). Also many saying it's way too salty, I suspect they didn't use the right kind of salt. I assume this was written for the big chunky Hawaiian sea salts, which where I shop is sold in a bag right next to canisters of super-fine Hawaiian sea salt (finer than table salt). If you use the latter it would certainly be way too salty. If I don't have the chunky salt I use half the amount of kosher salt & it's not too salty, you still get the yummy flavor of pork. This makes quite a lot of meat, & for us it's 3 whole meals...(day 1) Kalua pork, served with sticky rice & mac salad; (day 2) Pulled pork - add BBQ sauce & nuke, serve on buns; (day 3) Carnitas - crisp up the pork in a skillet with a squirt of juice from a plastic lime, sprinkle of cumin, & fresh cilantro if I have it, served with guacamole & salsa. Love it when leftovers can be made into meals that are so different they don't seem like leftovers, & all 3 of these meals are inexpensive, easy, & don't require hardly any hands-on time in the kitchen!","THIS WAS DELICIOUS. I MADE THIS THE FIRST TIME WITH SEA SALT AS I DID NOT HAVE THE HAWAIIAN SEA SALT. IT WAS SUPERB. I WANTED TO MAKE IT AGAIN SO I LOOKED FOR THE HAWAIIAN VERSION IN THE STORE AND WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE PRICE OF $14.00! I WAS SO CURIOUS TO SEE IF THERE WAS SUCH A DIFFERENCE THAT I BOUGHT IT. SAVE YOUR MONEY, I COULD TELL NO DIFFERENCE! SERVED IT WITH YELLOW RICE WITH BLACK BEANS...SOOOO GOOD!","Rewrite of review..again :) - I've been making this recipe since 2002 and its always a winner! Its gone to work potlucks, quite a few luaus, and for a different change of pace for Christmas (2008), I made some kalua pig instead of ham or turkey for the family. 8lbs of meat (2 - approx 4lb bonesless porkbutts w/out skin...the asian markets have great butchers!) in 2 crockpots. My family was a little peeved cause we werent having turkey or ham, but once I started shredding the meat...the buzzards (my family) started hovering around the kitchen sneaking tastes of this delicious shredded pork when I wasnt looking. My tips for this recipe - If you have an asian market in your city, go there for your meat. Get a bonesless cut (I paid a little more than $11 for 8lbs of meat!). Pierce meat and rub with sea salt and smoke. I eyeball the amount and never measure. But I will tell you, do the smoke first and then the sea salt. Go easy on the sea salt as the liquid smoke already has a high sodium content. Cook low for 10 hours. Drain/shread meat and put back in crockpot to keep warm. Try to keep your family from eating all the meat before mealtime. For my grandad, I heated up some homemade bbq sauce (he has problems swallowing and needs everything coated to do gown easier), but everyone (including him) said that the meat was fantastic just on its own. Great recipe!!!","This is delicious! I have vacationed in Hawaii many times and was so delighted to find an easy version to try at home. After reading pages and pages of reviews, and making this several times, I have found the perfect recipe to suit everyone I have entertained. This recipe is pretty much fool-proof, only things I do different are: remove the big layer of fat; I find the marbling throughout the pork butt/shoulder gives off enough juices. Then add about a half cup of pineapple juice to the slowcooker, add my fork stabbed, salt rubbed and liquid smoked pork, then topped with 2 bananas, peels on and just a slit along it length wise. Thats it! After 6 hours I flip it, another 6 and its ready to shred! Juices go into a tall glass and into the freezer while I shred, skim off fat, then return fatless juices to the slowcooker with the now shredded pork. I leave in for about an hour to soak up juices, then serve however I feel like it. One of my favorite ways is to cook this overnight, then for breakfast make scrambled eggs, the Kalua pork, and wrap in a whole wheat tortilla. Yup! I use a 5.5 bone in shoulder/butt.","SIMPLY INCREDIBLE! If it all possible FIND Hawaiian Sea Salt, it makes a difference. A nice pork butt, bone in with some fat, a couple of bananas with a small slice down the side placed on top. Put it in and leave it alone for 20 hours except for a halfway turn. Drain off the fat by either placing in the freezer and skimming or using a fat separator. Pour back in the juices and throw in a little crushed pineapple with some juice and some hot peppers and it's WOW TIME. I'm embarassed to tell people how easy this is!! Thanks so much!!!","This is the real deal! I am from Hawaii and living in the mainland, so no imu roasts in the yard like we had growing up. Slow cooker is the next best thing. This is basically the same recipe I have been using to introduce the mainlanders to our way of eating. Sea salt is a must! If you use regular salt it will be way too salty. I have just 2 small recommendations. 1) Place the pork butt with the fat side up to start. 2) Mix the liquid smoke with 2 cups water and pour over the top before coating with the sea salt. With the water added, no need to turn the pork. Just let it cook on high for 8-10 hours and shred. Add the pork back to the liquid because it's loaded with flavor. ... To really go island style, chop up a head of cabbage and add to the shredded pork then cook until it softens. May need a little pepper and soy sauce as the cabbage sucks up the salt. Broke da mouth! (delicious)","Made this for my family and everyone loved it. I did use red hawaiian salt (Williams Sanoma) I used a baggie over my hand to rub the salt and liquid smoke over the pork so my hand didn't smell like liq. smoke. I cooked it on high for about 6 hours, removed the pork and the fat and shredded the meat. I drained the liquid then placed in the freezer to strain the fat. Added the shredded pork to the crock pot with some of the strained liquid. Cooked for 2 more hours...perfect!","I'm from Hawaii, and this IS a great starter recipe! Once the pork is done cooking, I remove it from the slow cooker (save the drippings), shred it, and add a small cabbage (quartered), and 1 large sweet Maui onion (sliced). I toss it with the pork and juices, and 1 tbl. shouyu and, add it back into the slow cooker. I cover it, put it on medium, and cook for an additional 45 minutes to soften the cabbage and onions. If I'm pressed for time, I've also sauteed the cabbage and onions to decrease the cooking time. This also goes great with a nice coleslaw and pineapple salad on the side. (P.S. Choosing a good Hawaiian Sea Salt is important...look for the words ""Alae"" in the title. Amazon carries a few).","I had such great expectations after reading all these wonderful reviews. First I had never used a Boston Butt Roast---Even though I trimmed and trimmed the cut of meat,this dish still was fattier than what I am used to after cooking. What saved the day was the Carolina Bar-b-que Sauce recipe that I found on this site. If it had not been for that sauce this would have been a big flop. And even then it was not as outstanding as these reviews would indicate.","Wow! Seemed too simple to be flavorful. I cooked a 9lb shoulder butt, so I increased the salt and liquid smoke by a smidge. On low it only took 9hrs, not 20. I went to turn it at 9h and it fell apart. I made this the night before a party, shredded it and put the juices from the crockpot in a container in the fridge. Cooled, I skimmed the congealled fat from the sauce leaving the gelatin-like juices, reheated the juice, added another splash of liquid smoke (easy to over-do so go slow) the reheated the whole pot of yumminess. People at this party wanted to know if they should put BBQ sauce on it. I told them to try it first. Needless to say, the BBQ sauce stayed on the table and NOT on the pork. I served it on King's Hawaiian honey wheat buns, and topped with fresh LIGHTLY vinegared slaw. The sweetness of the buns, the salty smokey pork and crispy cole slaw..Perfect Combo","This is an outstanding recipe, and one I have been making for sometime now. In order to mimic the bannana leaves, I always put a layer of fresh greens (Spinach, kale, etc.) in the bottom of the slow cooker before I place the roast. The greens also make a great accompaniment to the pork. Forget the mesurement of the salt and liquid smoke. Just rub the roast first with sprinkles of liquid smoke and use enough salt to coat. Place upon a hefty bed of greens and cook on low overnight and into the next day. YUM!!!",Absolutely the best. I did mine with clean banana skins (3) and it was just enough to sweeten slightly. Reminded me of home in Hawaii. The banana skin adds that special something other slow cooker recipes lacks.,"I've been making this recipe for a long time now but I never had the pink salt so I had been using regular sea salt. It's still really good. However, I finally came across some pink sea salt and made a 4lb roast. I've never measured the salt. Always just rub the meat down well and sprinkle a a little on top. As for the liquid smoke, I've always used Stubb's but sure any brand should do the job. I never measure that either. Just a couple splashes depending on the size of the meat. Doesn't really take much and still does taste very good if you put too much. A pork roast with bone-in to me taste better but still cheaper and very good without the bone. Don't over cook! Can get dry. We like to leave juices in. Get a pack of Kings Hawaiian Sweet Rolls and that's all you need. If not moist enough, try adding Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce on the roll. My husband bugs for me to make this often. Really is a perfect recipe for pot lucks and large gatherings with little work very few dishes. **To the people who are not giving this a 5 star rating, I seen some used pork loin or regular salt. SEA SALT/HAWAIIAN SEA SALT (the pink Hawaiian sea salt is best), liquid smoke, pork butt or shoulder, a crock pot and a utensil to turn the meat one time while cooking is ALL you need. One of the best tasting and easiest recipes you will ever make.","Extremely tasty! Try this... Add a cup of pineapple juice as well as a splash of soy sauce to help with the flavor, (please try this instead of using bbq sauce which defeats the purpose of making Kalua pork). Also add sauteed some cabbage sauteed in soy sauce to shredded pork. I served with a cold macaroni salad (a simple hawaiian version) Cook 1/2 lb macaroni the rince with cold water. Add 1 cup best foods mayo, 1 finely shredded carrot and 1 cup finely shredded chicken breast Paired on the side of the pork and cabbage over white rice, its delicious and seems to cut the saltiness of the dish. Yum yum!","This recipe is fabulous!! We love Kalua pork, but I made one change: I used a 4.5 lb turkey breast instead of pork since we don't eat much pork. I followed the recipe exactly, except it only took about 9 hrs to cook the turkey. It was so good! It was not dry and we used all of the dripping that it produced as it was shredded. It was not oily at all. The only thing I think it needed a little more salt and maybe a little more liquid smoke (I think pork is cured w/ salt, so maybe that's why the turkey needs more salt). But overall, the flavor was authentic. We live in Hawaii/are Hawaiian. Mahalo for this recipe. I plan to try it with pork in the future and continue making kalua turkey! :)","This is a great alternative to cooking a pig in an imu (in the ground). The best way to make kalua pig and cabbage is to remove the meat once it is finished cooking. Add shredded cabbage to the broth in the slow cooker and cook on high until done. Put pork back into the slow cooker and mix everything. Serve on top of rice. Chili water as a condiment (or even just hot pepper sauce) is the true way to enjoy this ""broke da mout"" meal. P.S. Pork butt can be found in Asian grocery markets. Do not use shoulder!","Very good as per recipe. You have to try. A lot of people 'change' recipes and rate. Not me. Want to have some fun with a similar Kalua Pork as well? Cut the salt to 1 Tablespoon and, yes this sounds weird but it works perfectly, place 2 UNPEELED bananas with the tips cut off on top of the roast when you start the slow cooker. By the time the roast is done the bananas will have melted away and you simply remove the leftover banana skins for the trash. Yes it sounds weird and NO it does not impart a nasty banana taste. It works. Been serving it to rave reviews for over 30 years.",,,,,,,

157,"I liked the idea of such an easy dish, but I took the laziness a step further, when I make this (twice now and third time will be tonight), Just brown the meat and onion in a large pot, then drain and put it back in, add the rest of the ingredients and put a lid on it. 15 minutes later the cabbage is steamed, the rice is perfect and I just glop it in bowl with a dallop of sour cream. Must be the busy mom in me that gets so shortcutty! You can use chicken broth instead of beef.","This was really tasty! I read through a ton of reviews and two things stood out -- the dish needs more seasoning and it can become mushy when cooked 1-1/2 hrs. Taking that into consideration, I socked the seasoning to the meat/onion while it was browning -- salt & pepper, a lot of garlic, oregano and basil and a heavy dose of both red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper. Also sprinkled some of all those things over the cabbage I'd chopped (I estimate 10-12 cups, fairly large head). To avoid ""mushy"" cabbage, I gave the rice a head start -- added the tomato sauce & half the broth to the browned meat/onion, then stirred in the rice, turned the burner off and let it hang out for about 10-15 mins. I tossed it all together in a large bowl, poured into lasagna dish (way too much for 9x13) and baked covered for 50 mins. Excellent! Rice cooked perfectly and cabbage, while softened, still had a slight crunch. Try this one, and don't be afraid to add a LOT of seasonings! :)","I would like to say that if someone didn't like this receipe, that they did something wrong or they just don't like cabbage. I love this recipe! I found this recipe about a year ago and I have fixed it probaly 10 times since then. I usually fix it when we have company (because it makes so much)and everyone asks for a copy of the recipe. I usually add more tomato sauce than it calls for and I use one medium head of cabbage no matter what it weighs. I add more salt than it calls for and I add plenty of black pepper. It taste just like moms stuffed cabbage without all the work. Mom even says so!","I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious. It was so tasty I had to have a second helping. Like some of the others, I also cut the recipe in half, using 1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 an onion, 1/2 a large head of cabbage, 1 can of beef broth (14 oz), 2 cans (8 oz) of tomato sauce and 1 cup of rice. The only extra seasoning I added was salt. I turned up the temperature to 400 and found it was done in an hour. I will definitely be making this again!",This is so GOOD & EASY !!! I make it even simpler by putting it all in a crockpot...only use long cooking rice.,"This casserole was easy to make and delicious. I did add a variety of spices, as suggested in earlier reviews, including Worstechsire sauce, a dash of hot sauce, garlic and nutmeg and a little vinegar to draw out the tomatoes. I used ground turkey to reduce the fat, and, possibly due to using drier meat, needed to add another cup and a half of tomato sauce. I served it to company and they kept going back for 'just another bite' well after we left the table and took a copy of the recipe home with them. This recipe will make many appearances at my table.","I made this last night. I added some garlic powder and some pepper to the meat while it was cooking. I also cooked the onions with the meat. Stirred the rice into the pot with the meat and onions. In a large, deep, foil roasting pan, I put a layer of cabbage and covered that with the meat/rice mixture. I poured a cup of beef broth over the top and then added the spaghetti sauce on top of everything. Covered with foil, and baked for 45 minutes. After 45 min, I took it out of the oven, stirred it all together and then turned the oven down to 225 because I had to go out for an hour. When we came back and had a taste test, it was PERFECT. My BF loves my cooking, but he had 2 servings for his taste test, took some for his lunch today and wants me to make it again on the weekend! I haven't seem him rave like this in a long time. Thank you Nancy!!","Like a real cabbage roll, this recipe tastes better as leftovers, when the flavours have blended. I modified the recipe quantities quite a bit so that I wouldn't end up with 2 9x13 pans of the stuff. I guess I didn't cut back enough - I had a 6qt slow cooker full! I added more rice and broth (1.5 c rice, 3 c broth), some diced tomatoes (14 oz), and a dash of chili powder, as well. If you're going to slow-cooker this, you'll need about 6 hours on high, minimum, to cook the cabbage (I used 3 hours to start, and we crunched our way through supper the first nite!). This is excellent served with sour cream and/or a nippy cheddar sprinkled on top. Yummy!","This dish is fantastic. I made it last night for my family and they truly enjoyed it. Even my picky hubby liked it! I followed the recipe exactly, but I used a lasagna pan andsprinkled on a little pepper and garlic powder before baking. I baked it for the first hour, covered with foil at 350F. Then we had to go away!!! I turned the oven down to 250F and loosened the foil. It was done to a T when we returned home. I served mashed potatoes and bread with this meal and everyone raved about it. Daughter took the recipe home with her. Makes a lot!!! Great one-dish dinner with plenty left for lunches or another dinner. This would be a good dish to take to a pot-luck supper, etc. Hope you enjoy!","I took cyndib's advice and made the whole thing on the stovestop; worked like a charm!!! After browning the beef in my large stock pot, I added the rest of the ingredients except the cabbage. I brought it to a boil, reduced to a simmer, and put the cabbage on top of it all (didn't stir it). Put the lid on and let everything simmer for 15 minutes; cabbage was nicely steamed and rice got cooked. I halved the recipe since I only have a family of 3, and that was very easy to do. Overall I really liked the flavor, though I did add plenty of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 1Tb of brown sugar (to cut the tomato acidity). Nothing beats a homemade cabbage roll, but this was a good way to cheat :)","I used ground Turkey instead of ground beef for a healthier version. I added garlic and sauted it with the meat and onion. I also added paprika and oregano. It was really good and tasted even better the next day. This is a good, healthy way to incorporate cabbage in your diet, which is really good for you!","I decided to try this one again since I am usually very impressed with the recipes I try on this sight. I am an experienced cook and AGAIN tried this and folloed it and the cabbage was mushy and the flavors just weren't there. Needless to say, I will stick to REAL cabbage rolls since I have NEVER had a problem with them.","Used V8 juice in the place of tomato sauce. Added a clove of minced garlic. Also used a bag of shredded cabbage as a shortcut. Tasted great, will have again. Thanks !","Awesome, although I too made some changes! Boiled cabbage for 2 mins first, cooked brown rice ahead, added 6 oz of beef broth instead, and added more tomato sauce! Last time I made this, it took forever and the rice was still crunchy, so I made these changes, and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD and alot quicker! Yummm! Oh, I also added some hot sauce and garlic..excellent flavors! I wanted to add that I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for a family of 5.","Great recipe but I have some tips for making it simpler. First, instead of chopped cabbage, I buy a 1 pound bag of pre-made slaw in the produce section of my grocery store. Next, my kids like tomato soup, so I substitute two cans of that with 1 can of water. I brown the ground beef with onion, drain off fat. Place the slaw and rice in 13x9 pan - then the ground beef, then pour the soup mix over all. I cover it with foil to bake.","I loved this. Easy to put together, I halved it since the full recipe was too much for 2 of us. I seasoned my meat and then did not add salt and used 1/2 diced tomatoes and 1/2 tomatoe sauce cause my dad used to make cabbage rolls that had chunks of tomato in the sauce. I also cooked it about 10 more minutes to make sure the cabbage was just right! Thanks!","This is an ok weeknight meal. Based on prior reviews, I halved the recipe and browned the beef w/the onion and some minced garlic. After draining the meat mixture, I added a can of diced tomatoes, a can of tomatoe sauce, 1/2 cup brown rice, and about 3/4 of a head of cabbage to the same pot and simmered covered for about 20 minutes. I'm not sure if the cabbage is ""supposed"" to be soft, but I like it w/a little ""crunch"" still, those this worked out well. I also added a dash of Worchestershire sauce, a dash of garlic powder, & a dash of Italian seasonings for some flavor. Served w/a dollop of fat-free sour cream and a sprinkle of 2% cheese.","I halved the meat, precooked the rice, add minced garlic to meat mixture, sprinkle with salt & pepper, used tomato juice (like my Mom used in regular cabbage rolls), steamed the cabbage leaves(devein center stem) for 1 or 2 minutes, and lastly added 1 can of-- sauerkraut (like my Mom did), rinsed and drained. I think the sauerkraut really makes this taste like cabbage rolls I had for supper growing up in NJ.","This is a cheap (less than $10.00) and great recipe IF you like cabbage. Note that this serves 12 so unless you want to freeze or throw away you might want to scale it to feed 6. If you don't scale the recipe you will need two pans to bake in as all ingredients won't fit in one. I used roasted garlic tomato sauce, beef broth w/ onion, and browned my beef with the onion instead of mixing it after. The only thing this recipe lacks is seasoning. If you season properly you will be happy. Vinegar, Worcestire sauce, garlic-onion-chili powder, cumin, and a dash of hot sauce are some suggestions. Also, once you remove the cover I would suggest stirring frequently to avoid the cabbage getting dry and burning on the top layer. Many people mentioned their rice not cooking. I poured in one bag of Uncle Ben's rice in a bag (1 cup even though I scaled the recipe) and my rice was completely cooked. Again, I scaled the recipe which could be why mine was cooked...I can't imagine throwing double all in one pan and thinking the rice would be done??",Tried this tonight. What a hit. Thank you for posting this.,My husband doesnt really care for casseroles but will eat the whole pan of this one himself. I always half the recipe as this will fill 2 9x13 pans as is. I also use tomato soup as my sauce I mix it in with the cabbage mixture and save a can to pour over the top. Tastes just like my grandmothers. Thanks.,"I halfed the recipie and it made plenty to fill a 9x12 dish. After only an hour it was done, I was worried the cabbage wouldn't cook like some reviews said but it was completely soft. It could use a little more flavor, next time I will add chili powder to give it a boost. I didn't think it had enough tomato sauce so I added a can of chopped tomatoes which was nice. Will make again with my revisions!","This was good, but it needed a little kick. Cheese or some spice would have perked it up. It was good but I will experiment with it.","This recipe is excellent! I added a can of drained tomatoes, garlic, and italian seasoning. I would also recommend cutting this one in half. It makes a lot of food.","I can’t believe I have been making stuffed cabbage rolls for years and never thought of this, so much easier!! It is exactly the same except all mixed together. YUM My modifications – sautéed the onion with the meat, garlic salt, onion powder, pinch Italian spices and Worcestershire sauce. ½ to 6 servings for my needs.","My mother always made cabbage rolls when I was growing up. We lived in a Polish town in Western Pennsylvania so cabbage rolls and pierogies are a family classic. Anyway, I don't have the time to make cabbage rolls now that I'm married so I decided to try this recipe. When I did, it just didn't taste right so I called my mom. She says instead of the tomato sauce use spaghetti sauce and tomato juice. So whatever amount the recipe calls for in tomato sauce, substitute that for half of each (i say whatever because i know most of us half this recipe). It gives the sauce a little more flavor and reminds me of my mother's cabbage rolls. This might help for those that said they didn't like the sauce. I also cooked the rice and boiled the cabbage prior to baking and it turned out really well.","Excellent meal! I used 3 cheese blend tomato sauce and per other reviews, used an extra 14oz can. I used the pre-packaged, pre-shredded cabbage (1 1/2 bags = appx 1.5lbs) and an extra 1/2 cup of rice. This was sooo easy to make and very tasty! As my roommate said ""this is an A+ meal""...thus a keeper in my book! Thanks Nancy.",,,,,,,,,

160,"This recipe is great, and making it is about as easy as falling off a log. You need to know some things though, so yours will turn out wonderfully, like mine does every time i make this recipe. First of all, the pork should be relatively pink when it is done. This is due to the fact that it was swimming in Burgundy Red Wine. Be sure to use a meat thermometer and bring the temp to 160, and if any of your guests complains that they think they are going to get trichanosis, politely ask them to leave and go to applebees where they process and overcook everything. Next, I am not sure how this recipe was called Burgundy Pork Tenderloin and it calls for red wine. Be sure to use BURGUNDY red wine, as the title suggests. The fun thing about burgundy is that there is no such thing as an expensive burgundy wine. It is usuall near the mogen david and other cheap wines. Don't bother changing the Bbrown gravy amount. Also, the first time I made this I thought I would be smart and braise the roast first to make it more tender. The next time I made it I just threw all the ingredient into the pan as the recipe suggests and it came out way better. It takes about five minutes to construct this recipe and it is the best I have ever found. Have fun!","This is my all time favorite recipe. I've been making it for the past two years now and figured it's about time that I finally rate it. I've learned to omit the onions and the celery as they really don't improve the taste beyond the seasonings. Also, this means that I don't have to strain out the onion and celery from the wine before making the gravy, I can just take the loin out to rest on a cutting board and put the pan right on top of the stove with the wine still in it to make the gravy. I use two packages of gravy mix as I serve this with quartered red potatoes tossed with butter and parsley and baked alongside the pork (which the gravy goes well with) and with the PAN-FRIED ASPARAGUS (Recipe on the site). It's wonderful. You must try if you haven't already.","This was EXCEPTIONAL, make no mistake - it's great. But make sure to use fresh (not previously frozen) tenderloin. I had 4 tenderloins (3lbs) which I marinated for 1 hour in a ¼ cup of olive oil and ½ cup of white wine, combined with one small bunch of chopped green onions, and 2 small peeled anneheim peppers (chopped), 5 cloves of crushed garlic, and a fair bit of fresh ground pepper (approx. 3tbs). After tranfering the meat and marinade to the roasting dish, I covered everything with 2 cups of freshly sliced small brown mushrooms, 2 cups of red wine (Valpolicella), and one cup of beef broth. I turned the meat after 25 minutes and stuck a thermometer into one of the larger pieces and waited until the temp got to 155°F. I removed them immediately (the real issue with this is, don't over cook). I covered the meat with foil and let sit while I transfered everything that was remaining into a sauce pan and made the gravy. I used a little flour and some beef soup mix. When the gravy was done, I sliced the tenderloins into ½ inch thick slices and served with fresh garden beans and mashed red potatoes (skin left on and seasoned to taste). The gravy and the tenderloin were to die for. Enjoy! Just one more thing. Make sure to serve on warm plates so that you can take your time to enjoy this fabulous dish.","OUCH, way to much wine.... Reduced the wine by 1 cup and subbed low sodium beef broth the second time around. Used fresh minced garlic vs powder and seared the pork prior to baking as it makes a much better presentation when finished. Added baby brown bella mushrooms to the pork while baking and used 2 packages of pork gravy mix. One tip I'd like to share: Smaller tenderloins are easier to cook and monitor to prevent dryness ~ some pink in the middle of pork is fine unlike the old wives tales we have all heard for years.... Very tasty dish!","I am only 13 and am an aspiring chef, so I try to cook for my parents and sister (they are kind of like my recipe guinea pigs) my sister is also an EXTREMELY picky eater, and even she loved it, so far I haven’t found one person who didn’t like it. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone. P.S. make more red wine mix than advised and make with mashed potatoes, the gravy wine mixture is great with mashed potatoes.","WOW!!!!!!!! I hesitated on this recipe because it sounded WAY TOO EASY to be that wonderful, but I was wrong. This is a definite keeper, I added portebella mushrooms and I seared the meat in a TB of olive oil and butter to give it a nice color, I found it was perfectly cooked in 45 min be sure to use a meat thermoter and do not over cook!! when it reaches 165 degrees take out and wrap in foil while making the gravy I used 2 cups of Merlot wine and got nervous it might be to much wine taste and added 1/2 CUP WATER so I did use 2 pkgs of Mccormick brown gravy and it was PERFECT a great recipe to impress guests or make for a large crowd, even my husband who really doesn't like pork thought it was FABULOUS my brother in law kept telling me what an awsome dinner rates 10 stars thank you for sharing!!!! I also used 2 1 lb tenderloins that is probably where some of you have had issues with evaporation because larger ones would take longer to cook, try using several small ones","I read all of the reviews before making this and never having made a pork tenderloin before was ready and willing to make any and all changes that other reviewers had suggested. We like meat braised in wine and I did not change that at all. You don't need an ""expensive"" red wine - I used a ""2 Buck Chuck"" Merlot from Trader Joes that is fine enough to drink as well. I did sear the pork first because I was fearful of a pale white piece of meat and I was glad I did ( the meat is not red if you sear it first by the way) - the meat was so tender - don't be afraid of a quick hot sear on both sides after seasoning - maybe 2 minutes top each side. I sauteed some onions ( thinly sliced ) just because this recipe was so fast and I had time so I threw them in the pan with the pork for a little extra zip -- if I had mushrooms in the house I would have done that too -- next time I will. I doubled the gravy mix because we are gravy people too. This was OUT OF THIS WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stock up the freezer when these babies are on sale - it's a no brainer - the quickest after work dinner I have made in a year !!!!!!!!!! Thank you Kathleen - this is a keeper in this house !","My guests loved this recipe. It really helps to read the reviews before cooking. I seared the meat first, used 1c burgundy wine and 1c beef broth, deleted the celery, added mushrooms, chopped the onions,added 2pks of pork gravy mix to the wine sauce and put the sauce in a pan and brought it to a boil. It thickened beautifully.","This is very good, one thing I ALWAYS do with any cut of meat I intend to roast in the oven is to brown it first on the stove, otherwise the meat has a very light and unappealing color. Add salt, pepper, garlic salt to the pork, brown all sides in oil or butter, or both. Transfer to the baking pan with the wine/broth mixture. I do agree that you must cut the wine down and add beef broth. I can see why some people said it tasted to strongly of wine, this will help that problem. For an added touch, saute mushrooms in the pan you browned the pork in then pour over the finished dish. Very tasty.","I made a double recipe of this for a family dinner for my parents' anniversary. We added mushrooms to the veggies and it was WONDERFUL!! I cooked it at 375 to go along with the potato side dish I was cooking. It took about 1 1/2 hours to cook, but was WELL worth the wait. Definitely the best pork dish I have ever tasted, even from restaurants. The meat was so tender and juicy. This is such a simple recipe- very easy to make- and such a crowd pleaser that I'm sure we will be making this often for when company comes over.",I served this to some of the harshest food critics I know-my parents! I made two of these and there was none left!,"Easy & Delicious. Took advice from others: salt & peppered then seared the tenderloin in a little oil, then placed in the baking dish.(I was able to purchased just under a pound of the tenderloin). To the frying pan I added 3 cloves of fresh crushed garlic, sliced onion and chopped celery and mushrooms. I sauted for a few minutes, then added a little of the wine/broth mixture to the pan, heated for a few minutes then added all over the tenderloin. Covered with foil and cooked just under 35 min. Turned the meat over half way through cooking time as suggested. Inside temp. of meat registered 170F. Let it set for awhile and it was absolutely moist and delicious. Took advice and use 1/2 c. Pinot Noir wine and 1/2 c. broth. I did not make gravy as the small amount of liquid and the juices from the meat was all that was needed. Thanks for all the reviews and especially to Browndog for the recipe. This is a keeper. Going to have my students make it in class next week. Those of you that are saying it is too salty, DOUBLE CHECK to be sure you are using Garlic Powder and NOT Garlic SALT and check the sodium content on the pkg. of gravy. This is the only way it can be too salty! The amount of salt in the recipe is not much for 2 pounds of pork tenderloin and don't add extra salt at the table.","OMG - this is the best pork recipe I've ever made (or eaten)! I used the advice of some and used 1 cup wine and 1 cup water, instead of 2 cups wine. I also eliminated the veggies and used 2 packs of gravy mix instead of 1. Great results! My husband LOVED it and even my finicky 4 yr old ate the meat. It's SO easy to prepare and to clean up! Highly recommended!",Great recipe!!! Took the advice of other reviews and browned in pan before I put it in the oven. I also used 1 cup of red wine and 1 can of beef broth. Turned out perfect!!! Thanks for the recipe!,"I read the reviews thoroughly before making this recipe. I too decided to use less wine, some beef broth and water. I'm not quite sure of the proportions, other than the fact that I used a little less than a cup of wine all in all. Then probably a half of water, and a half of broth. I must stress that you need to make the gravy according to the package! If it calls for 1 cup water, use 1 cup of the wine/meat juice mixture to keep the proportions correct so it actually turns out like gravy. You may want to double the gravy recipe so there is enough. I also added 8 red potatoes rubbed in olive oil and sea salt to the dish. I covered the pan with foil before baking, and it was done perfectly in 45 minutes. This meal turned out amazing, celery and all. I didn't use Burgundy wine either, I used Cabernet Sauvignon because that's all I had...a pretty strong/dry wine. Next time I will try the burgundy and see if there's really a taste difference.","I'm sorry to leave such a poor review when the recipe got so many raves. The taste, however, wasn't very good, and it looked extremely unappealing. After cooking in burgundy wine, the pork took on an unappetizing grayish purple color. The sauce turned a dark blackish purple when I added the brown gravy mix. The ""purple"" meat with ""black sauce"" reminded me of orc carnage from Lord of the Rings.","Just had this for dinner tonight and all I can say is ""Wow-Wee-Ka-Zow-Wee!"" One of the best recipes I've tried from this site, and I have literally tried hundreds! I served it with egg noodles and it was superb. This one deserves more than 5 stars... It was quick to put together and came out tasting like I had been slaving in the kitchen for hours. Even my husband raved about it and he's not one to give up compliments very easily! Thank you for submitting this one; we LOVED it!","I loved this! I put it in the slow cooker this morning and just added 2 cups of beef broth with it to make sure it was covered. 9 hours later, it was absolutely perfect.","Very good! BF says it's the 2nd best thing I've made!!! The gravy has a WONDERFUL taste - not your run of the mill ""tenderloin with brown gravy"". Certainly guest-worthy. Here's what I did to suit my / our palates: a) omitted celery, b) seasoned tenderloin (mine was approx. 1.5 lb. for 2 ppl. - w/ leftovers) w/ fresh cracked black pepper & celery salt to taste, c) cut slits in meat & filled with fresh minced garlic (~ 2 cloves), d) seared in 1 T EVOO (2 min. per side on med-high heat), e) sauteed onion in remaining oil until soft, f) topped with onions, a couple rosemary sprigs & a drizzle of EVOO & g) poured mixture of 1 c. Pinot Noir & 1 c. low-sodium beef broth over all. Covered w/ aluminum foil & baked at 350 degrees (in a greased 9x13 in. dish) for 45 min. (as suggested - add'l. time not needed) to an internal temp. of 160 degrees. My tenderloin was nicely browned (not purple from the wine as some have warned), even tho I did not turn it 1/2 way thru. Marinating beforehand is NOT necessary (I can see how it might ""stain"" the meat). For the gravy, I poured wine / broth mixture (w/ cooking juices) into a sm. saucepan, added packet of brown gravy called for & brought to a boil. Reduced heat, stirring constantly until thickened (it thickened nicely). Not too wine-y : ) Served wtih mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus & the remaining wine, of course! Thx!","Based on other reviews, I did the following: I used 1 1/4 lbs for 2 people. First I sliced small pockets into the meat and stuffed them w/minced garlic. Then I rubbed it w/Montreal Steak seasoning. I browned it and then baked it for approx 1 hr @ 400 degrees or until internal temp was 160 degrees. For the sauce I used 1 cup wine, 1 cup beef broth, 1/2 package mushroom gravy mix and 1/4 sliced onion. I did have to use corn starch to thicken the sauce. Absolutely no leftovers!!!","My boyfriend is also not a huge fan of pork, and he said he could eat this once a week. I also added mushrooms,used half red wine and half beef stock, and served with mashed potatoes. Agree with previous review about the unappealing gray color. Will definitely brown the pork on stove before baking next time.",This was great!! Looked at many reviews and took some advice from others to brown the pork a bit on the skillet to give it color and used fresh onions & fresh garlic instead. Did not use celery and did use 2 packets of gravy mix but make sure you really mix it in well or else it gets lumpy and very thick the gravy...Add a little water to mix it better if wish,"I generally prefer my pork tenderloin smoked with some chutney on the side. I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe--it didn't seem like the combination of ingredients would be that good, but it turned out wonderfully! I would rate this 10 stars just for how easy it was to make. On top of that, the flavor was savory and delectable. Both my fiance and I thoroughly enjoyed it...will definitely make again. Served w/ mashed potatoes & green beans w/ almonds. Used a Cabernet Sauvignon since that's what we had on hand, and did not use the celery or onions...just rubbed the meat w/ Greek Spices, poured the wine over, and baked...tasty and easy--gotta love that!","This will be a repeat recipe. The flavor was very good. As stated by other reviewers, be sure to sear the meat to seal in the juices. I'm sure it would be dry otherwise. I suggest you double all ingredients relating to the gravy because a lot of it evaporates while cooking. I hardly had enough gravy for one person left after cooking. I also used 1/2 wine and 1/2 broth. I don't like a heavy wine taste and this was perfect. This recipe is easy and flavorful so I highly recommend trying it.","Great recipe. I've made my tenderloin like this for several years with two exceptions. First I marinate the meat overnight and sear it in a hot pan with a little oil before putting it in the oven. This helps keeps all the juices in the meat. Second, I add beef broth as other reviews have suggested. Thanks for sharing!","Excellent. The suggestion to serve with mashed potatoes was a great one- the gravy is very good with it. I seared the tenderloin before adding the vegetables and wine- it didn't really end up with a ""purple"" color that way. Since I seared it, I also cut down the oven time to 35 minutes. We will be making this often!","Thank-you Kathleen! I made this pork tenderloin last evening (following the exact recipe) and I must agree with 99% of the other reviwers, it is delicious!!! I certainly can't see where the other 1% found fault. Using a 'good' red wine might help those who thought it was too winey. The only thing I would change next time is using brown gravy mix. It was my first experience with brown gravy mix and my last. I was able to doctor up the sauce to make it edible but maybe using something like Knorr's Bernaise Sauce might be better. Or as another reviewer mentioned just thickening the wine and pan juices with cornstarch. Since I had opened a nice Cabernet for the cooking (and had the rest with dinner), the basis of the sauce was quite yummy and I probably should have went with a thickener. Five Stars for sure on the pork. Has anyone ever tried making this with port? Maybe that will be my next attempt, as I do LOVE port!",,,,,,,,,
161,"I would actually give this a 4.75, only because I found the lasagna to be very watery. Next time I would cut down on the broth. Great tasting, though, and leftovers just as good or better. I used homemade veg broth, which I do for everything. Very easy to make -- just keep all the ends of veggies that you have in a bag in the freezer (carrot ends, broccoli stalks, onion bits, etc). When you have enough to fill a pot, cover them with water and boil until the veggies have basically nothing left! Drain and keep the ""broth."" You can compost or throw out the soggy veggies, and then freeze the broth for when you need it. Great way to recycle old bits of veggies, and couldn't be healthier or more natural!","This recipe was wonderful! Some changes I made include: fresh basil instead of rosemary, fresh spinach instead of frozen, and alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce. I also added chopped portobella mushrooms and a ricotta layer made up of ricotta cheese, 1 egg, mozzarella cheese, fresh parsley, and salt and pepper. I used no-cook noodles to counteract the amount of liquid that the other reviewers talked about. This came out AWESOME! Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again. So creamy and delicious!","I have made this recipe now several times, and it always comes out perfect. Even people who hate spinach love this recipe. I have found that no matter what type of noodles you use, you don't have to boil them with this recipe.","Excellent. I sauteed the onion & garlic in a little olive oil instead of Pam for more flavor and didn't bother to spray the baking pan. With the sauce in the bottom of the pan, the lasagna didn't stick. I substituted a little oregano for the rosemary (I guess you could substitute a little basil too), used whole wheat lasagna noodles and, per one reviewer's recommendation, used a jar of (Classico) portobello mushroom sauce. Instead of the frozen spinach, I substituted a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach which I just washed, drained, & chopped into slightly smaller pieces. Although I did chop the artichokes a bit, I'd chop them a little smaller next time. Just a note - this lasagna isn't high (like you'd think of for a meat lasagna). If you'd like it higher, you could probably double the recipe, except for maybe the feta that you sprinkle on top.","I made this for an ultra-picky friend once, and need to make it again soon. It's a GREAT variation on the typical meat lasagna. My only changes were to use a home-made sauce, and I never boil my noodles first. I always use regular, dry noodles, and just make sure I've included enough sauce to boil the noodles as the lasagna cooks. The result is a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well, without mushy noodles.","This was so good. I used no boil lasagna noodles and left the artichokes whole and added the juice as well. I also used one bag of fresh prewashed spinach instead of frozen.And I added some ricotta when I layered. I've made it several times, it's a keeper.",WOW!! David..please tell me you have more than just this one recipe to share with us. This was an amazing Lasagna. The flavors blend together so well. I only used about 1/2 a cup of broth (I like mine a little on the thick side) and crushed about 1/2 a tsp of dried rosemary since I didn't have the fresh. I added 1/4 a cup of whipping cream to the sauce..to give it a pink look. This is truly a gourmet dish. You could even omit the broth and noodles all together and use this as a dip with french bread. I plan on passing this one along...thanks for sharing!!,"Loved this unique lasagna and it was even better the next day! Used no-cook noodles, fresh spinach, a 32 oz jar of sauce (which it really needed) & regular artichoke hearts instead of marinated. The only thing I would probably do differently next time is to use less rosemary since 1 Tb. was a bit overpowering.","This was fabulous! I couldn't find vegatable broth so I used chicken broth. I also used a 16 oz jar of sun dried tomatoe alfredo sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. After the jar was emptied I filled it up with about 3/4 c of water, shook it and added it to the rest of the mixture. I also drained the artichoke hearts juice into the mixture. This was a BIG hit at my dinner party.","I have been making this lasanga for years, it was a recipe from a Betty crocker cookbook. My version uses garlic Alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce. You have to try it this way! The Alfredo goes perfectly with the spinach and artichokes. Also, you don't need to cook the noodles first. They will cook when you bake the lasanga. This is a really great recipe that everyone I have made it for loves!","This recipe is fantastic! For those reviewers that complained about it being too watery at the end, an easy fix is to just not cook the noodles at all. Put the lasagna noodles in dry and they will soak up the liquid as they cook. I wouldn't change a thing in here. Do yourself a favor and make this as written the first time before you try any modifications, it's really good!","I love artichokes. I love spinach. I love lasagna. So I thought I'd love this recipe, but I didn't. It came out the perfect consistency, not watery like some reviewers, it was just very bland. I had even added extra spices. It seems like some of the reviewers that really liked it added a major ingredient, like ricotta or chicken. Won't be making again. **UPDATE** There was most of the pan left over, because nobody really liked it, and I will say that the leftovers reheated actually taste much better than the first day--even enough to maybe call it 4 stars.","This was just okay, nothing too special for all the work it took to prepare it.","Impressed! One reviewer commented on how skimpy it was so I kept everything the same except decreased the noodle amount to 6 and put it into an 8x8 dish. I used only 8oz homemade veggie stock, I used non-marinated artichoke hearts, added chopped fresh basil, dried rosemary, and thyme to the mixture, 7oz of fresh spinach, and regular feta (added a little basil, oregano, garlic powder to it). It was wonderful! My 2.5 year old had 4 servings at dinner then the next day for lunch had 2 servings. I think this will become our regular lasagna dish from here on out. Others suggested alfredo sauce instead, it doesn't need it! Just think of all the extra calories you save by using a tomato based sauce!","This lasagna was great!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the broth down to 8oz. I also added some oregano b/c i love the flavor and used fresh spinach. When i simmered the onion/garlic/artichoke/spinach mix w/ the broth, i left the lid off the pan to burn off some of the liquid. I used one 24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and then added one can (15 oz) of tomato sauce. I also did NOT pre-cook the noodles - they turned out perfect. There is plenty of liquid to boil the noodles as the lasagna cooks. I also did not find that there was too much liquid (maybe b/c i reduced the broth). My husband is already asking me to make this lasagna again.","A girlfriend and I made this for New Year's Eve for our husbands as a special dinner. We added shredded chicken and a little alfredo to make it ""pink"". It was heavenly. I never eat my own leftovers, and this one I couldn't wait for. The spinach is wonderful fresh, and the marinated artichokes are much better than the canned ones. Make sure you have a deep dish, though, as it does grow in the oven.","With a few changes, this was a fantastic recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and opted out of boiling the noodles in favor of soaking them in hot water until I was ready to bake--they came out perfectly al dente. I also added a layer of ricotta mixed with parsley and mozzarella, which was a great touch. I'm only giving this four stars because it definitely needed some tweaking: in the future, I'll add slightly less vegetable broth, and whatever you do LEAVE OUT THE ROSEMARY. It overpowered all of the other flavors in the dish and nearly ruined it. I'll use basil next time. Other than that, this was a great dish and a great ""quick"" lasagna recipe, especially with the herb and garlic feta on top! I'll definitely be making this again.","I just made this for my ""nerd club"" aka book club and everyone RAVED about it. It had to be hands down one of the best lasagna's I have ever made, meat or no meat. It came out picture perfect and tasted even better! I did follow the other's suggestions: 1. I used no bake lasagna noodles 2. 1/2 the amount of vegetable broth 3. Cooked fresh spinach 3. 1/2 cup half and half to sauce 4. Ricotta layer above the noodles and before the mozzarella. I used about 16 oz ricotta, 1 egg, mozzarella, parsley and salt and pepper to taste. This will be a keeper and is definitely going into the permanent recipe box....WE LOVED IT! Thanks for sharing!!","This recipe is really spectacular-- tangy and bursting with flavor. Guaranteed to be a hit, with requests for the recipe. *Like others, I find this dish a bit watery, so I reduce the vegetable broth by almost 1/2 and I do not boil the noodles. This results in a firm lasagna, which is my preference. I make a few other changes. *I add a cheese layer of ricotta, one egg, and minced fresh parsley. *I make the tomato sauce with Allrecipe's Best Marina Sauce Ever, and I truly think that this makes a massive difference. That sauce is exceptional, super easy, and probably costs bit less than many jarred sauces. *I use 5- 6 oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen. *In addition to the fresh rosemary, I add 10- 15 fresh basil leaves, and about 1T of a mix of fresh oregano, thyme, and sage. *My prep time is closer to 45 min than 20-- and totally worth it. *I find that this serves 8 adults with average appetites, when served with a salad and bread. Expect this to serve only 6 hungry adults, or 4- 5 teenager boys.","I used less cheese, more spinach, and added carrots, zuchini, and green peppers. This was very very good!","I know everyone hates it when you adapt a recipe and rate it, but I made the alfredo version, and it rocked. Added also 1 heaping tsp on sundried tomato 'pesto' to it, more black pepper, more garlic, and yum. Also added that ricotta layer. So delicious. Not low-fat, but good for a nice treat once in awhile, and at least no bad fats (I made my own alfredo - not from a jar or can). Also, I indulge in pasta so infrequently, I always put a doulbe layer of the uncooked noodles. Came out perfect, and beyond restaurant quality.","Very tasty. The only changes I made were 1:not to cook the noodles ahead of time (should have, at least to where they started getting soft, because they were slightly firmer than I like) 2:used water and beef bullion in place of vegetable broth, tasted fine. 3: used 2 standard jars of alfredo sauce (a bit more than 28oz, but the extra moisture was good for the uncooked noodles). This was a great recipe that I will make again. Leftovers were gone in 1 day (and were better than the original)","I followed the directions and suggestions of most: add some ricotta on the layers, sub basil for rosemary, don't pre-cook the noodles, and added some extra mozzarella. It just didn't turn out well at all. There was so little ""sauce"" that the noodles remained pretty al dente and it was really dry. There wasn't enough sauce to fully cover each layer of noodles. I don't know what I did wrong but I won't be making this again.","If I could give this recipe 100 stars I would! This is the BEST lasagna I have ever tasted and I love how you don't even miss the meat. VERY satisfying and delicious. The only change I made was using fresh spinach rather than frozen. I could eat this every day and never tire of it. Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!!!!","This is a wonderful recipe. Instead of mixing the artichoke/spinach mixture with red sauce, I mixed it with jarred alfredo and added shredded rotisserie chicken. Then, I added a red sauce in between layers with the mozzarella. GREAT! I will definitely make this again and again, especially for guests.","Excellent! Instead of a jar of spaghetti sauce I roasted a pan of roma tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil and garlic. I also saved all the juices from the tomatoes. I also had fresh baby spinach that I used in place of the frozen spinach. Since my family doesn't like feta cheese I opted for parmesan reggiano cheese. Also, I did not boil my lasagna noodles. I layered the uncooked noodles in between the artichoke mixture, liquid and cheese. I was careful when adding the liquid so as not to end up with too much liquid. The baking time is approximate for the lasagna. I can see the cheese bubbling as well as the liquid in the bottom of the pan. The liquid/broth cooked all of the lasagna noodles and did not stick when lifting it out of the pan. There are fresh flavors in each bite. It is hearty and delicious. The tomatoes, spinach and artichoke all works well in this dish. What I like best is that there is no meat, just fresh vegetables, tomatoes and herbs. I ate this with, ""Michael's Foccacia Bread,"" also from this website.","My favorite lasagna! I've made it over a dozen times and now make the following adjustments. 1) Don't boil the noodles first. 2) Use 12 oz cooked fresh spinach vs frozen. 3) Use 3/4 onion chopped finely. Thanks for a great recipe, I can't eat meat lasagnas now, this is sooo good!","Amazing! I'm trying to convert our diet to less meat and am looking for some vegetarian main course recipes that are filling, yummy, and balanced. This one is at the top of my list! I presoaked no-boil noodles in hot water for ten minutes while preparing the filling. Followed the recipe for the veggie filling, using two bags of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I used fresh rosemary and added 2 Tbs of fresh basil. For the cheese, I used the more traditional lasagna filling which is ricotta, mozzarella, and one egg mixed together. Newman's Marinara sauce is perfect in this recipe and brought the flavors all together. Everyone loved this dinner!",Used less broth as suggested by other reviews. Did not boil the noodles at all which scared me but it was amazing! Not too soggy at all. A big hit!,,,,,,,
162,"As submitter of this recipe, I would like to make the following comments based on the reviews that I have read. Many of the reviews state that it is too salty; I admittedly love salt so the amount of salt may indeed be too much for some. I would point out that if you are using table salt to cut the amount of salt in 1/2. Many users also ask if this is good on other cuts of meat, I use it on all cuts of meat (beef and pork) especially roast. For poultry, I might suggest replacing the oregano with sage.","This is the First sirloin tip roast that I have made that turned out to excel in flavor and texture. I have tried many times before to make a tip roast with them all ending up to be tough and dry. Your recipe produced comments by all, that it tasted just like prime rib! It was tender and juicy and flavorful. It turned out excellent! The recipe is called herb, but it is more on the spicy side...not overwhelming though. I did follow the recipe to a T...however I put the spice rub on and let the meat come to room tempature before baking. After an hour of cooking, I checked the meat for internal tempature of 140 degrees (rare) and when it reached that temperature, I turned off the oven and allowed it to sit another 15 to 30 minutes in the oven to produce medium rare. Came out excellent!! Thank you very much for sharing this excellent recipe!","Very, very good. The meat turned out moist and tender. I cooked mine in the crockpot for 6 hours on low and 1 hour on high. The spices were wonderful.","This was truly delicious! I substituted fresh chopped garlic for the garlic powder and lowered the temp a bit. I had a 5 pound roast so I dropped the temp to 325 and cooked it for about an hour. (Until the temp reached 135), then I rested it while I made the gravy and mashed the potatoes. This roast produced one of the best gravies I've ever made. I cooked it on a rack in a shallow baking pan and put a can of beef broth and a couple of bay leaves underneath it. While the beef rested I strained the broth into a butter roux. (The broth had concentrated and it was a little salty so I added about 1/2 cup of water.) The resulting gravy was delicious. I'll definitely use this rub again. Thanks for a great recipe!","I used a 3 lb tri tip roast for the meat. Combined the ingredients and put the roast in a big baggie and put the rub all over it and let it marinate in the fridge for 4 hours. Cooked it on my grill using the indirect method for about 36 minutes. You have to let it rest for 10 minutes or so. But oh my god!!!! We all just LOVED it. The meat was so juicy and tender and so very very tasty!! If I could, I would have given this 10 stars!!! Served it with potato salad and fresh corn on the cob. SCRUMPTIOUS!!","very tasty! i needed to cook it less time, though... i like it medium rare. i followed the directions but it kinda got too well done. my parents used to cook a roast at 200 degrees, one hour per pound and it came out perfecto. i shall try this rub with their timing next time. I loved that I had all the ingredients to this rub! thanx","This is such a good combination of spices! I use it for more than just this particular recipe, too: One variation I enjoy, particularly, is to add a couple tablespoons of flour to the mixture, then I braise the meat shortly before putting it into the oven to cook; the ""blackened"" crust that forms on the roast is second only to the amazing gravy that comes from the drippings. My fiance and his brother will never be able to eat at home anymore because I've outdone their mom...","The best rub I've ever made. Followed it to a tee but used 1/2 T of table salt instead of 1 T kosher. Used a 2 lb tri tip roast at 350 for 45 minutes (until 140 degree internal), turned off heat, let sit for 15 minutes, remove from oven, cover with foil, and sit another 10 minutes. Came out perfectly medium rare.","I love rubbed roasts, and mixing the herbs and spices with olive oil ensures the flavors will stick. The 15 min. rest time allows dried herbs to swell, the oil to absorb flavors, and helps make all very easily spreadable. This roast comes out exactly medium rare, the way we like it. An instant-read meat thermometer is essential, especially when roasting for guests.","All I can say is YUM! I used minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and added some celery seed. I roasted it with carrots, celery, onion, cauliflower, asparagas, and red pepper and a splash of port to keep the veggies from drying out. It was wonderful! Thanks for the great recipe!","Sirloin Tip is a lovely cut of beef, inexpensive, and if prepared properly, tender and flavorful. It's like a cross between bottom sirloin and bottom round, quite similar to rump roast. I've read that it's not really sirloin properly speaking, and since it's so lean it can be tough if cooked at high temps. Low, slow and medium rare is best, just like rump roast. However, I must concur with another reviewer here - NO crock pot please! A slow cooker will make this into pot roast, and there are much better (and even cheaper) cuts for that, like chuck. Sirloin Tip can have a steak-like flavor and texture, and I think few of us would pass up steak in favor of pot roast! I've made this twice, first time as written, and the consensus is correct - it's more spicy than herby. It's like a spicier version of Linberg & Snider Porterhouse and Roast Seasoning. That's pretty high praise, and it can be a nice change of pace from that old standby. But just like that mix, it's better in moderation. Pasting it on is a bit much, and second time around I omitted the oil from the mixture and instead applied it directly to the roast, then dusted with the dry spices. MUCH better that way, IMHO. Then my standard Sirloin Tip prep - sear in a fry pan, browning all sides; insert an electronic in-oven thermometer into the thickest part and roast at 225F until the center reads 140F. Take it out and cover, let it sit for 15 minutes, slice thinly. Beef heaven!",For anyone thinking of making this in your slow cooker... DONT!! Cheap meats are for braising (pot roasting). Good cuts of meat like a sirloin are best with dry roasting- no liquid!,"For my roast cooking impaired self, this was super easy and turned out fantastic. The thing that needs emphasis, if there are others of you out there like me, is that this needs to be slice paper thin! We sliced it 1/4 inch thick and it was tough, but then tried it paper thin and it was just as tender as prime rib. For those of you that know you are supposed to slice this type of roast thin, sorry this is for the rest of the people out there like me that have no clue :) I followed the recipe to a tee, but only used 1/2 of the salt and half of the cayennne and it was still spicy (not the meat, but the gravy was). Also I put a cup of beef broth and a cup of water with a few bay leaves in the bottom of the pan while it roasted for the gravy. SUPER YUMMY!","excellent!!! I halved the cayenne (for the kiddos) and used some italian seasoning instead of oregano/thyme (crushing italian seasoning in the palm of my hand before adding, as it releases fresher flavor)We also used veggie oil as hubby detests EVO. I let a 6.5# sirloin roast marinate for about 6 hours in the fridge. Added quartered potatoes, sliced onion and beef broth to pan, put roast on small rack in middle, and foil wrapped the whole thing. then roasted in 325 oven for 2.5 hrs (didn't let meat get fully to room temp b4 roasting, only sat out 30 mins) OMG it was so delicious! It made the best au jus as well! whole family devoured it, and it's rare for everyone to agree on anything! next day we sliced remaining meat thin and warmed up in au jus and it made the greatest sandwiches! tytyty for a great recipe, and tytyty for this allrecipes community for great reviews that let originally clueless cooks like me make masterpieces such as this!","This is a keeper. I made a 5 1/2 lb roast on the Weber BBQ - indirect. Estimating 17 minutes a pound - it was wonderful. I let it rest, covered in foil for about 20 - 30 minutes to let the juices re absorb. It was tasty and tender. Thanks for a great recipe. BTW - if you are looking for a rare to medium rare roast - take it off at 130 and let rest. You won't be disappointed.","can you say ""wash the beef OFF please?"" once again i fall in the few--this was WAY too spicy. of course i used high quality paprika that is hot in itself. and i DID wash the beef rub off. 1 hour was also painfully short to cook. sorry--my mouth is burning and i feel a little unkind...","First time reviewing, but wanted to say the flavours were DELICIOUS. I ended up with a wee bit more cayenne than intended, so a minor extra kick. Substituted regular salt(1 1/2 tsp) since my kosher has gone missing. Baked the 1 hour, turned off and left for 15. Then another 5ish minutes on the cutting board with foil overtop. The temperature was a perfect medium-rare(our favourite), so obviously one would cook it a bit longer for more well done. Diners were myself, the hubby, and our 15 year old daughter. Two of our 4 children are open-minded eaters and she's one of them. RAVE REVIEWS! A long silence while they were devouring their plates. If we all had more room in our stomachs, and more meat leftover, we would have eaten more. Only little 'tip' of my own I would add is to put the meat fat-side up, if there is any fat on your roast. The fat melts away from the heat and goes down through the rest of the meat, making it -extra- juicy.","The spices in this rub are fabulous!! The roast was outstanding, it was juicy, and flavorful and cooked to perfection. We did a 12.5 lb roast and sliced the leftovers thin for sandwiches the next day and it was still tasty and not at all dry.","I got a 2lb sirloin tip on sale, reduced the spices to 2/3 of each and the salt to a half. I only use smoked sweet paprika and that gave it an amazing smokey scent and flavor.I left out the cayenne. I didn't have onion powder so I quartered a medium onion and threw it in a Pyrex dish with the roast and baked uncovered. I am concerned about cooking in/with aluminum. I make all my chicken and beef roasts in Pyrex dishes they don't require greasing or adding water either, the meat will give out it's own juices and it never sticks. I reduced the baking heat 25 degrees as you should with baking in Pyrex dishes and roasted it 30 minutes per lb because I prefer it medium. My roast came out tender and perfect and released about half a cup of delicious juice/gravy in the pan. Make sure to let it sit when done as indicated or else most of the inner juices will run out while cutting and your meat will end up being tough. Hubby gave it a thumbs up. He had to have a sandwich immediately! Overall we loved the herbs and spices and the roast was a great success. I also threw in some potatoes and eggplants to roast on the bottom rack :) nice sides to go with it. It's a keeper.","Very good. However, it took 1 hour and 1/2 just to get it to rare and probably another 15 minutes or so to get it to medium.",DELICIOUS The only thing I did different is what my Mother always did. Before I rub the meat with the seasonings I rub the entire piece of meat with gravy master or kitchen boquet it seals in the juices and makes a really nice gravy then I put the meat on a rack instead of sitting it directly on the bottom of the pan. I also mixed one package of dry onion soup with a 15 oz. can of beef broth and poured it into the bottom of the pan~ I kept an eye on this to make sure it does not dry out.If so add a small amount of water. I will always use this recipe it was awesome. Thank you,"The oven isn't really used in Japanese cuisine and my mother is Japanese and I sometimes live in Japan so I'm not that experienced at roasting meat. In fact, huge chunks of meat are not encountered in Asian cooking. So I always have trouble with ""doneness."" I like my meat rare--just de-horn it, wipe its rear and plate it. My BF likes it med-rare, so we need to compromise. I've made this roast a few times and I've had a devil of a time getting the doneness correct. One thing I've noticed about Americans is that they are too worried about meat safety issues ao they tend to cook things til they dry out, esp. chicken. Or maybe overzealous food safety nazis and corporations fearing litigation are the causes for skewed guidelines. So the guidelines and temperatures on doneness are way too high. If you want med rare, take this roast out at 125F on the meat thermometer. It will continue to cook after removal from the oven. This roast can increase in internal temperature very quickly so keep a careful eye on it. Since I apply the rub and insert garlic slits and leave overnight, I take it out a few hours before cooking to let it come to room temp before cooking to ensure even roasting.",I can't understand some of the less than shining reviews on this. This rub is awesome and so easy- I always have the ingredients. I didn't find it salty at all. The only thing I did was take down the cayenne because of the kids- not sure how much I actually did use. It smelled wonderful while cooking. I took it out at 140 and covered with foil for 15 minutes- sliced it thin was a great medium rare. Turned a cheap roast into a gourmet roast. Best part is that it wasn't stringy boiled slow cooker meat. Great with horseradish and a glass of wine. Thanks for sharing this gem...,Delicious! I did this in the slow cooker...,Sirloin tip roasts aren't exactly the most tender cuts of beef but they have a great flavor and this rub is the PERFECT compliment for this type of roast. The consistency of the rub is excellent and it doesn't overpower. I always cook a sirloin tip to 150 degrees and let it sit 15 minutes which gives the meat the perfect pink appearance. You don't want to overcook this beef or it will be EXTREMELY tough to chew. Also be sure to line the baking sheet with foil as per the recipe as some of the the drippings tend to really take hold while baking.,This is an awesome recipe! The rub was sooo good. I did like others and cut the salt down to my taste and glad I did. What's nice is you can cook it to your desired wellness. This recipe is a keeper.,,,,,,,,,,
163,"I have been making my corned beef and cabbage in the crockpot for a long time. I would rate this as the #1 best tasting food in the crockpot. I will let you all in on a little secret though. The only liquid you need to add is the water(about half to 3/4 to the top of the pot) You do not need beer, chicken broth or any other liquid for flavor. The only spice I would recommend is either the packet that comes with the corned beef or some whole peppercorns. Otherwise the meat will do all of the flavoring for you. Also, I always add my potatoes in the beginning along with the carrots and onion. They do not come out mushy at all, just very melt in your mouth tasty. You can leave them in larger pieces or you can use the small whole potatoes. Then for the last hour of cooking you can add your cabbage. Very simple meal but so delicious.",Really good-my family loved it. The only change I made was to cook it on low for 8 hours and then add the cabbage the last 1/2 hour of cooking. 8 hours on high seemed like the meat might get too tough.,"Amazingly simple, and amazingly delicious. The only changes I made were to set the slow cooker on low, instead of high. The meat came out tender and falling apart. I might put in the vegetables later on next time, but if you like stewy and smushy vegetables, then put it in the pot at the beginning. A solid hit! My boyfriend loved this dish, and it made leftovers for the two of us for a week!","I loved this because I can put it all in the crock pot first thing in the morning, go about my day and have a wonderful completed meal when I return home at 5pm. Few observations: the recipe definitely meant to say 8 hours on LOW, I can't imagine how it would have turned out otherwise, nor can I think of any crock pot recipe that is cooked THAT long on high. Secondly, use beef broth instead of water, it gives that much more flavor. Finally, I took out the roast and let it rest for 20 minutes and threw the cabbage in. It was perfectly cooked in the 20 minutes and not soggy at all.","I made this recipe for my first ever St. Patties with my new hubby. After reading many reviews, I decided it was too basic and made several changes to add more flavor: 3 Tbl sugar (white or brown). enough water or beef broth to submerge meat. 6 garlic cloves. 2 bay leaves. 3 Tbl butter. 12 whole Allspice. 1/2 tsp pepper. NO SALT!!!!! 5 red potatoes (instead of 10 - leaves more liquid in pot). 3 carrots (sliced instead of matchstick pieces). No cabbage (cooked seperately to prevent sogginess). 2 Onions (quartered). Hope this helps. Enjoy!","Excellent Recipe! We didn't use beer, but did use Low Sodium Beef Stock in place of water. Started the Corned Beef with Seasoning Packet on Low at 9:00 this morning, added the potatoes, carrots and onions at 2:00 and added cabbage at 4:00. Sat down to eat an absolute wonderful meal at 6:15. Meat was extremely tender and vegetables were perfect. This is the only way we will ever prepare this meal. Thanks for sharing!","All agreed this was probably the best corned beef and cabbage dinner I ever made. I actually surprised myself. I have to detail what I did in this review so that I don’t forget what I did and can duplicate it the next time I make it! I started the meat alone, with a bottle of Guinness and enough water to cover, on “high” for an hour and then turned it to “low.” Three hours after I started it I added the (peeled) potatoes and carrots (no onion). Late afternoon I gave it another hour on high, then turned it back down to low. I cooked the (savoy) cabbage separately on the stovetop in some of the strained cooking liquid from the slow cooker. The meat, sliced against the grain, was tender as can be and cut into perfect slices. The potatoes, also, were cooked to the ideal tenderness. “Creamy Horseradish and Garlic Spread,” recipe also from this site, was EXCELLENT with the meat and “Grandma Andrews’ Irish Soda Bread,” also excellent I might add, rounded out this memorable St.Patrick’s Day meal. I SO wish I would have taken a picture of this gorgeous dinner, but everyone was in a big hurry to eat!","Very good! I also added a little garlic powder, onion powder and fresh ground pepper. I used Guinness Draught for the beer. I will definitely be making this recipe again next St. Patrick's Day. It taste just like my mom's recipe, and she's Irish. :)","very, very tasty, but next time I will put the veggies in about 4 hrs. not at the beginning, and I will make it again soon.",I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect. I highly recommend it. It was so good and so simple to make!,"This came out perfect…the best corned beef dinner ever I think. Here is what I did exactly. I look over my brisket I am buying very carefully at the store. A thinner cut with not too much marbling throughout but a nice level of fat at the top. I bought a 3 ½ pound brisket. First, line the bottom of the crock pot with small red potatoes (whole with the skins), baby carrots and a white onion, cut in 8ths. Sprinkle the spice packet that came with the brisket (if you have one) on top of the vegetables. Trim off some of the fat from the brisket so the vegetables won’t get too oily but make sure to leave some so the meat will stay moist while cooking. Place the brisket on top of the vegetables, fat side UP. Pour in ½ can of Guinness and enough water to almost cover the brisket with just a little of the fat come through the surface. Add some pickling spice on top of the brisket; cover and cook for 8 hours on HIGH (yes high). When it was finished, I took the brisket out, covered it with aluminum foil and let it site while I added the wedges of cabbage to the crock pot with the other vegetables. I let that cook on high for 30 minutes. Everything was perfect and not mushy at all. No leftovers!","Amazing! I cooked this exactly as the recipe shows and it turned out fantastic. I don't even like corned beef that well, but I had two helpings!","I tried using this recipe and cooking corned beef for my first time yesterday. My boyfriend said he always used a pressure cooker for corned beef and that it had been good a few times and bad a few times so I was little apprehensive. However, this was a grand slam!!! I purchased a 3 lb corned beef roast from Sam's Club and we at all but about 1 dinner worth of left overs!!! Details: I did put my crockpot on high for the 9 hours despite reviews saying not too. The corned beef just fell apart perfectly. Next time I will not add potatoes or carrots until about 4 hours in and I will add cabbage about 1 1/2 hours before (probably because it barely fit in my crockpot it took a bit longer to cook)...I also took tips on adding a few beef bullion cubes and added more corrinder, mustard seed, peppercorns, and some garlic powder. I just had a 24 oz budweiser and used about half of that. I have a ton of leftover cabbage and will be using it with kielbasa tonight. Another great tip from a reviewer was to make the ""Creamy horseradish and garlic spread"" for the corned beef!! It is on this site and to die for!! For horseradish lovers add a little extra:)","Generally speaking, I think I still prefer my corned beef between a couple of pieces of rye with a little swiss cheese and some ground mustard. Can't really blame this recipe for that. There are no spices to be critical of. The meat takes care of that. Many thoughts on cooking this on high or low. I opted to go with the recipe, and the meat was perfect along with the carrots and potatoes (no mush). Since I like my cabbage a little firmer, I followed one suggestion to take the meat out to rest, and throw the cabbage in for about 20 minutes. Don't let all the reviews confuse you. Just follow the recipe. UPDATE: Decided to go at again this year. The only thing I changed was to add a little bit of beef base (best stuff ever) to the water. DELICIOUS! I don't know whether it was just better corned beef, or that little change, but loved it. When I was cleaning up, I was ready to drink the liquid at the bottom or the slow cooker. The wife who isn't a big meat eater (I think something's wrong with her), really enjoyed it too. She kept the remaining potatoes and liquid for leftovers. By the way, we like more potatoes than the recipe. Some Guinness Black Lager to drink, and Irish Soda Bread Cookies for dessert, and I have a serious case of happy belly.",Very Good! I made the recipe for St.Patrick's day. It was so nice to do the cooking in the morning and have it all ready to go that evening. My family really enjoyed it.,"The meat was ok, but DO NOT use Guinness Extra Stout as the beer. The carrots were absolutely horrible cooked in that.","Oh..... this is sooo good! I used beef broth instead of beer and added two small turnips. I cooked the corned beef by itself until the last forty five minutes then added all the vegetables. After the vegetables were cooked, I took everything out of the crock pot, and poured the broth into a stock pot and cooked the cabbage in the broth for about twenty minutes. If you cook the vegetables and cabbage for eight or nime hours, they will turn into mush. Believe me this is the best way to cook this meal.... It's fantastic and I got raving reviews!!!","I was so impressed with this recipe, and with how well it came out, I hardly changed the recipe: I added all the water and the whole bottle of beer- (I would never dump beer and since it was 6 am I didn't drink it either...well maybe if it was a saturday...) the brisket did not come with the spice packet so I added ground pepper, 2 garlic cloves and some allspice. It looked and tasted beautiful- awesome!!!! UPDATE: The leftover liquid works well as a ""beef broth,"" I froze it until I needed it and used it in a mushroom barley soup- delicious once watered down if too salty!! Just need to strain it a little!","Cooked on hi for 4 hrs. added carrots potatoes onions and cooked for 3 hrs. on low, then added cabbage and cooked for additional hr. Turned out the best ever.","I just made this tonight. Yes, you do need to cook it on high for 8 hours if you want the corned beef to be fall-apart tender and the fat to practically melt off the meat. If you want nice, neat slices, by all means, cook it on low. But it will not be as tender. I didn't quarter the potatoes, so that may be why they didn't fall apart. The carrots got a little too well done, but still edible and in one piece. You might want to put them in half way through. But everything was delicious!",I've used this recipe about 4 times now (without the beer) and it comes out great every time!,"This was the first time cooking corned beef and cabbage. This turned out so amazing. I will never use another recipe. I read all the reviews and decided to go with this: I put the brisket in and sprinkled the spice packet and three smashed garlic cloves, then used a bottle of gluten free beer and enough water to cover the meat and turned my crock pot on High. About 4 hours in I added 6 yukon golds cut in half lenghtwise, several sliced carrots, and 1 whole onion cut in 1/8th. 2 1/2 hours later I removed the vegetables and added 8 brussel sprouts cut in half, and a cabbage cut into 1/8ths. I left this all in for another 2 1/2 hours. Then I took out the meat and let sit, and returned the vegetables in with the cabbage to warm. PERFECTION!. the meat sliced like butter, and ALL the vegetables were perfectly soft without any mush.I kept the pot on High the whole time.","I have only one adjustment to this recipe, as it is pretty perfect just the way it is... There is just far too much liquid for a slow cooker recipe. The only liquid I add is (gasp!) a 12 oz. bottle of Corona Extra. The lighter beer adds just the right amount of flavor to the veggies without overwhelming them.","Clearly this recipe is VERY forgiving. When you read so many of the reviewers cooking it entirely differently you can assume that almost any version will turn out well. I have made it twice, both times it turned out the way I like it; shredded like carnitas. I added 4 3/4 cups total liquid, beer (used IPA) and water in any ratio you want. I also added baby whole potatoes, small bag from Trader Joes, four carrots sliced in thick rounds, and one whole onion sliced in rings. The potatoes and onions I put on the bottom of crock pot with the meat on top. Carrots went around the sides (I add cabbage cut in 1/8s two hours before you serve meat). I did use the spice packet enclosed with the meat and also added a few tablespoons of brown sugar, a couple of cloves of diced garlic, four or so bay leaves, and a couple of teaspoons of mustard seed. Don't add additional salt, corned beef is already salted so its not necessary. Again, there is so much variation in cooking temperatures and times from people that have cooked this, I am pretty sure anything suggested will work. I start my crock pot on high for two hours, turn it down to low for four to six, then back up to high when I put in cabbage for another hour or two. My total cooking time varies from 8 - 10 hours depending on when I want to serve and how long I have it on high. If you need more of a ""plan"" then that; go four hours high, four hours low and you will be pleased. Pretty stress free receptive and VERY flavorful.","This was amazing! The meat was tender and delicious and the vegetables a nice texture. I made a few changes to accommodate my pantry: At the recommendation of other reviewers, I used beef broth in place of water - I think about 2 cups which was what I had on hand. I didn't have baby red potatoes, so used full size red potatoes cut in eighths, and dumped in a bunch of baby carrots. Didn't have beer, so didn't use any. I actually cooked this in my slow-cooker on low for 10 hours. My family was thrilled with this meal. I will definitely make this again. Glad I tried it before St. Patty's Day so I can get more corned beef while it's still on sale. Thanks, Lusyrsgirl!",This was my first time making corned beef and cabbage. It was AWESOME. So easy a caveman could do it. I cooked it on low though.....,I make this recipe every year. The reason some of the comments complain about it being tough is because you need to choose the flat cut rather than brisket cut. Flat cut is leaner.,"I also cooked on low for 8 hrs, as a previous review... Corned beef Brisket just fell apart . I cooked recipe as written except for high crock pot setting. Was perfect flavor did not need to add extra seasoning. I added 12oz beer and 3 cups of water. I found my veg soft but not mushy which was perfect. This was my 2nd year making family loves it!","I like my potatoes and carrots a little firm (not mushy) so I placed them in the bottom of the pot then added a couple of smashed garlic cloves and the onions. I placed the meat on the top then covered. cooked for about 6 hours on high or until the potatoes and carrots had a bit of resistance when inserting a fork(they were cut fairly large). Removed the meat, scooped out the potatoes and carrots and replaced with the cabbage put the meat back in to cook for 3 more hours. I took out alot of the water and heated the potatoes and carrots back up in it. Voila. I had my meat done perfectly and my potatoes and carrots still had the flavor I wnated but were not mushy. Purfection.","Turned out great! I have made corned beef and cabbage twice before and my husband complained about the cabbage being mushy, but not with this recipe. I substituted some of the water for a beer, added garlic, 2 Tb sugar and 2 Tb apple cider vinegar and the recipe was perfect.","8-10 hours on LOW! High at 8 hours is too long and unnecessary. I've always cooked mine on LOW for 8-10 hours and it turns out perfect. And, whole peeled red potatoes cooked for that long also turn out soft and wonderful!",I tried this on my busiest night and ended up eating 3 hours later than usual which put my kids going to bed at 10 instead of 8 :( I cooked it on low and put cabbage in an hour before it was done and it took an extra 3 hours to finish cooking next time Ill cook on high and put cabbage in 2 hours before its done.,,,,
164,"This is so good! I tried the recipe as written the first time and agree that a bit more sauce is needed. So the second time I made it I increased the sauce ingredients by 1/2 and it was plenty. I used a prepackaged frozen seafood medley in place of all shrimp and it was wonderful. I also think the pepper amount was fine. It is peppery but after all, the recipe is for ""Shrimp Lemon PEPPER Linguini"". I can see though how some taste buds might think it is too much pepper. Overall, this recipe is a winner. It is definately restaurant quality and definately good enough to serve to company.","Unfortunately, I did not have any linguini on hand and had to use spaghettini. I strongly do not suggest changing the pasta. This is truly a recipe best reserved for linguini or any other wide pasta and nothing else. I will try and use less lemon zest next time since I prefer a more 'shrimpy' taste than a 'lemony' one. This, of course, is just a personal taste though. This was an especially tasty recipe and one everyone should try!","EEEEE-YUM!! I didn't put in the full amount of pepper and I DID double the sauce. Such a wonderful, yummy recipe! This goes into my ""favorites"" book! Thanks skini.","Delicious, and EASY. I followed other reviewers suggestions and increased the amount of sauce ingredients and it was perfect. I've made this three times now. The second time I grilled the shrimp on skewers and the third time we used grilled chicken breast in place of the shrimp and it was fabulous.It's very light and perfect for summer. Top it with some fresh grated parmesan cheese and some fresh tomatoes on the side and you have the perfect meal. Thanks for a wonderful recipe skini!","Short and sweet...this was excellent. Enjoyed preparing this nearly as much as I enjoyed eating it. Didn't measure anything (takes the fun out of cooking!), just cooked to my heart's content. Fresh, basic and exquisite ingredients. Beautiful dish. Simply perfect. My tummy is a happy camper tonight.","Really good and really quick! This was my first time cooking w/ shrimp- and I even cheated! I bought a big bag of precooked shrimp. I thawed them in water, them warmed them through in the oil/garlic sauce. I did not have any wine, just did w/o. We didn't even miss it!","Very good, very easy...we really enjoyed this one. The only change I made was to add some capers along with the lemon...so yummy.","I thought the amount of sauce was perfect. It tasted great, but I have to admit we were sweating pretty soon after we started eating. I'll definitely make it again, but I'm going to use less pepper next time.",The overall taste of this dish was good. There was way too much pepper for my husband & me --we had to rinse the food off and start over. I would recommend adding the salt and pepper to taste and not following the 2tsp given in the recipe.,"Honestly, I found the proportions in this recipe inexplicable. First, the ratio of broth to wine and lemon juice seems so off. It tasted awful when I followed those directions: way too much wine and juice, so it tasted very sharp and acidic. I ended up having to add a tbsp of sugar to counteract the acidity. The perfect ratio is 2 cups broth to 1/2 cup wine to 2 tbsps lemon juice. That is more classic and turns out far better. Let that boil down until only half remains. Second, the pepper is great, but the amount is absurd. It is supposed to taste peppery, not set your mouth on fire. I found 1/2 tsp pepper enough to provide a great bite and rich flavor. You can stir in a little cream at the end to make the sauce 'saucier'; it is very runny as written. With the changes, it's good, and it's easy to make.","This recipe is easy to make and it's sure to be a family favorite! There is no need to add or modify anything. If you close your eyes when you take a bite, you will think you are in an italian restaurant. Easily a five star main dish. I get requests to make this regularly!","Very good. Just tweeked it to our liking, and doubled sauce mixture so there would be plenty of juice for dipping some good crusty Italian bread. Your linguini will suck up a lot of juice so you really do need to double the amount. I peeled the shrimp earlier in day and cooked the shells with 1 1/2 cups of water and boiled for 5 minutes with a few twists of cracked pepper. I used 1/2 cup of shrimp stock and 1/2 cup of pasta water along with the chicken broth and wine. Very similar to what I've had in good Italian restaurants. I did not use basil instead I used 1 tsp dried oregano. Also used 2 pinches crushed red pepper flakes, and fresh cracked black pepper only for taste 2 tsp is really overkill. The butter really helps smooth out the taste, and we love the fresh lemony taste you come across every now and then. The shrimp pick up every flavor. My husband enjoyed it so much he wants me to use it as a base for mussels the next time. Lump crabmeat along with the shrimp would be great too. Thanks.",We simply did not care for this dish. There was very little flavor even with additional garlic. I won't be making this again,"add capers, asparagus, dbl sauce & change pepper to 1/2 teas. 2 cups broth to 1/2 wine to 2 Tbl. lemon juice","This sauce blew us away. You could actually skip the shrimp and just do veggies or chicken or whatever you want. I added asparagus (just cut up and add to the pasta water 3 to 4 minutes before pasta is done cooking) and I added candy cherry tomatoes from Whole Foods at the end and that really put it over the top. I also added just a couple of spoons of light sour cream as other reviewers suggested just to thicken it up a bit, although it does thicken nicely after sitting a few minutes. Oh and definitely double the sauce recipe. This makes 4 very large servings and is definitely restaurant quality! Super easy to make but I definitely suggest preparing as much as you can beforehand, because once you get going, it goes very fast!","This was wonderful and so easy! I, too, used frozen shrimp. This dish is a great,light tasting meal. We really enjoyed it. Thank you!!","Two syllables: YUM-MY!. I didn't use the exact measurements of the lemon, white wine and pepper, instead I just went according to taste and doubled the amount of chicken broth. I added 2 Tbsp of Italian bread crumbs to thicken the sauce up a bit. And I added some grated Parmesan as suggested by other reviewers. This is a keeper in my book.","5* very good. i doubled the sauce, except for the pepper and I didn't have fresh parsley so i used 3 tblsp. dried parsley. Also, i didn't have linguini and used angel hair and it was perfect, i think linguini would have been too big for this sauce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

167,"Just a quick tip on how to brine a turkey, especially when your fridge is full of other holiday goodies! Ive done it this way for a few years now, and it works great. Instead of soaking in the stock pot overnight, I put the turkey & brine mixture in a oven bag, squeeze out the air, and tie it shut. Put the bagged turkey in a cooler with ice overnight.","This really does make the juiciest turkey. Cooks Illustrated magazine recommends letting the turkey sit in the refrigerator for several hours uncovered after rinsing off the brine, so that the skin will brown and crisp up.","I loved this recipe when I made it last year for Christmas, but I have a question...when I turned the bird 2/3 through cooking it fell apart. Does anyone know why? Did I cook it too long?","fantastic!!! i will never make a turkey another way again!!! The veggies were awesome! I was so nervous to flip the turkey cause I was by myself!!, but I have a tip...take 2 pot holders and put them in freezer ziplock bags. put your hands in the bags, grab the bird and flip!!! it was sooooooo easy...i didn't even burn myself...lol!!!","This is outrageous. My husband was a serious skeptic of the brining process... until carving time came. I'm amazed the bird made it to the table! Absolutely amazing. *Definitely* use more vegetables. Especially carrots. I added a smidge of wine to the gravy I made from the drippings and it set it off perfectly. Definitely the best gravy we've ever had -- which we didn't even need with such a moist, delicious turkey! Thank you!","I have used this recipe for 3 years...it always comes out succulent. Even the leftovers are moist days later. I double up oven baking bags to brine overnight in the fridge. (I don't use the oven bags to cook in though.) The meat isn't salty, so don't be afraid to use the full amount of kosher salt. I do flip the bird breast up at the end like the recipe calls for. I follow the recipe with a few tweaks...I add lots of fresh sage inside the cavity (thyme is good but sage smells and tastes like Thanksgiving to me) & sprinkle a little no-salt poultry seasoning on the outside. If I have some fresh yams & apples, I'll chunk up a couple inside the bird too with the other veggies. Be sure to use a good wine that you'd drink. The gravy is to die for. I pureed some of the carrots, onions & celery separately (use a hand blender if you have one or make sure the veggies aren't hot if you use the blender....no apple or yams in the gravy puree) to add to the gravy drippings to taste. I use a grease separator for the drippings and make a roux out of a little of the fat from the top off the drippings to start of the gravy. Resting before you carve is really, really important. The juices go back into the meat. Make your gravy and bake your rolls while it's resting. That way you aren't tempted to carve too soon. The carcass, leftover veggies & drippings go straight into the pot for day-after Turkey Barley soup that my has become as much of a family tradition as the turkey dinner.",Had to downsize recipe since I only had a 12lb turkey. This is the only way I will do turkey from now on. I changed it slightly by stuffing the turky with chopped apples instead of the veggies and put all the veggies in the pan. Also added double the amount of white wine.,"I highly recommend this turkey recipe! Made it for Thanksgiving and it's the best one and the easiest that I've used. The brining makes the turkey superbly moist and flavourful. I used aluminium foil to cover it for 2/3 of the cooking time. The vegetables outside the turkey were too oily for my family's taste, and the stuffed vegetables were still very crunchy. I will boil the stuffed vegetables first next time.","This was the moistest turkey I have ever had in my entire life. It was gone as fast as lighting. I did not have the wine on hand so I substituted it out with chicken broth. It was great, so favorful and juicy. Great recipe!!! Kim",I was so excited to try this recipe but unfortunately I had already bought a Butterball turkey. Butterball turkeys are already brined which I never realized before. I saw on the label that it is infused with a 7% salt solution so I googled it and found out you should never brine a Butterball because it will come out too salty (which I'm guessing is the reason a few users said this recipe was too salty). So when buying a turkey for this recipe make sure it is not already brined. I will try this recipe with a different brand another time:),"I was pretty brave this year! After reading the reviews for the turkey, I decieded to make the turkey. Thanksgiving was at my sister in law's house, which created a problem. Without my wifes permission I asked my sister in law if I could make the turkey. So as I'm preparing the turkey and bring it over to her house I decieded to tell her, ""I've never made a turkey before"". She was really supportive and when the turkey was on its breast that through them for a loop. Ofcourse the whole party was focused on this turkey. It better not be dry was the overall response. I'm not going to lie, I was so nervous. Flipping over the turkey was pretty tough since it was 24lbs, next time I'll use a lower roasting pan to help with the flipping. After 5hrs 15mins the turkey was finished. Let's just say by the end of the night my new nickname was ""TURKEY BOY"" I've never tasted turkey so moist, even the white meat dripped of juices!! I soaked it in Celtic Sea Salt for about 16hrs and followed the veggies & added about 2 1/2 cups of white wine! Thanks for this outstanding recipe. This was my first turkey and I'll stay with this recipe for life. Thanks for making me a hero!!!",All I can say is OMG!! What a GREAT turkey!!! We enjoyed it for Chirstmas dinner and couldn't keep our guests from havinf seconds and thirds! Thank you so much!,I will never cook a turkey any other way. Tres Bien!,"Excellent recipe the first time I made it and here's what I did to change it up for Christmas. I brined it overnight in a cooler in 8 gallons of ice cold water to 8 cups of kosher salt and 6 cups of loosely packed dark brown sugar. After taking it out of the brine mix I thoroughly rinsed it. I then put the turkey in a bowl in the fridge to rest for 3 hours then discarded more of the brine. Set oven at 400 degrees. Paper towelled the brined turkey dry, put unsalted butter under the skin of the breast with 1 large bay leaf under skin of each breast. I then rubbed a mixture of roasted garlic, unsalted butter, and sage all over the turkey. I put the turkey on a bed of carrots, celery, and onion, breast side down, then added 1/4 cup water. Turkey roasted uncovered for 1 hour at 400 degrees fahrenheit, without opening oven door turned it down to 300 degrees fahrenheit. Roasted at 300 degrees fahrenheit for an hour. Opened the door to baste the turkey. Roasted another hour at 300 and basted again. Covered turkey with foil. Roasted another 15 - 30 minutes. Uncovered turkey, basted it and probed with thermometer, removed when it reached 180 degrees fahrenheit. Discarded the veggies! Let the turkey rest for 20 minutes covered with foil. All in all roasted 3 1/2 hours. Best turkey I have ever had! Moist, flavourful and delicious yes even the breast. NOTES: don't use chicken broth or salted butter on a brined turkey or your gravy/turkey will be salty.",Hands down the best turkey ever.,"The Thanksgiving meal this year promised to be difficult due to my diagnosis of fibromyalgia. I had to plan a meal that I could starting preparing several days ahead and only work on it a short time each day. This turkey recipe allowed me to do that, and was totally delicious and juicy, even though cooked and sliced the day before Thanksgiving and reheated. I also found these other recipes that I prepared and then refrigerated to await Tday baking: Day Before Mashed Potatoes, Sweet Potato Casserole II, Thanksgiving Cheese Ball, Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake. In using the Shopping List feature, it allowed my sometimes foggy brain to be very organized. Thank you, AllRecipes, for all the help in overcoming my disability to continue a meaningful family tradition!","I've brined my turkey for more than 10 years now. There a guaranty that your turkey will be moist & juicy when brining. I add much more flavor to my brine however and it makes a huge difference. I also add some unsalted butter (you should ALWAYS use unsalted butter with any meat you have brined!!) into the cavity along with the veggies. Also fill the neck cavity with same. I've never started out the bird breast side down, either. Really no need with a brined bird. Plus, you risk having it fall apart like a reviewer said, when turning it over and it certainly will not look as picture perfect as when roasted breast side up the whole time. Trust me, a brined turkey will be wonderfully moist. If you use any sugar in your brine or apple juice (as I do) keep the turkey covered the entire roasting time so that the skin does not brown too quickly! I also have several comments in the Brining Article that offer some great tips & suggestions. Happy Turkey!! Aunt Tilly","I bought a small turkey to try this recipe because I didn't want to serve something that wasn't perfect on Thanksgiving day and boy am I glad I did!! Yes this turkey was moist, but the flavor and moistness was exactly the same as when you use a turkey oven bag. And I COULDN'T stuff it with this recipe. I'm sticking with what works.","I will never cook another turkey without the brine first! This is the first time I have used the brining method and it was delicious. Every part was tender and juicy. The turkey was for my husband's military function and it was the first thing to go. The other turkey there was hardly touched. I didn't have thyme however I got a tip from Alton Brown about the veggies you cook in the bird. Chop the onion, celery and carrots, then microwave them in a dish with shallow water for 3-4 min. This gets the cooking started for the veggies and helps to infuse the flavors faster. I also sprinkled garlic powder and pepper on the outside before cooking.","Oh My Goodness!! I made this at Thanksgiving - TO DIE FOR!!! My family raved about it! I took pictures - which looks like something off of a Butterball commercial or something!!! I will post them at a later date!!! Definitely Brine the bird overnight - since I didn't have the fridge space I placed the bird in a large cooler, topped with water and added lots of ice to keep it cold. Use a plate to weigh the bird down under the water. I used cooking wine instead of regular table wine. Definitely use more veggies. Whatever you do, don't put stuffing in the bird - gets VERY soggy!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe with the world!!! ;))","I also scattered all the veggies around the turkey in the pan, stuffed it and stuck an apple in at the neck. My method is, when the apple is done, so is the turkey. (It works). This is the only recipe I will use from now on. We were in heaven last year, and plan to be there again this year! The turkey was incredibly moist from the brining, and the gravy was to die for. My husband ate all the carrots, but I did puree some of the onion into it. Thank you so much for this recipe, Shelly!","The reviews dont lie! This is the BEST turkey! This was our first turkey and I wont lie, we were a little nervous. My husband was unsure about turning it half way through and we were worried about the saltiness. No need to worry! Just follow the instructions! For those who said it was too salty, we did end up using only about half the kosher salt for an 18lb turkey. But you HAVE to rinse the turkey REALLY well before cooking. We stuffed it with stuffing instead of the veggies and just used all the veggies in the pan. The stuffing turned out amazing! Other then those few changes, we followed the instructions to a T and it was wonderful! There was Lots of juices at the bottom for gravy, the veggies were delicious and the turkey was out of this world! Just like other reviewers said, I had people who dont even usually like turkey who absolutely loved it. My Nana even went as far to say it was the best meal she ever had. For flipping it over, we had the legs held under the skin to prevent it for all falling apart. Then my husband used oven mits covered in plastic bags to flip it. Sounds silly, but it worked perfectly. Perfectly browned skin all the way around. This is our turkey recipe for life! And I think we'll be making lots of it since, as of last night, we have been named the official turkey cookers from now on!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
168,"The recipe's fine as is. I don't understand the need on the part of some to completely re-write the recipe. If you do that, you've created a NEW recipe, so why bother rating this one, as is? (Am I gonna be banned/kicked off the recipe.com site now for pointing out rudeness?) Just curious. :) This is a new take on the tuna casserole recipe. You either like it or you don't. I think it's fine, as written. Thank you to the creator for posting their creation.","This recipe was excellent as it was written. I 100% agree with ChgoFoodieGal when she said it's ridiculous to thoroughly CHANGE the recipe and then rate it. We are rating THIS recipe. I can maybe see adding more spice or possibly one item, but some raters change almost all the ingredients except the main one, losing the entire concept of the rating system. Good grief.","This is a simple recipe! It easily adapts. I didn't have FF Onion, and was out of cheddar. Instead, I used 2 slices provolone & 2 slices of american cheese on top. At the end of baking, I added pan toasted/buttered homemade crouton & pan toasted sliced almonds. I very much agree w/ the suggested extra can of tuna & more moisture (1/2-3/4 C. Milk or water). I prefer Cream of Mushroom. I add a dash of this and that of my favorite spices. It wasn't too creamy or too rich. My husband had cringed at the notion of Tuna Casserole at dinner. Once he tried it, he asked for seconds and THIRDS -- plus he's even requested it a few weeks later...Now, thats what I like-- a simple, basic recipe that is a family favorite! My toddler also loved it. Next time, I'll add some peas to complete this one dish meal.","My husband and I agree that this is the best tuna casserole we've ever had! Thanks, Lindsay's roommate! However, other reviewers were right on when they suggested a few additions - like 1/2 to 3/4 cup milk, another can of tuna, and Velveeta cheese. Also, if you are like me and are unsure how much macaroni to cook to get 3 cups cooked, I finally found a conversion for pasta on a cook's chart. According to that chart, 1 cup uncooked pasta will yield 2+ cups cooked. So, I am going to try 1 1/2 cups uncooked next time instead of just eyeballing it...despite the great fun that can be!","SOOO GOOD! I used 4 C of cooked macaroni, 2 cans of tuna, one can cream of chicken soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/4 C of milk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, blackpepper powder, 2 TBSP mayonnaise, and 1 tsp of dijon mustard. I put some cheddar cheese with the pasta mixture and put on top a combination of cheddar cheese and Italian mix cheese. On top of that, I melted 4 TBSP of butter, combined with 8 TBSP of seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled on top of the cheese. This is totally Da Bomb!","From the start, I heeded the advice of other reviewers: added one can of mushroom soup, an extra can of tuna, half a can of milk, and a can of peas. I tasted the mixture at that point, and it was pretty good. For extra flavor, I added lemon pepper, garlic powder, dry mustard, and basil. I was generous with everything but the mustard. I used lowfat soups and omitted the cheese to save a few fatgrams, and it was still delicious, and easy, too!","Very good base recipe. I summarized others' advice for my liking so the renovated ingredients were: 2 cans of tuna, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom, garlic salt, frozen peas, about 1/2c mayo, black pepper, diced onions, a touch of whole milk, about 4 cups cooked macaroni, 1 c shredded cheese, and 1 c french friend onions. It was very good and i couldn't stop eating it for days (tasted good the next day too). Even though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I couldn't stop thinking it needed something else. The diced onions and french friend onions added a little crunch, but more was needed. My mom used to make a tuna casserole using leftover potato chips. I think that would be perfect to try in this next time - crush up the potato chips and mix in with the casserole. It adds a lightly crunchy potato. I'll also add a dash of tabasco sauce next time for a kick as was also suggested. I'm keeping this recipe - in the form I changed it to. :-) 3 stars because it's a base recipe but definitely needs kicks to it. Thanks, Andrea, for the start to many interesting creations from this!","This was extremely wonderful - my new comfort food! I made a few of the alterations other people suggested: 2 cans of tuna, frozen peas, one can cr. of chicken, one can cr. of mushroom, plus some garlic salt. I tasted it at that point, and found I was wanting a little bit of zing in it. So I added about 2/3 cup of mayo, and it turned out marvelous. I would recommend trying that for a bit of zip. I also omitted the onions since I didn't have any. But all said, this recipe is a great starting point, and probably would have been awesome if left alone too. I am pregnant, and think it's become one of my new cravings... (new addition: I love pickles with my tuna sandwiches, so I thought, why not? I threw in some dried dill weed, and it tastes marvelous!)","I so agree with CHGOFOODIEGAL, don't show a review with totallly changing the recipe. ALL recipes, and I mean ALL recipes are individual creations. whenever you adapt/change/alter, which is what ALL good cooks do for personal preferences, you have then made a unique/personal recipe, which you should take the time to adapt, measure, and do all the things necessary to make it your own version, and publish it. Not totally embelish and change someones creation or adaptation of a recipe THEY made for personal taste. TRY the recipe as printed, rate it, then make your own adjustments for taste later, and create your own recipe.. Nick Stellino, a personal mentor, and expert southern mediterranean chef, in his book, ""CUCINA AMORE"", that taught me the basics of cooking and adapting, says the same thing. Try it the way it is written, then, as all recipes are, adapt to make it your own, through experiment and creativeness, and personal taste.. Kimberly, this was an excellent version of an old family standby in comfort foods. Thank you....And I am sure I will adjust it somewhat for personal preference, AFTER, I try it your way...hehe. Thanks girl. very good as is. 5 stars for your creative juices. keep'em coming..","like everyone else, i added to this recipe, but found it to be an excellent one. i doubled it to feed 5 adults and added 2 cups frozen peas and used 3 cans total of albacore tuna. also added some black pepper and tabasco sauce for some kick and there were no left overs!! darn it! can't believe how easy it was to make too, definately will make again!",I agree with previous reviewers. This recipe is good in its original form and the addition of the fried onion rings is very good. You other reviewers have created entirely new recipes when you make as many changes as some of you have made. Why not submit your version as a new recipe? Sorry to be critical but people are looking for a review of THIS recipe and not one that you have created from this one. PLEASE!!!,"I love tuna, in any way, shape or form. I liked the fried onion addition and so did my kids. I did add fresh minced onion, green pepper and some seasonings to the mixture, including cayenne, being that my girls were born with asbestos mouths. With my older daughter taking three dance classes and the youngest ten classes, an easy and quick recipe is something I'm always looking for. Loved it Lindsay and thanks!","This recipe is delicious. I wholeheartedly Disagree with ChgoFoodieGal and Hobbesmom's comments. I love to read modifications to recipes as I am a beginning cook and like to get creative and interesting ideas on how I can change recipes and make them even better. Thats what this website is about .....right? My substitutes were I used 1 cup of milk, 2 cans of tuna , a can of cream of chicken soup, a pinch of onion and garlic powder, a pinch of pepper, and after it was all stirred together I put about two cups of cheddar cheese on top I sprinkled some Italian breadcrumbs over it. I also used a smaller pyrex dish not a 9x13 one as the noodles seem to spread to thin over the glass and did not cover the bottom completly. It came out a 10 !! Wonderful recipe. My husband and I ate the whole thing ....no leftovers!! Next time I may add a little more cheddar cheese and forget the italian breadcrumbs. Dont get too carried away with seasoning, mine turned out perfect but it could have been easy to go overboard with the garlic and onion powders.","This was really good. I added a bit of salt. I was reading the reviews, and it seems some people didn't cook the macaroni beforehand, or measured out dry pasta, then cooked and added it. The recipe specifically says ""3 cups cooked macaroni"". It's kind of hard to rate and comment on something if you didn't follow the recipe correctly. ;)",I hate tuna and I like it.,"The handiest tips I gathered from pouring through the reviews -- 2 cups uncooked macaroni = 3 cups cooked as called for; and, 1/2 soup can of milk made a great consistency. Excellent -- comfort dining at its finest!","Had a full day of yard work planned yesterday, so I wanted something easy for dinner. I know this recipe has had great reviews, but it was just a disappointment. I made this dish exactly as written, and there's not enough filling for a 9x13 dish; I used an 8x8 and it wasn't spilling over the top of the dish. It must just be a taste preference, but we didn't care for it. My apologies to the recipe writer for the bad review (I rarely give one), but this just didn't work for us.",This couldn't be any easier. I used 2 cans of tuna. I don't even know what french fried onions are? I used fried onions tasted great. Thanks Lindsay.,"So, I did change the recipe, but I think this would be great even without the changes. I added an extra can of tuna, a can of cream of mushroom soup because my husband likes mushrooms, a sprinkling of lemon pepper, salt, pepper and onion powder and lastly- 1/4 C of sour cream. Basically, I added the tuna/cream of mushroom for taste/creaminess, the spices to balance out the extra tuna and the sour cream because it was in my fridge and would have gone bad otherwise. This is a great base recipe that I bet tastes good on its own, but tastes absolutely awesome with my additions. Creamy, but not overwhelmingly fishy. Reminds me a little of Tuna Helper, but is not nearly as salty and a heck of a lot creamier/sturdier. Feel free to mess around with this recipe, I don't think you can mess it up.",yum - plus its a sinch! my family likes tuna - and i imagine you could make this taste great with canned salmon too.,My Grandma has been making a similar version of this recipie for years. She always makes it with egg noodles instead of macaroni. It's one of my favorites. You can also try adding peas mushrooms or celery. I love cheese so I always add a little to the soup/tuna mixture before I add the noodles. Also great with a little parmesan on the top.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

170,"I have to admit, I was skeptical with the flavor of the three dry mixes called for, but this was the best tasting roast I've ever had! Used ""herb gravy mix for beef"" which was the only one I could find and it was delicious. Had a lot leftover so I made wide noodles the next day and we had a yummy version of beef stroganoff. Definitely a keeper!","I've always thought that slower cooker dishes lack flavor. I put in flavorful ingredients, but the slow cooking process seems to homongenize everything and the liquid thins out the flavor. That did not happen with this recipe. The gravy was thick and rich and highly seasoned. I was very hesitant to use all those mixes, but I had them in the pantry (some for quite awhile) and I needed to use them up or throw them away. My husband had two helpings and proclaimed it ""Good stuff!"" Thank you so much for the post, keylimeone, this was great!","Loved this recipe! I went exactly by the recipe and this is the best pot roast ever. Very flavorful, just the right amount of seasoning. The gravy is rich and brown. The only change I would make next time is to add 3/4 cup of water instead. I like my gravy a tad thinner. I also added cubed potatoes.",I wish I could give this more stars. Made this tonight and it was absolutely amazing. My wife actually licked her plate. I was skeptical as others about the seasoning combinations but it was without a doubt top notch. The only addition I made was a little red cooking wine over the onions in the bottom and I sprinkled the roast with worcestershire sauce before putting the carrots and potatoes on top of the roast. I also used a much bigger roast. The roast I used was around 5 lbs. This recipe is on top of my list. Wife is still ranting about the roast and is upset it's better and easier then hers. Thanks for the recipe.,"I have been making this for years, but I do not use the flour or the water. Put the roast in the crock, add your potatoes or carrots (small red potatoes cut in half absorb the juices and are oh so yummy), sprinkle and in 10-12 hours a roast that tastes like it has been in the oven.","I decided to make this pot roast recipe based on the rave reviews. I have tried a couple others from the site in my crock pot, but none were as easy and delicious as this one! The ingredients were incredibly simple and inexpensive, and it took only about 10 minutes total to prepare. I was leary about the lack of liquid in with the roast, but the water from the carrots and onions mixed with the beef and seasoning to make a delicious broth! Tonight my boyfriend and I are making roast beef sandwiches from the left overs, and I couldn't be more excited! I found my new pot roast recipe and would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap, easy and delicious dinner!","Great recipe and the meat was so tender that it practically melts in your mouth! The first time I cooked it according to directions, the meat was too salty. So I made it again and made the following changes and it was a hit (and better too): 1. I only marinated the meat with black pepper. The dry seasonings have enough sodium already. 2. I couldn't find ranch dressing mix, so I used ranch dip mix instead. 3. I mixed the dry ingredients with hot water so that they'll melt faster and added some minced garlic too. Then let it sit for about 10 minutes before putting it into the slow cooker. Next time I'm going to put some jalapenos in there to make it spicy. ***Follow-up on my original review: I made couple of other changes and the dish turned out even better - 1. Mixed the dried ingredients with 1 cup of water. 2. Added crushed red peppers onto the dry ingredients according to how spicy I want it to be. 3. Marinated the meat with crushed peppercorns. 4. I scooped some of the sauce from the side with a ladle and poured it all over the top of the meat 2 & 1/2 hours before it was done, so that the top of the meat would not get too dry. 5. I served it with rice the first couple of times, but served it with spaghetti because this time (I only cooked them according to the package's directions, no salt added into the pasta water), poured some sauce over the noodles and then the meat on top. The sauce complemented the noodles really well.","My go to pot roast for the rest of my life. It's honestly THAT good! I've shared this recipe with a lot of people and they all agree it's insanely good (and easy to prepare!). Having made this over a dozen times, I have my own little ""enhancements"" but you don't need them as it is great as is, but these things just elevate this to a whole 'nother level. 1) I brown the WELL floured roast for a few minutes on all sides to get a nice caramelization going on before putting into the cooker. I am fortunate in that my slow cooker insert is non-stick metal and I can use it on the cooktop directly. 2) I use 1/2 cup red wine and 1/4 cup water for the dry mixes. 3) I add 4 or 5 stalks celery chopped up (in add'n to the carrots). Sometimes I add quartered red potatoes, but lately I just serve over mashed potatoes. If you find this is too salty for your liking (I love it as is) the potatoes will help cut that down - potatoes always help make food taste less salty FYI... 4) A few dashes of some Worcestershire sauce does wonders in the liquid mix. Let this baby go low and slow and you will be happy you found this recipe. If you want to get super creative try caramelizing the onions a little first. Thanks keylimeone! :)","Am I the only person who thought this was unbearably salty? I wanted to love this, it was so simple and seemed like a great idea. The meat was great, but the veggies and especially the gravy were so salty I could barely eat it. It made so much gravy, normally I'd be dancing with joy but I had to throw it out. I felt my blood pressure rising with every bite.",Best and easiest slow cooker pot roast I ever made!!! Very tender and tasty.Next time I'll try onion soup mix instead of onions. I used a bit more water( about 2 cups) and I added potatoes. It was delicious!!,"***** We LOVED this recipe! I thought that my mother's recipe was the best I'd ever had until I tried this one. I will always make this one from now on. It's fabulously flavorful and delicious. I added cut potatoes and more liquid for making the gravy because the 1/2 cup liquid seemed way too little. All in all, this recipe was an easy and delightful surprise for my husband and me.","This was the best pot roast I have ever had! The gravy made from the juices was the most amazing I have ever had! I didn't have a packet of Italian dressing seasoning mix, so I made it using the Italian dressing seasoning mix recipe from this site (I omitted the 2 tablespoons salt that recipe called for ....too salty) I used 2 cups beef broth instead of the water ....1/2 cup seemed too little! So glad I did cause the gravy was to die for! Will definitely be making this again!!","I tried this for the first time on some family. My cousin's husband begged me to pass the recipe on to his wife. Here are my additions/recommendations: i always use pearl onions in my pot roast because people love to get their own flavorful little onions, add sliced mushrooms to the crock pot about 2-3hrs before your done-they turn out wonderful, and lately i make garlic mashed potatoes on the side and serve all together in a bowl. This is a hit!","So this is the first time I've cooked a pot roast in the slow cooker. I usually do it in the oven. But this will be the only way I do it from now on!! Amazing. I read a lot of the reviews and took suggestions and added a few of my own. Here they are: 1- do not season the meat with salt. The seasonings have enough salt 2- instead of only 1/2 cup of water I used 3/4 of water and 1/4 of red wine. 3- I added baby carrots and small white potatoes cut in half 4- crushed up one clove of garlic and added it as well 5- 2 hours before it was done I added a handful of in chopped mushrooms 6- I took the roast out if the fridge and let it sit out at room temperature for at least a half hour, no more than an hour. Allows the meat to cook more evenly 7- finally I cooked the meat for 9 1/2 hours and the ends came out well done and the middle was a perfect medium rare 8- once done remove some jus, put in a pan and begin to warm. Meanwhile take 2 teaspoons of flour and about 4 teaspoons of water in a cup and whisk until you get a pancake like texture. Slowly add to the boiling jus constantly whisking. Creates a thick heavenly sauce Will do this every time as it was soooo good seems like a lot if extra steps but seriously made it incredible!!!","This is the best pot roast recipe! I am not a really big fan of roast, but every now & then I get a craving for comfort food like mom used to make. I rarely ever would make a roast because I just couldn't seem to find a recipe that really impressed me until I tried this one. This is now my go to recipe & my husband and I love it! I've made it quite a few times, playing around with it a bit. It's good as is, but I've also browned the meat it in oil & added 1/2 c. red wine along with the 1/2 c. water to the 3 mixes and this is by far my favorite way to make it. Even though it's just two of us, I usually get a 2-3 pound roast. I shred any leftovers and use it for sandwiches later in the week. Yummy!","Made this for Christmas dinner today. The house smelled wonderful and it was a very easy meal. The beef was very flavorful...so much so that I still have a bite of tang in my throat one hour later. I will reduce the dressing packets to 1/2 packet next time. I would imagine the sodium content in this recipe is through the roof and since I never really salt anything, it's particularly noticable to me. My family ate it but there were no raves. Just keep this in mind if you're sensative to sodium content.",This was absolutely the BEST meat i've ever had!,"Amazingly GOOD ! I did everything in the recipe, EXCEPT I covered the pot roast with chopped up carrots, potatoes and celery. A dome of veggies under the lid of the slow cooker. The veggies give up their water, cook down and there's plenty of JUS. A tender savory meal. LOVE this recipe ! Thanks !!!!","Ok, this is the best and easiest recipe you will ever try - I just threw away my previous recipes for pot roast after making this. My husband's exact words were ""This is the best roast beef I have ever had"" and says that when I have made it before the gravy was ""tasteless"". Thanks sweetie for telling me that. Anyway, I was skeptical about using 3 packets of mix but that is what did the trick - gravy was so flavorful. I used a 5 pound roast and this recipe still worked fine but increased water to 1 cup.","DH's question: ""Was someone drinking when they came up with this?"" Don't care - it is amazing! I cringed when I read about all the ""Packages"" of pantry treasures that were going into this.....but....this morning, while trying to throw dinner into the Crock Pot before work, it was a ""What the heck!"" 8 hours in the Crock Pot on Low. Added (Tweaker Alert) 1/4 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes and 3/4 cup of water & Celery & Granulated Garlic. (Not too tweaked - I hope)! This was delicious and I will suffer my rings not fitting tomorrow. Really good! Teenager's attacked it when they showed up after 9pm. Gone. 5 lbs. of chuck roast, whole bag of baby carrots, gone. They got hamburger buns out of the cabinet & were dipping the buns into the left over gravy. It is that good. Next time, will probably stick to the 1/2 cup of water instead of bumping it up to 3/4 cup water. Totally will add this to the Recipe Box! More than 5 stars!","When I came home after work my hubby declared this roast was ""da bomb!"" I made this on a day when I didn't have time to cook or plan. So I needed something super simple to quickly throw in the crockpot. Like others, I was skeptical about all the packaged seasonings. Usually I try to make my own instead of using the prepackaged stuff but I simply did not have time nor motivation to do so on this day. I did not add salt since the packaged seasoning would have plenty. Also, I used a reduced sodium gravy mix and added probably 3/4th cup water but next time will probably stick to 1/2 cup because it made way more gravy than we needed. However, this was delicious and I am so glad I found this recipe.","I have used this same recipe for a few years with beef as well as pork loins. I know it sounds strange, but it really adds some nice favors to the meat and makes a great gravy for rice, potato or pasta. The only problem is that your gravy can be rather salty to taste if made exactly as written. The problem is all those mixes contain a lot of salt which works well if used separately, but combined makes the dish way too salty. My solution has been to prepare larger batches of my own ranch and Italian seasoning mixes (from this site) ahead of time, completely omitting the salt, and storing them in a airtight containers until needed. Usually 2 or 3 tablespoons of the bulk mix (depending on recipe) equals a packet and the salt already in the gravy mix is enough to allow the flavor of the meat to come through without overwhelming the roast with saltiness.","This is fantastic! I followed the recipe almost to a T. I added more veggies (2 lbs red skin potatoes, 2 sticks of celery, 1 lb of the pealed mini carrots). The other change I made was to bake it instead of crock pot it. I cooking sprayed a dutch oven, added the sliced onion, added the floured check roast, and poured the gravy on top. I put that into an over preheated at 375 for 2 hours, then tossed in the veggies and baked it for another 1 hour. I think this is our new ""default"" pot roast recipe","Although very tender, I thought all of the mixes made it taste very artificially flavored and super salty.","Followed the recipe exactly. It was so easy, and so good. Everyone raved. Next time I will get a much larger roast, since there were no leftovers.","Honestly I don't know what happened. Followed this recipe exactly with the exception of using reduced sodium beef broth in place of water. After waiting all day for it to cook, I was appalled at how salty it was!!! I was really really disappointed and will not make this again.",,,,,,,,,,
171,"I think every Italian family makes this dish, with slight variations of course, within their own family traditions. While this is a fairly standard way of making sausage and peppers, my family uses olive oil rather than butter, uses little or no herbs (fresh basil is always nice here), red wine rather than white, and some crushed or diced canned tomatoes, or marinara sauce. Great on Italian rolls or over a sturdy pasta. This is always a treat!","I have to thank you for a sensational recipe. This is one of those recipes where if you follow the directions and the ingredient list, it's perfect. I've found on this website, that the simplest recipes many times prove to be the best. I'm not an italian, but is this a great recipe!!! Very important that you find good italian sausage. Find a good italian deli if you're lucky enough to have one nearby. I used mild sausage with the fennel seed inside--a key seasoning in good italian sausage. One other thing though, I cooked everything in a dutch oven on the stovetop, and under low heat I left it on the stove for about 45 minutes, and found that the extra time further reduced and caramelized the onions and the redpeppers, which makes this dish even better. I served it with a side of pasta with my favorite Barilla pasta sauce. It doesn't get any better than this recipe. Thanks for sharing one of your favorite family recipes and spreading the love.","Fabulous! I use beer instead of wine, olive oil instead of butter, and a yellow pepper instead of green. I serve this in rolls and it's a family favorite.","Very good. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added a can of crushed tomatoes (14.5 oz). Here is the sum of deviations. First, while the sausage is cooking in the skillet, I put the crushed tomatoes in a dutch oven on low. Then when I sliced up the sausage, I added it to the dutch oven. I then did the onions and the garlic, using olive oil instead of butter. Instead of wine, I used an equal amount of beer. At the step where the peppers and onions are tender, I emptied the skillet into the dutch oven, and let everything simmer on low for 1 hour. The last change was that the sauce was a bit loose, so a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with a tablespoon of water, then added in with everything else. 15 minutes later, done.",Awesome recipe! My Mom showed me how to make sausage and peppers years ago and while I'm not even Italian I definitely LOVE the food! This is pretty much how my Mom taught me except I don't add the basil or oregano. I aslo fry the veggies in olive oil vs. butter. This is great as a side for angel hair pasta with fresh marinara sauce and Italian bread!,"I've made this at least half a dozen times since I discovered it. I always stick to the mild italian sausage because the results are lovely. I vary the colours of the peppers, depending what's on sale, but always use more than is asked for. It's a very simple recipe, tasty and satisfying.","I cut the sausage (used half spicy, half sweet) prior to cooking. (If you cut it slightly frozen, it is much easier to cut without it falling apart, so either don't defrost all the way, or stick into the freezer to slightly freeze) Made these into sandwiches on sub buns and it was excellant! Even more excellant with provolone cheese and creamy italian dressing!","Yummy! :-) Added some black pepper, sea salt (just a lil), and some extra garlic. I also threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms and roma tomatoes. I did not add the tomatoes until just after I threw the sausage back in the pan. Also added a little olive oil in with the white wine. Made a very nice saucy dish, served this over penne pasta and with some crusty galic bread. A nice change from spaghetti!","I used a bag of frozen yellow, red, green pepper and onion mix. I added 1 cup of low sodium vegetable broth. I cooked in the crockpot on low for 2 hours. Sliced into 1/2"" pieces and used in the Pasta Sausage with Italian Sausage recipe from this site and have used this with the Spanish Rice II recipe. This is one of our favorite meals with with rice, pasta or on rolls with sauce and shredded cheese! YUM!",Excellent. We ate this as sandwiches on french bread with marinated cherry tomatoes also from this site and a glass of white wine. My son commented that is was like something you would get from a deli. Update to original review: I make this all the time but I now I always add a can of crushed tomatoes too. They add flavor and body to the sauce. We love this recipe.,"Excellent - brought this to a team meet dinner and it was a hit, esp with the adults! I deviated only slightly from the recipe - I placed a large can of diced tomatoes (seasoned with oregano, basil and garlic)in the slow cooker (on low). I browned 16 sausage links (8 hot/8 sweet) as I cut up one very large spanish onion, 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper & 1 yellow pepper. When the sausage was done I sliced them into chunks and put them in the slow cooker. I added a wee bit of garlic into the pan (after wiping out the sausage fat)and sauteed the garlic & onions, then I added the peppers and a few minutes after that added 1/3 cup of red wine. After most of the wine was cooked into the peppers, I added them to the crockpot and cooked on low for 2 hours. The dish smelled AMAZING and at the dinner later I received rave reviews - I can't wait to make again!","We loved this. Perfect amount of seasonings, I didn't change a thing, other than cooking a bit longer and I did use left over sausages that was cooked on a gas grill - I just sliced it up and added it when I added the wine. Served it next to penna simmered in a red sauce.","I saw this on the Allrecipes homepage and just had to try it! Good thing, because this was a really tasty meal! I served it over rice and used hot Italian sausage because it was all I had. I also subbed oil for the butter. I boiled the sausages while I chopped the onions to get rid of some of the grease and then cut the sausages up after having boiled them to fry in the pan. I was so impressed with how this turned out. Thanks for the recipe!","I tripled this recipe for a large birthday party I was having. I made everything the night before and after cooling, put the large skillet into the fridge. Two hours before my party, I took the skillet out, heated it on the stove until warm, and then put in the crockpot on high until ready to eat (about an hour and a half.)I used 4oz sasuage links and kept them whole so people could make sandwhiches out of it. Put it on a fresh French baguette (so good on this type of bread...the baquette really stands up to the sauce.) This was a huge hit! People went back for 2nds and 3rds....my brother in-law made me pack up the 2 leftover sasuages for him to take home. This is a great recipe to make the day before and put in the crockpot so you can enjoy the party. Bravo!","Easy to do and great in the crock pot, too!","I have always made this, except without garlic, and wow, as a garlic lover, can't believe I missed that one in my recipe! Only thing I kept the same as I do with mine, is 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. This was so good!","Quick, easy and delicious! I add a can of tomato paste cause my italian man like a da sauce. It really is a nice addition and not as thick as you think tomato paste would make it.","I converted the cooking time for a slow cooker, to be able to return home to a cooked meal. I only had sweet sausage so I added red pepper flakes, to taste. Served on any Italian, hoagie, or hard roll, this is wonderful, and can be topped with mozzarella cheese and broiled until cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.","Not sure if my last rating went through, so Ill try again. Great Recipe. Very Tasty. My husband and I are doing a low carb diet so changed it slightly. Used sweet turkey sausage, added a can of diced tomatoes w/ italian seasoning, salt and pepper. did not use the red onion. Also added a pinch of hot pepper spice. VERY YUMMY.","This makes fabulous sandwiches. I remove the casings from the sausages and roll them into meatballs. Once I have cooked the sausage and veggies I split Italian sub buns and put them under broiler on low with some mozzarella. It makes a great meatball sandwich! I suppose you could top the sandwich with some tomato sauce, if that's your thing. But it's great without too.","Delicious. We loved it. Followed the author's advice and used half sweet and half hot Italian Sausage and it was excellent. I also used a mix of green, red, orange and yellow bell peppers (pers pref) and vidalia in place of the yellow onion. We all loved the addition of the basil and oregano and thought the amount of these herbs was perfect. My son put his on Italian Bread and my daughter and I ate it as is. Excellent dinner. Thanks for sharing!","I've made this many times and it's always a winner. The only change I make is at the very end when I add a can of seasoned diced tomatoes, undrained. As soon as everything is hot, I serve over spagetti, or penne, or bow tie pasta. Super!!!","I needed a quick side dish and had very little in the house, so made this without the sausage. Used olive oil instead of butter and fresh basil instead of dried. It was quite good, I'll definitely make it again with the sausage next time.","Good recipe. I cheated and used packaged sausage that was already cooked and red wine instead of white and it turned out great. Also, I found that if I let it simmer for longer than 15 mins, around 25 mins or so, on a low heat setting the onions and peppers really soaked up the wine and were not at all crunchy, they almost melt in your mouth.","This was such an easy meal. I browned 3 links of Hot Italian sausage and 3 links of Sweet Italian sausage in a pan with some olive oil then removed and sliced them into pieces. I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic and one Vidalia onion to the pan and sautéed them. I added the peppers to the pan and about a half a bottle of Sam Adams White Ale to the mix. I added the sausage and 3 torn leaves of fresh basil to the pan and let that simmer for 15 minutes until it all reduced. I was really nervous when I added the onions and garlic since the aroma was so potent that I had to open all the windows to let in some fresh air. After I added the peppers, beer and sausage and covered it, the smell dissipated and turned the dish into a wonderfully sweet yet spicy dish. I served it on torpedo rolls with American cheese (all I had) and French fries on the side. This will be added into my regular rotation. Thanks GiGi9801!!!!",The only change I made was to follow the recommendation of others and use beer in place of the wine and extra virgin olive oil in place of butter. Yummy!,This is a wonderful and quick dish. Very tasty! Made as is and will do so over and over!,This was very good insteasd of cutting up the sausage I put it on a roll and it was great the best I have ever had.,,,,,,,,
172,"I think a good start to any a la vodka sauce is the pancetta. I started this recipe by browning 6 slices of pancetta without any oil and adding the sausage to the drippings, then launched into everything else. I also upped the vodka quantity to 1/4 of a cup and upped the heavy cream to 3/4 of a cup. I completely omitted the salt. I used Contadina crushed tomatos with roasted garlic. The meal was definitely ""restaurant quality""","This recipe is top-notch and would rival any Penne a la Vodka that you'd order in an Italian restaurant. I prepared it almost to the letter, and it was perfect. I have also tried this a different way by making it a lowfat dish. I substituted turkey sausage, and instead of heavy cream, I used half and half blended with 1 tsp. of corn starch. It was a fantastic lower fat variation and tasted just as good as the original.","I changed this recipe. 3 tablespoons of white wine instead of vodka, added spinach, tomato sauce and extra red pepper flakes, simmered the sauce 30 minutes and melted parmesean and feta cheese. made for a large group. got rave reviews, tasted just like penne rosa from noodles and company!","I frequently do a sausage pasta with a fresh sauce but never occurred to me to do a vodka cream version. Great! My only alteration is in the pasta choice. Pardon, but I am a particular snob in this area. For a sauce like this one with roll-away chunks, a more appropriate pasta choice is one that snuggles the sauce - in this case I go for an egg noodle or at least the widest fettuccine you can find. Tubed pasta work better on thinner sauces that need a little traveling compartment.",This was good although I have had better sauces but I must say I liked the addition of the sausage. It actually tasted better the next day. I would make it again. The ony thing is I reduced the oil and the salt I felt the amounts given were high.,"All the signs of greatness: Tastes really good, is fast and easy, and also pretty darn inexpensive! I went a little easy on the crushed red pepper (it was still nice and spicy), and topped each serving with a little shredded fresh Romano. SERIOUS YUM, especially with a glass of red wine...","I browned the sausage separately and then added it to the sauce. For the sauce I sauteed some onion, used 1/4 c. of vodka, 1 c. of whipping cream, and added some fresh basil. Overall, I think the sauce is better without the sausage.","My family loved this. I thought it was very similar to Bowties w/Sausage, Tomatoes & Cream (also on this site) and may consider using that recipe as my base vodka sauce. I followed the directions pretty accurately with only a few minor changes. I put literally a drop of EVOO into the pan and browned my sausage whole. I think 2 links crumbled as written would have been lost in the sauce. I drained the oil and fat from the pan reserving about 1-1/2 Tbsp. in the pan for flavor. I cut down to 1/2 the amount of red pepper to make it more kid-friendly. I also cut back dramatically on the parsley. As I was chopping it I realized that it was a lot so I sprinkled it little by little until I got the flavor I wanted. I ended up using a little over a tbsp I would guess. My only other change was to use a little over a half pound of a variety of pastas.(finished up the boxes) I served it with grated parm and think that next time I may add it to the sauce during cooking for a much better flavor. The flavor of the dish was good but I definitely recommend increasing the vodka A LOT! You could barely taste it. Also I think I prefer my vodka sauce a bit more creamier than tomato-ey so next time I will definitely add more cream to the dish as well. Overall this was a very delicious dish and was loved by my whole family. My 22 month old went back for thirds!! It does make a lot of sauce so be prepared for extra...perfect for dipping garlic bread into. Thank you Star!","This was wonderful and so quick and easy!! I did drain the sausage and also added the cream after bringing the vodka to a boil (wasn't sure about cream boiling and curdling). I only had hot italian sausage on hand, and it was great - next time I'll try the sweet! This was very similiar to 'Rigatoni ala vodka' my husband and I used to order at a local restaurant - also good with the addition of chicken breast cooked in the sausage grease (sounds weird but tastes great). Thanks for the recipe!!","In spite of the good reviews this recipe gets, neither DH nor I was a big fan. Maybe we just don't like vodka sauce. Had only had it once before (the jarred stuff from Trader Joe's), but still wasn't that enthralled with it from scratch. I halved the amount of EVOO; used spicy Italian sausage, so halved the red pepper flakes; also halved the salt based on other reviewers' comments, and halved the amount of pasta for just two of us (still had leftovers). Used fire-roasted crushed tomatoes, and threw in a bit of prosciutto with the sausage for some additional flavor. Served with shredded parmesan and whole wheat sourdough rolls. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Star!","So easy and very tasty, this is easier to make than my usual spaghetti sauce. Loved it and my family loved it! This is a keeper! I made it exactly as stated minus the parsley.","I've made this a few times now... My husband and I LOVE it. Made it exactly as written a few times, but lately I've modified it slighty. I now add tsp of Basil and 1/8 cup of sugar... just to add a bit of sweetness to the sauce. I've started using 1/2 and 1/2 cream. Tastes wonderful. Thanks so much for sharing!","Delish! I used 1/4 C non-fat milk and 1 T low fat cream cheese instead of the cream, and it still tasted great, and cut the calories/fat down significantly.","The flavor of this sauce was outstanding. We bought some high quality vodka, and that made quite a difference. Also, we were happy to find the mini ""airline"" versions of the vodka so we could get good quality without spending a ton. There are a couple things I would change next time I make the sauce, though: 1. I would use more sausage. We couldn't even tell it was in there. And 2. Use tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes to make the sauce a little thicker, it was really thin, and for a creamier texture. But, delicious nonetheless, and we look forward to making this recipe again!","Very good for never having made it before. Extraneous comment: I don't know how people can rate a recipe, after changing it so much it's not the same recipe. Especially giving it a poor rating. Make the recipe as stated, THEN rate it. Much better for the rest of us who rely on accurate ratings.","Absolutely delicious. Rave reviews, and it tastes just like what you'd get at a restaurant. Thank you!","Yum, yum yum! I added a bit of dried oregano and rosemary, used just a sprinkle of salt, left the sausage whole (for those who didn't want any). I simmered the dish with 1/4 cup of vodka for a good 30 minutes. Added a generous splash more with the cream in step 4. This one's going into my tried & true file. Thanks, Star Pooley!","If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would it is the BEST! Every time I make this every one is raving and asking for the recipe. A few tricks of the trade, use a whole pound of ground sausage (spicy ot mild to taste), 6 cloves FRESH garlic, a whole cup of whipping cream, 1/3 cup vodka, and use Delmonte 4 cheese sauce (usually 99cents in a can) AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Try it out you will not be dissapointed.",Very Good! I also reduced the oil and salt and just noticed that another person did the same thing.,"Easy, flavorful and restaurant-quality. Basic assembly but not so basic taste! Easy add in to the weekly menu. Followed instructions exactly with the exception of subbing chicken sausage for Italian sausage to save some cal/fat grams. Was awesome for food-lover and picky-eaters alike.",This sauce was as good if not better than some I have had in restaurants. I didn't even remove the sausage from the casing..just cut it up into small discs and browned it.,Love this! have made it several times - as written and with spicy sausage instead of sweet. Huge hit w/my family. Thanks for sharing,"This recipe was exceptionally easy, and incredibly delicious. Rather than use italian sausage, I opted to brown boneless pork chops in 2 tbsp butter/ dash of olive oil, and allowed them to braise in the tomato sauce for approx 2 hours before I added the vodka and cream. I know it sounds a little odd, but there is nothing better than a fork tender pork chop with spaghetti! I also added additional garlic, onions, shredded parm cheese, and fresh basil right before serving. 5 stars!",This was excellant. I was surprised with the flavor of the sauce considering the short cooking time. With the exception of using ff cream I made the recipe exactly as written.,Very delicious. The sauce is to die for. Try it once and you will be making it over and over. It has a restaurant quality.,I love this recipe. I always use more than 2 links of sausage (for 8 servings... 2 seems like way too small of an amlount!) and use hot italian sausage and then just leave out the red pepper flakes. Otherwise I do not change a thing. It is one of my favorite quick and easy recipes and it really impresses people!,"This was awesome, everyone loved it, even better the next day. The only thing I would do away with was the amount of oil to cook the sausage, made it a little to greasy for me, but really good taste","This sauce is so good!! I used turkey sausage the second time I made it, just to make it a little healthier, and you couldn't tell the difference!","1/20/12-Used 1lb of ground meat, put in basil and italian seasoning....increased vodka to 1/2c and cream to 1 1/2c.....added parmesan cheese, oregano, onion powder....might try can of tom sauce next time and fettuccine noodles and really only need to use 1/2 box of penne","I have made this MANY times, and I'm convinced this has to be the BEST Penne alla Vodka recipe on this site. I tried another tonight and it didn't compare.",,,,,,
173,"SO EASY AND SO GOOD! I made a few modifications: Using a 7.25lb Bone-in Turkey Breast I layered the bottom of my crockpot with 3 cut-up celery stalks, one sweet yellow onion, 1/4 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 tbsp. minced garilc. I placed the turkey breast on top of the celery and onion, rubbed the turkey inside and out with the onion soup packet (lifting up the skin on top of the breast and adding the seasoning right on the meat works great!), also rubbed some oregano, sage, thyme, and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic on the breast. Drizzled the breast with 1 tbsp. melted butter. Cooked on high 1 hour, low for 7 hours more. Perfect moist turkey! Smells and tastes great, plenty of leftovers for sandwiches, casseroles, or enchiladas! Will be a simple cold-weather staple for me.","I like to put just enough water to cover the bottom of the crockpot. Place the turkey in, surround it with quartered onions and carrots, brush the bird with melted butter and then season it well. This makes a delicious turkey breast and I use the leftover turkey breast for casseroles, etc. in the future as it freezes well. The broth can be strained and used as well. Thank you.","This was so easy and came out absolutely delish! I think I'll make this regularly to have turkey for sandwiches during the week -- way better than cold cuts and you don't have to do the whole Thanksgiving turkey thing to get it! This would also be a great way to make extra white meat for a holiday when you're worried that your turkey won't be enough. I put about a half a cup of white wine in the bottom of the crock pot, added some thickly sliced carrots, a sliced onion, about 4 stalks of choppped celery and a couple garlic cloves. Added salt and pepper, placed the turkey breast on top, with the onion soup spread on it and under the skin and cooked it on low for 8 hours. When it was done, I sauteed some mushrooms (4 containers: two each Baby Bellas and shitakes, sliced), onion and garlic in a little olive oil and butter in a skillet, then added 1/2 cup white wine and about 2 cups of the broth from the crock pot. I brought that to a boil and mixed another half cup of broth with a couple tablespoons corn starch to make a ""slurry"". I added that to the skillet and it was so delicious over the turkey! Thanks for a great recipe!!","This is wonderful! I did not know you could cook turkey breast in a slow cooker like this. If you're like me, you'll probably be tempted to add stock or liquid to the meat -- DON'T! Believe me there'll be plenty of wonderful juices to make gravy from. If you just don't feel comfortable cooking it dry you can add about 1 Tbsp of melted butter (which is what I did) and you'll be totally happy with the result. Instead of using bone-in breast I used a piece of cut-off breast meat and it's still plenty yummy! Great for making sandwich or salad turkey meat. Try this recipe if you don't feel like turning on the oven and heating up the kitchen and potentially trying your bird.",This was my first turkey I've ever made and it turned out great. I am cooking for two so I used a 3 lb boneless turkey breast. I forgot to buy the dry onion soup mix so I spinkled onion powder and Italian seasoning on the turkey breast. I cooked for 1 hour on high and then left it on low for another 3 hours and it turned out perfectly! I will definitely be making it this way again.,"Moist and very tasty. I will be cooking many more turkey breasts in my slow cooker. It is August and it is too hot to cook. This is another good recipe that doesn't heat up the kitchen. I cooked a 7 lb. breast and used onion powder, marjoram, garlic pepper, dried parsley and salt. As someone suggested, I put a few pats of butter in the cooker. My slow cooker only heats from the bottom, so I didn't want the meat to stick before the drippings were released. I cooked mine 3 hours on high. I will be using this for turkey enchiladas, sandwiches, and just as is. No more turkey cold cuts for me. This is too easy and tastes a zillion times better.",I am totally amazed at the 'brilliance' of those who 'review' a recipe after adding (in one case 9) so many ingredients that it doesn't even resemble the simple and delicious recipe that was shared! Get real folks....send in your own recipe and leave the others alone!!!!!!!,"This recipe was a lifesaver for me! I'm living on an island outside the US and had to drive 40 miles just to buy a frozen turkey breast, expecting to roast it in the oven for guests Thanksgiving evening. On Thanksgiving morning, I discovered we had no gas for the oven. So I found this recipe, had the onion mix on hand, and put it all in the slow cooker. Seven hours later, I had a perfectly cooked turkey breast. Perfect for nervous first-time Thanksgiving hostesses!!",This was excellent. Made it for a dinner party and every person there asked me how I did it. I accidently set the crockpot to high and noticed 4 hours later when the turkey was done! I turned it to keep warm and left the turkey in there for another 3 hours. turned out great but good to know you can cook bird faster in a pinch.,"This is simple and delicious, and certainly not rocket science--no need to really add anything or change anything other than the cooking time. Rub the turkey breast all over with a couple tablespoons of butter before adding the onion soup. Mine was done perfectly at 5-1/2 hours, so for those who complained this was dry it was only because the meat was cooked too long, and an instant read meat thermometer might be helpful--you want the temperature to read around 170 degrees. For a lovely pan gravy, strain the drippings into a saucepan with some chicken stock mixed with cornstarch and cook till thickened. The meat is tender, juicy, and delicately seasoned by the onion soup mix, which also lent a nice flavor to the gravy. Since there are just the two of us, we had beautiful slices of turkey breast leftover for sandwiches, as well as the carcass which I froze to make turkey soup. Update 3/16/09: I used a much smaller turkey breast this time, about 4-1/2 pounds, and at 5-1/2 hours it still was past the 170 degrees I wanted. I think I've got this figured out now and from now on I'm going to use the rule of thumb to cook on low for slightly less than an hour for each pound of turkey breast.",Very moist. Had I known turkey breast could be cooked so moist I'd have made it many times over. I rubbed turkey with olive oil before the onion soup and put a little white wine and a dash of Maggi in the pot. Who knew it could be so easy!,"Help!! I was so excited to try this. Is the problem with slow cookers that do or do not have a heating element on the sides? How could I go wrong w/just a turkey breast and dry onion? I'm still a novice . After 7 hrs. on low, my turkey was as dry as could be and all the juice filled my 7 qt more than halfway. I would have prefered the juice inside the turkey. Any comments aprpeciated..I really needed this recipe. THanks","5 stars for the cooking method alone! I have been using this recipie for a while now but just now getting around to rating it. I am not a fan of onion soup mix so my take on this is to rub the breast in butter, season with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning and lay it on a bed of chopped onion and celery. I also add a cup of chicken broth, and by doing this I get a yield of about 4 cups of perfectly seasoned broth(with veggies) in the end ..that is fabulous for adding to your fav dry stuffing mix and/or strain some and make gravy with it! Throw it all in the slow cooker and have Thanksgiving like dinner at your finger tips when you get home. It's a no fail recipie! I will never roast another turkey breast. My boys smile from ear to ear when they see me starting this in the morning.. because they know their dinner will be sublime. Thankyou for the wonderful idea ms_sally!","This was great, but due to the new gov't regulated temperatures on the slow cookers, it needs to be cooked for a shorter amount of time. Low is 200 degrees, high is 300. The old temps were 185 and 212 respectively I believe. So, if you cook this for 7-9 hours, even on low depending on the size, you will overcook it, and it will be dry. This goes for most of your old slow cooker recipes if you have a slow cooker made in the last five years. You should make this on a weekend, and check the temperature as you go to see when it comes to the safer temperature of 165. Then you will have an accurate guage of how hot your slow cooker is cooking at.","Delicious! I've never had turkey this tender! And no, you don't need any liquid! Just make sure your slow cooker insert allows for dry cooking. My old KitchenAid slow cooker insert cracked both times I was making this. It worked out just fine in a cast aluminum insert. HINT: You can make your own onion soup mix! 8 tsp. dry minced onion 2 tsp. onion powder 4 tsp. beef bouillon or 4 cubes Black pepper (optional)","Believe it or not but I take my turkey breast directly out of the freezer and put it in the crock pot for about 10 hours or so. I put onoins, carrots, paprika salt and pepper. It is so tender and so versitile.","This is an excellent way to prepare a small turkey. Using a 5lb boneless breast, I cooked it on high 3 hours and on low for 2 hours, inserting a meat thermometer every so often. I altered the recipe a bit: 1/2 cup turkey broth on the bottom of the cooker produces a rich, delicious broth fit for gravy. I covered the turkey with virgin olive oil and rubbed on salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning (no onion soup). This was the moistest turkey and so very tender. Absolutely perfect! Rave comments from every guest at the table. This is the only way I'll prepare turkey from now on. Fool-proof!","Just reference for anyone with a smaller weight breast. Put a 2.5 lb boneless breast in a rival crockpot on low (10hr) setting only, and it had a pop up timer which was great so I could actually see when it was finished cooking, and it took exactly 3 hours and ten minutes.","This has been a famuily favorite for years. The only thing I do different is to add a can of cranberry sauce, pouring it over the turkey before I start the slow cooker. It makes the most delicious gravy, all ready to serve when the turkey is done.","This is a wonderful recipe. The only way I will do a turkey breast from now on. I used a Honeysuckle White turkey breast with the gravy packet inside the cavity. I did Pam spray the inside of my 6-quart slow cooker. I used a 7.5 lb. turkey breast and cooked it for 1 hr. 15 min. on High and 7 hr. and 15 min. on Low. The meat was tender and moist. I didn't have much falling off the bone and the breasts sliced beautifully. The gravy that came from the juices was delicious. There will be about an inch or two of turkey juices left in the slow cooker after you remove the turkey breast. Pour them off into a large saucepan. Whisk all the ingredients listed below together and then pour into the large saucepan with the turkey juices. Whisk constantly over med.-high heat until it boils. 2 c. water, 9 T. Wondra flour for sauces and gravy, the gravy packet that comes in the turkey breast cavity, 14.5 oz. can Swanson's lower sodium chicken broth, 1 T. Kitchen Bouquet, black pepper, to taste. Note: If you prefer, you can just add all the gravy ingredients to the slow cooker. Cover and turn to HIGH. It will take the gravy about 1-1/2 hours to come to a boil.",You can avoid buttering the crock pot by putting 3 or 4 balls of crumpled aluminum foil on the bottom of your crock pot. This lifts the turkey and prevents any sticking.,"I have cooked turkey breasts this way for quite awhile now. I also have added some store bought stuffing and put it in the bottom of the crockpot, put cram of mushroom soup over the stuffing and placed the turkey breast with seasonings on top and then cooked all day. Delicioso, just like turkey and stuffing and very moist.","First, let me state that I am a lazy cook. I admit it. So this recipe excited me! Two ingredients and a crockpot. What could be better. I dumped a half thawed bone-in turket breast and topped it with a package of Onion Soup mix in the CP one afternoon about 3 PM and turned the CP on Low. I let it cook all through the night and the next morning I took it out and wrapped it in foil. Just like that. That evening, I took the foil wrapped breast and plopped it in a baking pan and stuck it in the oven on 325. I let it reheat while I cooked some other stuff and played Hearts on the computer. Right before dinner I unwrapped the breast and sliced it up. My husband declared it the best turkey he'd ever eaten in our 22 years of marriage. Thanks for posting this recipe...I plan to make this a regular recipe in my personal rotation.","AS per reviewer when cooking for 2: use 3 lb turkey breast, Cook on high for 1 hr then low for 3 hrs","I've been doing turkey breast in the crock pot for years. I use cream of chicken soup or chicken broth and then make gravy for mashed potatoes. If the breast comes with a gravy packet, just dump it in too.For the novice, the breast ribs are up.","I had never thought of cooking a turkey breast in the slow cooker, and it worked GREAT! I used a 3 lb. boneless breast on top of some carrots, celery and onions...and since I didn't have soup mix, I sprinkled it with garlic salt, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. I did add about a cup of chicken broth, since boneless breasts don't have as much juice. Cooked it for about 6 hours. It was juicy, delicious, and won rave reviews.",,,,,,,,,,
174,"The flavor seems to come primarily from fat and salt. To make this more healthy and more flavorful, try the following: 1. spray the dish with non-stick spray rather than using butter 2. reduce the butter for sauteeing to 2 teaspoons 3. replace the milk with 1 cup of reduced sodium, fat-free chicken broth and 1 cup of low-fat evaporated milk 4. add 1/2 teaspoon (or more) of crushed marjoram or thyme leaves 5. add 1/8 teaspoon of ground red pepper to the roux and reduce the butter in the roux (you can cut in half and still successfully blend in the flour). Also, add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg to the roux. This is standard for a white sauce. 6. Use light cheese for the topping, preferably highly flavored such as asiago or extra sharp cheddar.","5 stars with these adjustments: Spray baking dish with cooking spray instead of butter. Double recipe for 9 x 13 pan. Added 1tsp each:thyme nutmeg and crushed red pepper. Doubled garlic. Minced mushrooms (So the kids wouldn't know!!) Put a splash of white wine in with the veggies as the sauteed. Omitted peas (don't like them). Added 1/4 cup of parmesan ,1/4 package of cream cheese and half the cheddar cheese to the sauce.Added 1/2cup of quartered cherry tomatoes. Topped with remaining cheese then topped with corn flakes instead of bread crumb mixture. IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!!!!We loved it from ages3 to 31!","I think that with two changes this is a five star recipe. Add a chicken boullion cube to your cream sauce, which adds a LOT of flavor, and top with french fried onions instead of the bread crumbs. I will NEVER go back to casserole out of a can--this is absolutely delicious and the leftovers are even better!","We think this dish has a lot of potential, and I'm sure I'll make it again. As is, however, it's just sort of...blah. I kept adding salt in an effort to stir up the flavors, but it just didn't happen. Before attempting this again, I'll figure out what seasonings will work to make it more flavorful. My husband did comment that it doesn't have the typical soup taste to it, which is a great thing! 4-11-06: I made this again tonight, and it was a lot better! I added some fresh dill, as dill is really good paired with just about any fish. I also tripled the amounts of garlic and black pepper that went into it; it was very flavorful this time around. I've added this to my recipe book with my additions.","It's a keeper! I did make some shortcuts: after I finished the mushrooms, I added the butter then the flour right to the mushroom mix. I cooked that for about 3-5 minutes and then added the milk. After the noodles cooked for 4 minutes, I added the frozen peas to the pot and cooked the peas and noodles together for another 4 minutes. After draining both, I put the tuna in the noodle pot, poured the noodles and peas on top, added the cheese and stirred. Then I added the mushroom mix, stirred and put it all in a casserole dish. I omitted the salt from the recipe and topped the casserole with crushed potato chips as I didn't have bread crumbs. I love recipes that don't include a ""cream of something"" can of soup! (I used leftover haddock from the fridge and it was great; I suppose you could use any fish!)","This recipe is good as it is. If it was meant to not have butter, then it wouldn't. Never understood why some people feel the need to critisize a recipe for being unhealthy, there are hosts of ""healthy"" recipes to be found. Some of us like butter!","This is really great and SUPER easy. I only changed one thing, and that was substituting 2 cans of chicken in place of the tuna..(for some reason people here think they don't like hot tuna!;)) I think I'd also make a bit more of the gravy mixture next time because I'd have liked it a little creamier, but considering I didn't really put exactly 8oz of noodles in, (dumped more on accident)it is probably the reason it wasn't as creamy. Anyway, excellent recipe. Thanks for submitting it!","Why is that casserole recipes never call for enough sauce? When I mixed everything together, prior to baking, it looked quite nice and juicy. I should have stopped there and eaten the dish as pasta with tuna sauce. The baking dried it out completely. I would also suggest using more tuna as to me it tasted more like a 'peas in white sauce with pasta casserole'. I am also always suspicious when recipes call for a flour-thickened sauce to put over pasta. They ususally turn out too 'bready'. I think it would be nicer to use thick cream instead of milk here, and omit the flour. Also, more spices and herbs would be nice, I think. Garlic, parsley and lemon would make it more interesting. The way it's written it's a bit bland and definitely dry and I am not looking forward to finishing the leftovers tomorrow night.","I have been making a similar tuna noodle casserole for years. I dislike canned soups very much and never use them. To me they all have a chemical taste that permiates the food. I always make my own bechamel sauce for this casserole. For those that substitute chicken broth and canned non-stick spray, that's fine if you like it that way, but it totally changes the recipe. Butter and milk add the richness and creaminess. If you're worried about calories, make something else!",Awesome recipe! Tastes sooo much better than the canned cream of whatever tuna casserole recipes I've had to eat before (Sorry Mom). Definitely worth the extra effort to make from scratch.,"I made this a couple days ago as I'm trying to get more fish in our diets. I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I substituted some garlic powder for the clove of garlic and I used two 4-oz cans of sliced mushrooms as I forgot to buy some fresh ones. I also used some crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs, and I probably used more like two cups of cheese on top. Oh, very tasty! I cooked it up in an 8"" square glass baking dish, and it was almost overfull! I think it could use something else, too. It wasn't bland so much as just lacking... something. But it is much better than the soup-from-a-can casseroles that I have been making, although I won't make this all the time simply because it takes longer to make. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)","Excellent! Tuna Casserole is not one of hubby's favorite meals. The kids and I like it so I was determined to find a recipe that he would enjoy as well. This is the one! When I mentioned to him that I would be trying another recipe, his only request was to add a little more tuna and leave out the peas. I used half button and half baby bella mushrooms, deglazed the pan with approx. 1/4 cup white wine with the mushrooms and added a handful of Durkee fried onions during the last 5 - 10 minutes in the oven. Everyone loved it and we will enjoy this often. Thanks for sharing!!","We made this twice. The first time we were so impressed. The second time we were bored w/ it so I froze part and the other part just sits in the refrigerator. It is kinda boring. It takes time to make the roux. We are not just ""dying"" to make it again soon. Canned mushrooms help this dish even for those who are not mushroom lovers. Luis puts lot of Tapatio hot sauce on this dish to eat it even though we put habeneros in the mix. This dish has been tying up too many plastic lunch portables. Luis & I are gonna have to bite the bullet and eat it to have more dishes available.","I only made one change in this recipe and that was using chopped fresh broccoli instead of peas as we do not like peas. I used whole wheat pasta in this casserole as well as homemade bread crumbs. We thought this was okay, but bland. My husband thought that this would have been better with more cheese and I thought it could use a little spicing up. As is, good start but I think it could be played with a bit and made tastier without so much fat.","Made this today for dinner and it was outstanding. To cut down on the pans used to prepare this, I sauted the vegetable in the skillet as directed then melted the additional butter and added the flour to the same skillet, let it cook for a few minutes and added the milk. Worked wonderfully! Cooked the noodles, drained them and added everything to that same pot to mix together. No more dishes than homemade mac and cheese! I mixed panko and cheese together for the topping, no butter. Everyone loved it!","This recipe turned out very well, but you are definitely on your own for how to season it. I decided to use a combination of 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp. black pepper, 1/2 tsp. dill, 1 tsp. dried mustard, 1 tsp. parsley, and a 1/2 tsp of vegetable Better Than Bouillon to give it some zip. I also used tripled the minced garlic and substituted half chicken broth for part of the milk. For the topping, I doubled the bread crumbs to 6 T and kept the amount of butter at 2 T.","This was delicious! I'm lactose and gluten intolerant so I substituted GF flour, funsilli noodles, and bread crumbs for the normal wheat-based ingredients. I also used LF veggie cheddar shreds, smart balance lite, and almond milk in place of the other dairy-based ingredients. It turned out beautifully. Highly reccommend",This was awesome! I cut down a little bit on the butter. I added some of the cheese to the sauce mixture and used crush up croutons for the topping with no butter. Was looking for ultimate comfort food and this was it! Took a little work but worth it for the lower fat and sodium I was looking for since I used skim milk and light cheese. Will definitley make again!,"My family loved it! It was my first time making a tuna casserole, but it's definetly a keeper in the monthly menu. Since we are not really health conscious, I substituted milk for cream and it made the whole deal incredibly smooth. I also added thyme and nutmeg as suggested by some reviewers, and threw in a bunch of quartered cherry tomatoes just before putting it into the stove. Thanks!","I agree with cooknggardener about there being way too much fat.....the recipe tasted VERY starchy as written. Adding chicken stock in place of 1/2 the milk and substituting the rest with evaporated milk adds so much more flavor, and cutting down on the butter cuts fat without affecting taste. Adding herbs and seasonings (whatever you like) is also a must. Ways to make it even healthier - cut the cheese in half and use a highly flavorful type, like extra sharp cheddar (you'll never miss the other half); use whole wheat egg noodles; use canned wild Alaskan salmon (great brand available at Costco) instead of tuna. Even though it needs changes I rated this recipe 4 stars just because of the fact that it teaches/encourages people to omit processed canned soup (yuck!) =)","I would just like to say BRAVO for stressing the fact that this is a ""from scratch"" recipe. I'm American but have lived in France for 27 years and have long ago stopped using commercially packaged ingredients in my cooking, first because of unavailability and then by choice, even though some of that stuff in now available. I wish all the recipes on this site that are from scratch were tagged somehow to indicate that fact. Thanks for the great recipe!",This dish was excellent. It was tasty and such an upgrade from the canned soup variety. It was worth the effort. I really liked the simple sauce. I will make this again,"I made a huge amount of this in a pan (bigger than 9x13, it's more like 12x16 or something)._____________________ I followed recipe but did the following adjustments/additions: 1 large bag egg noodles, 4 cans tuna, 2 small onions, 1 carton mushrooms, 3/4c flour (added a little more later to thicken sauce), 3c milk, half bag frozen peas. I put some shredded cheddar in with the sauce, along with 1can cream of mushroom soup, 1 bullion cube, 1 packet of ranch powder, and 1 packet of garlic&herb powder. ______After everything was cooked/added together into the sauce, put it into the cooking spray coated pan and covered the top with bread crumbs and then shredded cheddar. 375 for 25min seemed to be fine. It still could have used a little more flavor, I can't imagine doing this exactly like the recipe says with no seasoning... I think more cheese in the sauce (or a different sauce recipe) would make this even better.","Really good tuna noodle casserole. Make a couple changes though. Used cooking spray in the baking pan instead of butter. When cooking down the veggies, I added a 1/4c of chicken broth and cooked down along with some spices. And in the white sauce i cut down the amount of milk, added a 1/4c of low fat cream cheese, and also added nutmeg. I also omitted the bread crumbs and butter topping and just used the cheddar cheese. Two thumbs up from the hubbie.",""" . . . from Scratch"" is the relative indicator! I live in the middle of nowhere and could not get to a store to make what I was feeling, which was Tuna Casserole. So when I came upon this one it appealed to me since I had the basic ingredients . . . and I love things that are ""real"". I mean cream of mushroom soup is awesome! truly! an American institution along with Campbells, but I did not have the little cans. I loved the recipe! it was creamy and warm for a fall nite, and it was easy over all. Ok here goes the whining. No, I am not going to whine about all the butter. I live in Wisconsin, are you kidding, I live to use real butter! No I am not going to mention one ingredient or another . . .ok, what became the negative for me was, I dirtied 3 pans . . . and lots of other utensils . . . etc. and I hate washing dishes and I do not have a dishwasher at the old farm!!!! The other thing, the Casserole was a bit dry . . .not sure what I did wrong, I wanted creamy . . . The substitues I made: I used zucchini instead of peas, since I did not have peas. I used more spices and herbs . . . I added red and green peppers . . . carrots, all minced fine----I will try the recipe again! Thank you for sharing!","I made this dish in one pot (except for cooking the noodles) as I think it improves the flavour. Experiment! After frying mushrooms add the second amount of butter to the same pan then the flour as well. This way you're not losing all those delicious browned bits. Stir the milk in right away (slowly) stirring constantly to avoid lumps as it will thicken fast. Throw your peas, cooked noddles, tuna, chedar, etc, right into the same pan. I added some fresh parley and tarrogon along with my S&P as I had it on hand. Pour into a deep casserole dish. Add remaining butter to the same pan and stir in the bread crumbs. Sprinkle on top and bake! I baked this for a lot longer than recommended. First for 30 minutes with the lid on as some reviews said it was dry, then I took the lid off and baked for another 20 minutes. Great recipe though, I had fun playing with it thank you!",,,,,,,,,,

176,"I made this as written, and we enjoyed it. However, if I were to make it again, I would use a hot tangy English mustard (we could barely taste the Dijon), decrease the amount of honey (too sweet for my taste), and use more pecans and less breadrcrumbs (making it more crunchy and flavorsome). The '10 minute per inch of thickness' baking suggestion was absolutely spot-on. Thank you, Christine!","Really good. After I mixed the mustard, butter and honey I refrigerated it for about 15 minutes so that it thickened. It stayed on the salmon better as it was not so runny. Then I pressed the bread crumb mixture into it. I also used a little extra parsley for more color.","I am completely addicted to this! I used already prepared honey mustard (I bought from tastefully simple), mixed the bread crumbs in with the mustard mixture it was FANTASTIC! Thank goodness my Dad goes Salmon fishing & shares his catch with me (it's best with fresh Salmon). Thanks so much Chris, this is better than what I've paid $25 for in a resturant!","There is one word to describe this dish-- Delicious! I added a little garlic powder to the mustard and honey sauce, marinated it about an hour, than added the bread crumbs and pecans prior to baking.",EASY!!!! Very classy and delicious!! I make it all the time---I keep a container of the pecan topping in my freezer. All I do is spoon on the mustard and sprinkle on the ready-made topping and bake. Awesome.,Easy to prepare and nice taste. I used walnuts instead of pecans. This recipe is very similar to the Baked Dijon Salmon recipe on this site as well.,My husband and I both loved this dish! I halved the recipe and used a 1-pound fillet instead of the six small ones. There was a little bit too much mustard--next time I will add a bit more honey and take away a bit of mustard. But we will definitely be making this again. And it's so easy!,"DE-LI-CIOUS!!! Such a great, tasty and elegant recipe, and so easy to make!!!. I reserved some of the mustard-honey mixture, and served in on top of the salmon once it was done. My 22 month old daughter LOVED it, thanks for a great recipe!","Fabulous! Compares to a superb salmon dinner in a seafood restaurant. We all loved it. However, I only used about half of the sauce. Will make less next time.",To die for!! Thanks for the recipe!,"I've been making this recipe since 2002. It's my daughter's favorite meal. I serve it to guests as well as just the family, and it always gets rave reviews. Be sure to use fresh parsley instead of dried - there's a definite difference in flavor. I always use a 2 pound center cut piece of salmon and prepare it early. After putting the topping on the fish, I refrigerate it. I also prepare twice baked potatoes ahead of time and refrigerate those along with asparagus coated with olive oil and garlic salt. When dinner time rolls around, I bake the salmon and potatoes and grill the asparagus on a grill pan - dinner in 20 mins with no fuss! Great for company!","I love seafood and this recipe is headed straight to my top 5 seafood favorites! I recommend making it just the way it's written the first time. I see a lot of reviewers suggesting a bit more of this, less of that, and I understand that we all have our own preferences, but really this was very good as written and the perfect baseline, even if you do tweak a bit.","A very elegant salmon! This was wonderful and great tasting. Preparation time was approximate and everything was easy to prepare. I did tone down on the amount of mustard to 2 T, and butter to 2T, melted. I increased the honey to sweeten up the sauce (personal preference). I seasoned the salmon with a little sea salt and black pepper and then marinated the salmon in the honey, butter, mustard for 6 hours. In a food processor I pulsed fresh italian parsley, 1/4 cup white bread crumbs, and 1 cup organic raw pecans. I pressed the crumb mixture into the salmon before baking at 400 degrees. It took a little longer in baking time because I had thicker cuts of salmon. The results were absolutely amazing! The salmon was light, flaky, sweet and flavorful. I could taste a subtle hint of the dijon mustard. The pecans added a nice texture to the coating of salmon. I served this over a bed of, ""Quick and Easy Sautee Spinach,"" and ""Mushroom Rice,"" all from this website. I will put this in my recipe box and make this again!","I had everything to make this and it was patiently waiting in my Recipe Box. Yes, this is so easy! I followed the recipe exactly and it is truly wonderful! The only thing I'll do different is to marinate the salmon with the butter, mustard, honey mixture. Thank you Chris for a new favorite! UPDATE DEC 2011: Marinate was very tender but I really didn't notice much of a flavor change - so I'll save time by not marinating as the recipe is originally written.","It's been a while since I've been amazed by a recipe, but I was truly impressed by this one! I did not change a thing. The cooking time is perfect - no over cooked fish here. I crumbled a slice of whole wheat for the fresh bread crumbs. I served the fish on a bed of baby spinach sauteed with evoo, garlic, fresh black pepper, and really good quality coarse sea salt. I also made the Basic Beurre Blanc (French white wine cream sauce), which tied in all the flavors perfectly. I thought this dish would be a culinary stretch for my hubby, but he finished a huge piece despite not being too hungry. I wish I could give this 10 stars for being so simple with ingredients and quick with the prep & cooking time. Fish, spinach, and sauce were on the table in 30 minutes.","Oh boy was this good! I used chopped walnuts and pistachios with the breadcrumbs, and mixed in dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh. I also substituted some sugar for the honey as I was out (and the sugar was to taste as I don't like too much sweetness). Served with mushy peas and a glass of Chardonnay, it was a terrific - and easy - meal. Will definitely make again.",Oh my God! This recipe is AWESOME!! I generally don't like salmon but this had an incredible taste - definitely a keeper! I used fresh breadcrumbs cut into roughly 0.5-1cm pieces which gave the salmon such an amazing mouth-watering texture. Can't wait to make it again!,"yum......i followed the recipe to a ""T""... the pecans was a nice addition to the salmon, didnt need any sauce for this like i normally need for fish.","The only thing I did differently about this recipe is I used 4tsp of agave nectar (WAY lower glycemic index than honey) instead of 5tsp, because so many people had warned about its being too sweet. It was a little bit sweet, but I thought the sharpness of the mustard balanced it well. Also I would highly recommend serving this dish with wild rice - the nutty, heavy flavor of the rice complemented the crisp, sweet topping so, so well.","Made it for Christmas, was a hit! it was literally gone within 10 minutes! I've made this 3 times already. I've found it works well on Tilapia too, but I prefer the original recipe with salmon.","This recipe was wonderful as written. I did not make any changes. When the salmon was ready to put in the oven, we had a slight delay and it sat out at room temp. for about 20 minutes with the topping on it. This helped to moisten the crumbs slightly and made for a nice crispy topping that did not fall off the fish. I will do that on purpose when I make this again.","Quite flavorful. I'm going to rate it 5 stars for flavor, but when I make it again, I think it needs minor changes to be considered out of this world. First of all, for 6 pieces of salmon, the mustard/honey mixture should be doubled to easily coat all of the fish. Don't mess with the proportions because the sweet/sour flavor was perfect. FYI, I used the course ground dijon which I think made it extra flavorful. Secondly, the breadcrumbs were a little overwhelming, so I would recommend decreasing maybe by half. In fact I had trouble sprinkling the pecan breadcrumb mixture because the breadcrumbs would clump together. I think it may be easier to coat in breadcrumbs first, and then sprinkle the parsley and nuts on top. I will definitely make this again...oh, and my 4yr old son even gobbled it up!","I didn't find that the coating added much to the salmon. I liked the addition of the dijon flavour but unfortunately, my husband doesn't like mustard and so that was what he liked the least. So, this recipe wasn't for us.","Hubby loved this! Personally, I thought it was a little heavy on the mustard, but the appearance of the dish was awesome, and I can decrease the mustard a tad the next time I make it. I used panko and omitted the salt and pepper. The mustard added enough salt for our palates.",i luved this...i made it this fall and forgot to review it...i used panko crumbs and followed the rest of the recipe as stated and will forsure make it AGAIN...thanks for sharing...,"This was EXCELLENT, thank you!!! The cook time was spot-on!","this is my favourite fish dish! i often make it with a white fish, such as halibut or snapper. instead of coarse bread crumbs (which my supermarket doesn't carry??), i'll use salad croutons! sometimes instead of pecans, i'll use pistachios! i discovered they're absolutely delicious in this recipe when i forgot to buy pecans, but had some pistachios on hand. the most important thing with the nuts is to always toast them!! this is a great base recipe to play with! its a keeper!!","Very, very good. Instead of honey, used maple syrup, and instead of pecans I used almonds, with fantastic results. Will certainly make again.",,,,,,,,
177,"We all really enjoyed these! My kother-in-law gave me a great tip to make this recipe easier: Put you cabbage head in the freezer, and freeze completely. When you take it out and it thaws, the leaves will be wilted and very easy to work with, eliminating the process of boiling the cabbage---one less step!","5 stars (if you follow other reviewers' advice). I am so glad I read the other reviews, because they turned out perfectly! I, too, steamed the entire head of cabbage first, added some garlic powder to the beef mixture (I used 1/8 tsp - perfect!), doubled the sauce (a must!), and baked at 350 (covered with foil) for an hour, instead of using the slow cooker. The only things I would change include using 3/4 tsp. pepper (1 1/4 tsp. was too spicy), and increase the onion to 1/2 cup for more flavor (which I did, and it was great!). I measured exactly 1/4 cup for each roll, and I ended up with 10 rolls. If you are pressed for time, you can substitute 1 Tbl. dried minced onion for the fresh onion. The second time I made this, I sprinkled some salt on the rolls before adding the sauce, and that helped give it more flavor. One more note: be SURE and use VERY lean beef - you don't cook the meat before rolling it into the cabbage leaves, so there will be no way to drain off the fat. Thanks for the recipe!","This recipe is really just okay, but could be tweaked to make it better. The sauce recipe needs to be quadrupled, because even a double batch leaves the rolls pretty dry. I would also add a little tomato sauce to the ground beef mixture, and a little garlic and maybe a little mustard powder. Also, you should know that the easiest way to prepare your cabbage is to core the head, and steam the entire thing. If you try to peel the unsteamed leaves, you are going to tear them.","my 5 star rating is for this recipe as written. I would give this 10 stars with my changes as it can be totally out of this world awesome with the alterations! I've been taught (by several Polish ancestors) to use half ground beef and half ground pork for tender, flavorful golumbki. I cooked the rice in water with 2 beef bouillion cubes added to it. (don't add extra salt to the meat mixture though.) To the meat, I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. The pepper may seem like a lot but makes this dish sing! (well, it made my family sing...) I tripled this recipe with great success. If you're going through the trouble of making golumbki, make enough to freeze another meal or for a family gathering. THANK YOU for asking us to boil the cabbage leaves rather than freeze them. (Tripling this took 2 heads of cabbage and made about 48 rolls.) It makes all the difference between tender edible cabbage leaves or rubbery ones to boil the cabbage leaves. My family has always taken rinsed, squeezed out sour kraut to lay over the prepared cabbage rolls. Pour the tomato sauce mixture over all this and top with (uncooked) bacon slices. No, this is not for the faint of heart fat free consumers, but for the people who want traditional cabbbage rolls (golumbki) that they and their kids will gobble up and ask for more! One more thing, this dish freezes well, so made in large quantities is nothing to fear.","THEY WERE AWESOME, I THINK THE BEST I EVER MADE. I FOLLOWED MOST OF THE REVIEWS, AND MADE MY OWN ADJUSTMENTS. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE ADDED 4 CLOVES OF GARLIC AND USED A COUPLE OF SHALLOTS INSTEAD OF THE ONION. THE SAUCE I MADE WAS 1 28 OZ CAN OF DICED TOMATOES AND 1 28 OZ CAN OF CRUSHED TOMATOES, WITH 3 TBSP OF BROWN SUGAR, 3 TBSP OF LEMON JUICE AND 1 TSP OF WORCESTERSHIRE. I COOKED SOME IN MY CROCK POT AND SOME IN THE OVEN. THE ONES FROM THE OVEN TURNED OUT THE BEST. THIS RECIPE IS A DEFINTE KEEPER.",These were great...just like I remember my Mom making. I did double the sauce and baked them in a 9x13 casserole dish for 1 hour at 350 deg instead of using the crockpot.,"This recipe is excellent, I looked at the reviews and other recipes and made a few alterations; my family loved them. I quadrupled the sauce recipe. And I used 1# of hamburger and 1# of spicey italian sausage. I ended up with 2 casseroles (one for the freezer). Also, I steamed one head of lettuce and it went to long and ended up a mushy mess. I found a video on the internet with a different technique for the cabbage leaves and I'll never do it another way. Get a very large pot of water and bring up to a small boil; as you're waiting for the water to boil core the cabbage head with a fairly wide margin at the top and take off the outer leaves that are dirty. Once the water is hot, place the cabbage head into the boiling water. After about a minute or so, the outside leaves will start to separate from the head; approx every 45 seconds a leaf or two will separate. As they separate remove them from the water into a pie tin or bowl. This is fail proof and the leaves are the perfect softness to roll with ease.","I doubled the sauce also, and it was super. The batch I made produced more than 12 rolls (I guess European cabbages are smaller?) but it was still delicious. Something I'll try next time is chopping the remainder of the cabbage and placing that in the bottom of the pan, rolls atop it, to allow for people who really love their cabbage. The juices make everything taste fabulous.","i was shocked! being of ukranian descent and having married into polish heritage, i'd had 'piggies' as many times as i've had haluski but had no idea they were so simple! started them yesterday AM before we cleaned our basement and by the time we needed a break they were done! my husband LOVED them (and that's saying something) and my 3 y.o wolfed his down, eating even the cabbage! this one has earned its place in my recipe basket!","No problems at all with recipe. Of course, I've made this type of recipe before and knew how to properly cut the cabbage leaves. You need to trim the ""spine"" of the thickest center part, in order for it to cook, and to bend, when you roll them up. They were so delicious!","Made these tonight from company and everyone like them. I quadrupled the sauce too and I baked them covered with foil for 1 1/2 hrs at 325, then uncovered for 30 min at 300. They turned out great!","Very easy reipe to adjust to be more authentic. One, absolute must is to sub at least half of the ground beef for ground pork. Two, if more liquid is needed, use beef stock rather than additional tomato sauce. Three, prepare double tomato sauce for extra to be served on the side or with leftover (if there is any). Four, prepare sour cream sauce (white sauce) for over the top when served: one part full fat sour cream, one part canned tomato sauce, one part sweet hungarian paprika. Thin slightly with beef stock if necessary, add salt and preferrably white pepper to taste. Sometimes I like to use smoked paprika in this sauce if I have it. This white sauce really makes the recipe for me, and it doesn't have to be heated, just mix and serve in a gravy boat. Also I don't use a crockpot (you want it dry enough after baking that it will hold its shape on its own-- then add more sauce on your plate) for this, I like to bake in a 350 degree oven in a 9x13 dish (as many rolls as will fit per dish, every head of cabbage is different, and since this recipe is so time-consuming I make alot when I make it) for 1 hour and a half. Oh yeah, one other thing is I agree to reduce the brown sugar just slightly in this version (and get plain tomato sauce, not the seasoned variety otherwise it ends up tasting like spaghetti sauce). Enjoy! I hope this helps.","My boyfriend loved this recipe. It was WAY to much pepper for my taste...I reduced the amount to 1/4 instead of 1 1/4. Also, I quadrupled the sauce. Very good.","If you're making Polish cabbage rolls (galumki), 80/20 ground beef, white rice, s & p, add some sauce to the meat/rice mixture before rolling up and bake covered for at least 1-1/2 hours at 350. The cabbage is cored and boiled (add a little cider vinegar to the water). The sauce I use is 2 cans each of tomato soup and stewed tomatoes (chop them up) and bring to a boil, pour over rolls before baking. The sauce is sweet, not savory. Very good ""piggies""! Leftover (small) cabbage leaves can be chopped up and fried in butter, then add cooked noodles, S&P (haluski or halupki).",This is my favorite childhood dish from my grandparents farm. Our version is more savory (no lemon juice or brown sugar) but with the layering of sauerkraut and crushed tomatoes (grown on the farm and canned of course). Cabbage shortcut - microwave the entire head for 2-4 minutes depending on size. Let it cool a couple of minutes so you can handle it. The leaves just peel right off. Quick and easy.,"MMM comfort food! I grew up in an Eastern European family and we had plenty of cabbage rolls over the years. My mom used to boil them in canned tomato soup and they were always bland and boring. Here is my variation on this recipe which is a great one, just needs a couple of additions. Use the slow cooker..boiling in a pot makes mushy rolls and baking them is good but you have to baste with sauce often..time consuming! I cut the core from my head of cabbage and boiled it for about 8 minutes. Put it in core side down first, then halfway thru cooking flip it over using a big spoon. That way when you dump it into the strainer it'll fall with the core side down and the water will drain out the bottom thru the core. I used half ground round and half ground pork, a cup of uncooked white jasmine rice, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 small onion, 1 egg, salt, pepper and lots of chopped fresh dill. Dill is the secret! I also used 1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 1 15 oz. can diced tomatoes and added the other ingredients listed (lemon, brown sugar, salt and pepper) and again, more chopped dill. Place half the sauce in the bottom of the slow cooker. When your cabbage is cool enough to work with peel the leaves off one at a time and put an oval meatball at the stem end. Fold the sides over and then roll the meatball burrito style. No need for string or toothpicks to secure, just put them in cooker seam side down. Cover with remainder of sauce and cook on High for 5 hours making sure ro","We loved this dish- with some modification. I followed recommendations made by others and doubled the sauce, and added a little water. I upped the seasonings quite a lot, and used 1/2 fresh polish sausage (homemade) and 1/2 lean ground beef. I think this recipe would have been quite bland without those additional seasonings and changes. Will make again. Here's a tip by the way- don't bother to boil the cabbage. Just put the cored cabbage in a pie plate, loosely cover it with plastic wrap and microwave it for 5-6 minutes. It steams perfectly and cuts way down on time and hot boiling water. The leaves just peel right off. If the inner leaves are still too stiff, stick it back in the microwave for an additional 2 minutes or so. Super easy.","For easy whole cabbage leaves..cut the root end off the head, then plunge the whole head of cabbage in a pot of boiling water. As the leaves soften- lift the head with a long handled fork and peel the individule leaves of one by one.","Perfect for the pressure cooker, I used this recipe in my pressure cooker, made the rolls and covered with sauce and 1 cup of water for extra liquid and pressure cooked over med heat for 15 mins. Tender perfectly done and easy. Loved it.","I quadrupled the recipe and got 42 cabbage rolls. I used 4 lbs ground beef, 4 cups cooked brown rice, 2 large onions grated, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 4 tsps pepper, 4 tbsps minced garlic and 4 tbsps Worcestershire sauce for meat mixture. For the sauce I used tomato sauce, tomato paste, ketchup, V8 juice, brown sugar, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Needed 2 heads cabbage.","This is a good, reliable reference recipe, one you can put your own spin on and still feel confident about its basic structure. That said, I added fresh garlic and parsley, and cooked the rice in beef broth. I used a multi-purpose steak type seasoning in lieu of just salt and pepper. As for the sauce, I skipped the sugar and lemon juice and used my own tomato sauce put up from my garden, about three cups worth – plenty to spoon over the cabbage rolls as well as for the garlic horseradish mashed potatoes I served them with. Rather than the slow cooker, I baked them in the oven, about an hour and 15 minutes, covered, at 350 degrees. I had extra meat mixture which I just rolled into Porcupine Meatballs and baked alongside the cabbage rolls. This was nothing fancy, just plain good old–fashioned comfort food, but do add some seasoning.","It was a good recipe to start with as a base, But I always tweak to my families tastes. I added a little more brown sugar to the sauce to cut the acidity and make it sweeter it because that is how I have always had it.I used brown rice and ground turkey and I also added a little extra tomato sauce to cover multiple dishes and I froze a couple of pans for later. They turned out really well.","A GREAT recipe for bachelors who drink while cooking. This Polish / Ukrainian dish went well with a bottle of Riesling (didn’t the Germans conquer Eastern Europe?). I, also conquered, was very, very liberal with all ingredients. I quadrupled sauce, added diced tomatoes, added chopped carrots and bell pepper. Lebanese friends suggested allspice, too. What the heck, it’s almost Ramadan. Cabbage head was boiled 8 minutes, cored side down first 4 minutes, cored side up for the last 4, as per advice from another cook's comments, so as not to scald myself when dumping in strainer for draining. Good idea. But I should have boiled about 5 minutes longer. I also baked at 350 for 1 hour rather than slow cook. I didn’t eat until the next day, so it was really tasty, like everything that spends the night in the fridge. Men, you can't screw this up unless you drink an entire bottle of Riesling and add way too much pepper, salt, lemon juice or Worcester sauce. So take it easy. Or you can screw it up if your woman cooked it and you offer up no compliments or refuse to eat it ""cause it aint meat ‘n taters"". Again, take it easy. Don’t be a total pig. PS: my kids balked (nay, gagged) at the very description. And it looked even worse. But tasted GREAT! My advice: consider this an NC17 rated dinner. But by all means, use this recipe as a skeleton and then go wild and crazy with your spices, sauces, wine and intuition. Note: the total pig side of me is objecting to my last sentence","I made this into a casserole. I steamed the chopped cabbage. I then put half of it into a casserole dish, topped it with the meat mixture, added the remaining cabbage. I topped it all off with double the amount of sauce mixed with 1/2 cup water. I baked it until it was all tender. Turned out great.","These rolls were great...I doubled the batch, and should have added just a touch more sugar, but it was easy to add it right before serving. I can say that Ive made cabbage rolls before and the only thing that was a little 'off' in this recipie was that the cabbage itself was too soft for my liking. I think the next time I make these, I shall bake them. Good flavor...the whole fam. liked them.","This recipe was excellent!! I did listen to other people's reviews and doubled the sauce recipe (and really I found that, that was the perfect amount). I added some garlic cloves on top and threw the ""scrap"" pieces of cabbage on top (just to add even more moisture), and the cabbage rolls were absolutely perfect. The worst thing you can do to a cabbage roll is make it dry and tasteless. These cabbage rolls were full of sooo much flavour and moisture, I would have to say I have honestly never had any as good as this. Even my husband was impressed (and that takes a lot! lol) 5 stars all the way! I will definitely be making this again!","When making cabbage rolls mix all ingredients together in a large bowl, cover and put in fridge overnight to let all flavors mingle. Instead of steaming or boiling cabbage a much easier way is to put cabbage in your freezer for two or three days thaw and use.","This is a wonderful recipe! As someone suggested earlier, I added a package of onion soup mix to the hamburger. It was wonderful! Also (thanks to my grandmother), the cabbage leaves came off a lot easier once I steamed the head of cabbage in boiling water. They peeled right off! There was no need to boil them again afterwards.","I've made this several times, and it's always a hit. I double the sauce portion, as we like a lot of tomato sauce with our cabbage rolls. The recipe is easy, and I freeze the cabbage the day before, as the leaves will be wilted when thawed- no reason to have to boil the cabbage to soften the leaves. Thanks for a great recipe!",Although these were good they were way too sweet for my taste. I grew up eating more traditional cabbage rolls that were cooked in tomato juice but like to try different versions. I would make these again but not use so much brown sugar,"i'm sure this is ok as far as cabbage rolls are concerned. i did use the advice of using a28 oz can of diced tomatos and 28 oz can of tomato sauce for the rolls. it was too much sauce as far as i was concerned. Doubling or at the most tripling the sauce recipe is plenty. Do add 1/8 t garlic powder. these are bland enough, i cant imagine them without the garlic. and the cabbage - i would recommend steaming the entire head of cabbage for your leaves. made them much easier to handle. i just cant get past the texture of cooked cabbage, a bit slimey for my taste. I even chopped the extra cabbage for the bottom of the pan to lay the rolls on. I dont quite know how people got so many rolls out of this recipe unless you make them meatball sized. wow that would have been even MORE cabbage per roll Not for me. i made 6 serving sized rolls with this recipe. they were a bit better the next day. basically these are porcupine meatballs wrapped in cooked cabbage leaves smothered in tomato sauce. ok but nothing spectacular. they are what they are. just not my thing i guess.","These are great cabbage rolls. I made twice-the 2nd time making because I wanted to use the base meat/sauce in Stuffed Bell Peppers too but give them that extra kick that was a little creamier! (Use Red, Green & Yellow peppers if you decide to do that) Use fresh minced garlic or garlic powder in your sauce. Double, even triple your sauce and freeze leftover to use later for cabbage rolls or stuffed peppers! Use Swanson' only low sodium chicken broth to cook your rice for more flavor (store brand broths & soups have too much soidum-check the labels). Reduce the pepper to 1 teaspoon. Buy a microwave steamer like Tupperware! You can cut the spine out of the cabbage, sprinkle with some salt and steam in 5 minutes if you don't want to use freezer method (which is a great way) as an easy alternative if you're ready to cook right away! You can omit the egg if you want, it will still bind. For a variation you can also omit the milk and stir in a bit of cream cheese or sour cream and as it melts, it binds the mixture. I used Campbell's tomato soup instead of tomato sauce as a variation. All this adds for more calories but the end result in flavor is delicious. As a certified chef that teaches creative cooking for the homemaker it's fun to see how you can make a fantastic recipe even better using your imagination & different ingredients. Make a double batch of cabbage rolls and freeze 2nd batch since you are going to the trouble.",,,,
178,"This recipe is a keeper. We loved it! However, I did mine in the oven. I like to serve flank steak with a sauce and if you pour the marinade over the steak before roasting you are left with an awesome gravy that is great over potatoes too! Also, marinating overnight is great, but you should try this even if you only have an hour to marinate.","Fajita meat was my target. My alterations to the recipe were; using balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, using a grainy-type mustard (I used Beaver Deli Mustard) in place of dijon and then low sodium soy sauce. Everything went into a ziploc bag, then into the refrigerator for 8 hours. The flavor of the thinly sliced steak FAR exceeded my expectation. The feedback I got from my family was, ""Mmm mm MMMM"" and ""mmM mMmmm MMmmMM!"". I think that means its a keeper, thanks Connie for a fantastic addition to my recipe collection.","This marinade recipe is the only one we will ever use when making grilled flank steak for fajitas! I did make a couple of additions. Since we were using it for fajitas I added 1/2 T. ground Coriander and 1/2 T. ground Cumin. For the vinigar I used Balsamic. We left the steak in a zip lock for 2 days and when my husband sliced it, it could have been cut with a fork! I'm embarrassed to even mention how much we ate! Thank You Connie!","Outstanding...ignore everyones ""I did this and I did that...blah..blah...blah"". If they are so talented...why dont they post it as an original instead of riding someone elses idea? This is great as recipe in its original form.","I cooked this in my broiler for 8 mins. on each side, basting occasionally with marinade. It was medium rare and quite good. Nice way to tenderize a tougher piece of meat.","This was my second time making this recipe for steak fajitas. This time, I added 1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin and corriander, along with a small handful of cilantro leaves, then substituted fresh lime juice and added a little lime zest. This time there were no complaints of bland steak, and the fajitas were a big hit!","This was a great way to make fajitas, I never thought to bbq a flank steak before. I marinated the meat for 48 hours (and added some slices of sweet onion, red and yellow pepper to the marinade an hour before I was ready to grill). We put the vegetables in tin foil and cooked them on the bbq as well (they took longer than the steak which we cooked to medium) We sliced the meat into thin strips with an electric knife and served with the vegetables, tortillas, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. They were awesome!!!","WOW! Because of the rave ratings, I grilled last night in 40 degree, rainy, windy weather. It was well worth it! The only change I made was I substituted balsmaic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe! This will be one of the 'regulars' on my grill this summer.","Well worth the 5 star rating. After reading through the many reviews, I divided the flank steak equally and marinated overnight. One flank steak was marinated exactly as the receipe recommends. The second flank steak was marinated using a good quality balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar and adding a 1/4 tsp of hot pepper flakes. Barbequed them side by side and it smelled so delicious a few neighbors wandered into the backyard and stayed to have dinner. While the red wine vinegar marinade was good, the balsamic vinegar marinade was voted far superior. Served fajita style with roasted red peppers and yellow onions, avocado's, sour cream, warm tortillas and Mexican rice from Allrecipes. Mix up a batch of margaritas and you have the makings of a fiesta!","THIS IS AWESOME! I have been on a mission for years to find a good home-created fajita marinade. I love Chili's fajitas, and these are just as good! I did add about a tbs. of sugar to the marinade since I prefer a tinge of sweetness, but you MUST try this. Be sure to marinade for the FULL TIME given in recipe. Otherwise, the taste may not come out right. Good as leftovers the next day too!","Recipe delivered all that it said it would. I marinated for 24 hours and for flank steak it was moist and not tough at all. Since we are not big eaters, I did not cook half of the steak. Instead I put it into a crockpot, the next day, along with mexican spices and cooked for 6 hours on low. We had wonderful, shredded fajitas! Thanks for sharing!",I followed this recipe exactly except added 1/2 t. dried basil and scored the steak both ways on the diagonal. Let it stand over night and cooked it on the grill--DELICIOUS. A dead ringer for my Mom's recipe! Worth every star.,"This is a great recipe. It is because it is from Weber Grill. This poster did not ""invent"" this recipe. Unless you mean copying and posting it as inventing.",I would give this more stars if I could!! The only change we make is using olive oil instead of vegetable and balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine. I have even used this with chicken. I've also cooked a roast in the slow cooker with this. I am addicted to it!,"I thought this marinade was wonderful! I used balsamic vinegar simply because I like the tangy taste of it, and added crushed red pepper flakes for some heat. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed. I marinaded the steak for 24 hours. Grilled about 8 minutes each side. I let the meat rest on the counter for 15 minutes before thinly slicing. While the meat was resting, I put the marinade on the stove and slow boiled it for about 5 minutes. Once the meat was sliced, I poured the marinade over the top. I served the flank steak on a toasted hoagie bun with a mound of sauteed onions, and a garden salad on the side. Absolutely delish! Thank you for a great recipe.",This was a great marinade for flank steak! Probably the best I've tried yet. I would suggest that you let the meat reach room temperature before grilling rather than cooking it straight out of the refrigerator as the recipe suggests. It makes for a more tender steak.,"Great base for your own marinade creation. We like to use flank steak for fajitas and so I needed to alter this recipe a bit. My alterations include 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup basalmic vinegar, 1/8 cup soy sauce, extra garlic. Otherwise the soy sauce is overwhelming and the marinade tastes asian. Whole family loves it with this changes and this is my go to marinade for flank steak on the grill.","we use this every time, with a 2lb flank steak. it turns out consistently good.",I've made this a few times and every time people have loved it. I think I have passed along the printed recipe 3-4 times now. The only thing I have done different is marinated at least 24 hours and in one case it was 48 hours. So amazing after that.,"I used this recipe the first time with balsamic vinegar bc I didn't have any red wine vinegar. It was AWESOME! The next time, I used red wine vinegar and we didn't like it as much. So the 50 times I've made it, I use balsamic bc it gives it a better flavor. Also, I slice the steak up first and put it in a big ziploc bag to marinate. Then I lay the slices out on the counter top George Foreman grill I have and cook them that way. Pair them with sauteed onion & bell pepper, sour cream and cheese and you have PERFECT fajitas! The kid loves them and so does the picky, chef hubby.",This is a version of a recipe I have used for several years. Try adding some rosemary to the marinade. It is always a winner! Great for tough cuts of meat. Also works great with top sirloin. Here's a tip - don't overcook the meat. It tastes wonderful cooked medium rare or medium and serve with some horseradish sauce - YUM! I'm getting hungry.,"After having this (yet again!) tonight, updating my March review: We grill this every week or so and it's truly addicting! Unfortunately, this week's heat wave made grilling uncomfortable, so after marinating, it was thrown in the freezer. Thawed & grilled it today and was even MORE tender and flavorful!! ************** I'd attempted flank steak only once before & it was a disaster - as it was a ""two-for"", we tried THIS recipe on the second steak. OUTSTANDING! Going into our regular rotation. Thanks!",Marinated for 6 hours. I did this recipe exactly. Steak had a strong taste to it but couldn't finger the problem. I will stick to my own recipe next time.,Mmmmmm this got two thumbs up from everyone at the table! A definite keeper! My only stray from the recipe was balsamic vinegar instead of red wine bc it was all I had in. Sooo tasty- thanks =),"This is a great recipe that I make at least twice a month. My family loves it! Due to personal preferences my minor changes include: cutting vegetable oil to 1/3 cup, balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, lime juice instead of lemon, added 1 tsp ground cumin, and some fresh cilantro. Our dinner time is certainly improved by adding this recipe to our rotation!","This recipe was so easy and tasted FANTASTIC. I always love to marinade meat in Italian dressing but this takes the cake. Luckily we ate it all because if there was any left, I would have kept eating it. Way to go on this easy, great tasting recipe. I wouldn't change a thing.","I have to admit I was a little unsure about all of the salt and acid in this marinade, but I tried it . I'm a believer now! This is the best marinade ever! My search is over. I'll be making this one only from now on!","I pierced the meat on both sides with a fork before pouring on the marinade. I marinated the steak for 24 hours and did turn the meat a few times. I wasn't sure if this flank steak would be too chewy but it was great. To serve it, my husband cut it on the diagonal in very thin slices. This would be great with a sauteed mushroom recipe on this site (Pat's mushroom saute) too.","DEEEEELICIOUS!! Ive never made flank steak, and this is the BOMB. My kids are raving right now. Made fajitas with this, put the veggies in a foil packet, grilled the steak. This is going into the family meal, and entertaining meal rotation for sure! I used limes instead of lemons cuz thats what I had and it was superb. Thanks for a fab recipe!!",followed the directions perfectly and this was awesome!!! We are using the remainder for fajitas and even though I am full I can't wait for dinner tomorrow night!!!!,"This recipe definitely imparts a TON of flavor that stays with the beef and does a fabulous job of tenderizing. I used balsamic vinegar as many other reviewers because it was what i had on hand and marinated for 24 hours which I think is very important if you have the time. With a few personal tweaks for my family's taste, definitely a keeper!",,,,,
179,This is an excellent supper for week nights. The only modification I made was to use fresh spinach versus frozen and added it to my colander prior to draining my pasta so that it cooked it slightly. This is a keeper.,"In response to the previous poster who asked how the sausage should be prepared: my recommendation is to remove the casing- especially if you're serving it to kids. If you don't remove the casing, it could roll back while cooking the sausage pieces and you'll get the inevitable question from your kids, ""What's this?"" then ""What's it made out of?"" then ""Ewww!"" Best bet: use frozen sausages, thaw very lightly in the microwave, then use a sharp knife to cut membrane and remove.","This is my family's new favorite recipe! They request it all the time! I make it a little healthier using whole wheat pasta, low-sodium chicken broth, and spicy Italian turkey sausage. We actually like the turkey sausage better than regular sausage.","Absolutely wonderful recipe, quite elegant, extremely easy (I'm a novice) -- and restaurant quality taste! I used mild bulk sausage (did not add oil) and penne pasta. Not draining the sausage made me nervous, but the end result was light and extremely good. Even my teenage boys loved it, spinach and all! All I can say is, thank you for submitting this one. It is a keeper!",4 stars with the changes I made. I added red wine (1/2-1 cup and reduced it longer) then added heavy whipping cream until thick and creamy. I threw in canned asparagus tips and fresh spinach. Great meal!!,"Wow, this was VERY good! I used a pint of fresh tomatoes versus canned and I used fresh spinach versus frozen. I think this did make a big difference in the over all taste but this recipe still gets 5 stars all the way. I also tried this with and without Parm Cheese and I can't believe as a major cheese lover that I am even typing this (putting hand over mouth) but I felt it was better with out the parmesan.","This is a great light pasta. With thin sauces like this, there are two things you can do to ensure the sauce still sticks to the pasta. First, fusilli is probably best to use with this (corkscrew shaped pasta). Second, don't cook your pasta first and then start on the sausage/veggie mixture. Do a little backwards planning, and after draining the water, don't waste any time with the pasta and get it mixed in with the sausage mixture. The pasta will be covered in starchy goodness that will help the sauce stick. I served this with some Focaccia bread that I also got from this site. Also, I suggest using fresh basil towards the end after the spinach is added. Dried basil simply doesn't do the fresh herb justice.",Unfortunately we weren't too impressed with this recipe. The sauce didn't reduce that much so the whole dish was soupy. All the flavors were great but we needed a bowl to eat it. Next time I won't add the juice from the tomatoes and cut back a bit on the broth.,"We found it 'salt-less' and that it needed some salt. 1/2 tsp should be fine. All I can say is know your sausage and make sure it's hot, or this dish will lack the zippy flavour that it could have.","I just made this recipe. It's still simmering on the stove as I ""speak"". The official verdict is that this is VERY good. I layered my flavorings by using fresh and dried herbs as well as seasoning salt and paprika. I also added a splash of red wine. The end result is a very tasty dish.","I really liked this and to be honest not many recipes are keepers for me, somehow people always give them a 5 and i feel like i did something wrong, but this is a 5! I used sweet Italian sausage and took them out of the casing and did as the other reviewer suggested and used fresh spinach and just drained my pasta over it to cook it! Great tip! My family liked it so much I will be making it again this week since I have an extra bag of fresh spinach!!","Really easy to make, and very good. I used a whole bag of fresh spinach, instead of frozen. Also. I used mild italian sausage, then I add crushed red pepper to spice it up to my heat tolerance","I didn't add the liquid from the tomatoes and instead added some heavy cream and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. With these changes, the recipe is AMAZING!!!","I have an almost identical recipe that I've been using for a few months now. My family loves it! My recipe calls for angel hair pasta, shrimp, in place of sausage, and cherry tomatoes cut in half instead of canned. My personal additions are sliced mushrooms, preferably fresh, and asparagus cut in 1"" lengths. Broccoli would also be a good addition. This is a very light dish perfect for hot summer nights.","Even my 9 year old and his 8 year old friend loved it. My son said ""this was the best supper ever."" I will definitely make this again.","I used turkey sausage, added zucchini, and replaced the parmesan cheese with asiago, along with doubling the basil and adding a sprinkling of oregano. Cooking the penne a couple minutes less then al dente allowed me to cook it in the sauce longer, which in turn made the pasta soak up more juices preventing this from being runny. Fold in fresh spinach at the end and this was a really fast weeknight meal. Different vegetable variations will keep this fresh, making this a perfect recipe to keep in rotation.","I use this versatile and tasty recipe in many variations; the sausage casings can be removed before frying, the sausages can be cut into pieces after cooking, or they can be left whole and removed when cooked and served on the side. If you want more non-meat content add some sundried tomatoes, asparagus tips, and or black olives. Works also very well with chorizo sausage, jalapeno peppers and/or feta cheese instead of the parmesan.","This was great!! Made a few adjustments, used an entire box of linguine, and a lb and a half of the italian hot sausage, and an entire bag of fresh spinach cut up. Cut off sausage casings, and then cooked whole for ten minutes, then cut into round pieces, added the parsley, but also crushed red peppers, freshly grounded pepper, oregeno, and chili powder. Added spinach the same time as tomatoes (used canned diced tomatoes with chilis)and onions( i used a red onion, as its a bit sweeter), added a bit of hot sauce to that mixture. Covered and cooked for an additional ten minutes, to get rid of the extra liquid. It was awesome. Next time I will use a larger can of tomatoes, because of the extra pasta and sausage, and maybe even some zucchini or summer squash slices.",This is DELICIOUS!!! Adding 1/2 tsp. of salt improved it for our family as well as using fresh spinach and tomatoes versus frozen/canned. It looks very elegant and can be served to guests as well as a week-night family supper. Very easy for the outcome!,"Love, love LOVE this recipe! I've made it with both fresh and frozen spinach. I prefer the fresh. I do put the spinach in the colander and drain the pasta over it and then just add all to my skillet. This is an easy dish and my kids love it! It's also my go to dish for taking suppers to people. It's different, but so delicious!","I made it according to the recipe. I didn't add anything, no salt, no pepper, nothing. Delicious. Easy to make and it has full delicious flavor. Common try it, you'll like it. I promise.","This recipe was excellent.It didn't say not to drain the sausage so, I didn't and I think that was a good idea, the sauce had a nice richness of flavor. I think letting all the ingredients simmer for at least 15 to 20 minutes is a good idea also, let the flavors come together. I did not use the full 14.5 ounces of broth as I felt it was too much liquid. I left a few ounces out. Also, I ended up using a tablespoon of corn starch as the sauce was just too thin for my taste. My sweetie and I ate most of it in one sitting. Simply delicious.","my daughter shared this recipe awhile back,It is now one of my favorite meals. It is cheap,easy and fun to make and delicious. Serve it in a big bowl with some crusty italian bread to sop up the juices and enjoy!!","I was skeptical about the liquid and I didn't want to add the spinach as I thought the pan would oil over, but I am so glad I stuck to the recipe! It was great! I used turkey sausage and wheat penne pasta. Yum and healthy!","Can I Give MORE Than 5 Stars?! This Recipe Smelled Good From The Start! I Definitely Cooked It A Little Longer Than Directed, Due To Girl Talk. But It May Have Made It Taste Better Doing It, Ha! This Recipe Blew My Mind & My Tastebuds! My Husband, 4 Year Old Picky-Eater Daughter Loved It So Much, They Pretty Much Licked The Bowls Clean. I Gave Some To My Neighbors To Try And She Thought It Was So Awesome, She Demanded The Recipe That Night. I Am Sad To Say There Were No Left Overs, So I'm Putting It On My Shopping List For This Week! =) Cheap Ingredients, Simple To Make, Perfect Outcome! Def A Keeper Recipe!","Thank you Tammy, This was Excellent. So easy and so wonderful. I followed the recipe but made a few changes. I used fresh Spinach and added 4oz sliced Black Olives. Perfect meal with hot crusty Italian bread. I will definitely make this dish again.",Too soggy....,So good. Had to use ground beef but added red pepperflakes. Everything else the same. Very good. ty for this recipe.,"I loved this recipes for its flavor and how easy it was to make on a busy weeknight. The only thing I changed was to use whole wheat penne, sweet italian turkey sausages and no cheese. Trying to eat a bit healthier. Thanks for the keeper!",Mike and I LOVED this!!! So flavorful. spicy any yummy. We ate a second serving just because it tasted good!,"This was EXCELLENT!!! I used 3 cups of uncooked penne and it was perfect. I took the casing off of the sausage. I also used a fresh bag of spinach and chopped it up and added it to the tomato & sausage mixture at the very end, just enough to wilt it. I will definitely make this again. The entire family gave it five stars.",Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.,Great sausage casserole! The spinach adds a lot of flavour as well as the garlic..plan to make it a staple in my home!,This pasta is great! My husband loves it! We double the recipe and eat it for several days. I also add fresh tomatoes and asparagus if I have it on hand.,"This was awesome! I did make some changes. I deglazed the pan with 1/2 c. cooking sherry and then added the onion, garlic and 1 sweet red pepper. Sauteed them for about 5 min. then added chicken boullion, water and tomatoes. I subbed the spinach for collard greens. This is definitely a keeper.",
180,"This recipe is AWESOME!! I made it exactly as written, which I always try to do on the first go-round because that's only fair to the submitter. That way, I'm reviewing THE RECIPE and not my new version of it. Ticks me off when some reviewers completely change the recipe and then take off stars cause they didn't like it. OK, I'll get off my soapbox now!! DH RAVED about the shrimp!! And you're gonna think I'm crazy, but try this as a side dish: reserve some of the marinade (I saved about 1/2 cup) cut a head of romaine lengthwise, leaving the core on to hold the leaves together, and allowing 1/4 head per person, drizzle the reserved marinade over it and let it sit. When the shrimp are done, cover them with foil and then throw the romaine ON THE GRILL! Cook it, turning several times, until the leaves are wilted and browning a bit. Then, either serve as a whole quarter or chop to make a bed for the shrimp! Better than pasta, cause it's a nice, crisp complement to the juicy shrimp! Thank you, Robbie, for an excellent dinner last night!","this is like the best of all grilled shrimp recipes rolled into one! I only gave it 4 stars cuz i did change a couple things-i added the zest of the lemon (to up the freshness meter even more), and used 1/2 fresh basil 1/2 fresh parsley (mainly cuz i have a garden being overrun by both). I also added some red pepper flakes. Oh, and I find that i enjoy this recipe more when i use ketchup instead of tomato paste,as i like the sweetness it gives. This was all for personal taste, however i would strongly recommend adding the lemon zest to this ( and really almost any recipe that calls for lemon juice.). BIG difference!!",Don't forget to soak wooden skewers for at least 30 mins in water before to prevent burning!!,My family loved this one. I added a little more garlic and used my George Forman (worked perfectly). I added pineaplle between the shrimp on the skwers. I threaded the bottom part of the shrimp then put a peice of the pineaplle and then the top of the shrimp went on over it....so good. And I placed the lemon slices on top of the skwers while I was grilling them. Served with Pasta Roni's Garlic and Olive Oil pasta and was so so good. You should try it. Will absoulutely make this again!!!!!,"I made this for my father-in-law for his birthday barbque yesterday and all of our guests loved it! The main comment that people made about this grilled shrimp was ""Oh my God, this Shrimp is To Die For..."" My husband is usually a very fussy eater and even he liked it. Something easy to make for dinner and my husband likes it....I think hell just froze over.","Concerned for hubby's sensitive innards, I decreased the amounts of oregano and hot sauce just a little as I thought both would simply make the shrimp too ""hot,"" at least for him. Not to worry! The hot sauce was barely noticable, and didn't even have the slightest bite I was afraid wouldn't work for him. In fact, he gave this a two thumbs up, as do I. Because we had sub-zero temperatures, I made this on the indoor grill and they were just perfect! I know we will be enjoying this often.","Absolutely delicious!! I wouldn't change a thing. For those worried about wasting tomato paste, you can do what I do and freeze it in tablespoon amounts. Drop tablespoons full on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet and freeze for a few hours. After that, transfer them to a freezer bag. You can take out a tablespoon or two at time as needed to add to sauces or marinades. The dollops thaw in just a few minutes.","I am not a big shrimp fan but my husbadn is -- these were outstanding. But, i marinated for about 4 hours, cooked for only 3 minutes per side to not overdo, and did not baste as it flared up too ,uch. They didn't need basting -- they were great. Would be great on pasta, we ate on rice, and i think would be good on top of my casear salad as well. We will make them often!","Not only did my fiance want to propose to me all over again, he was ready to give me whatever I wanted after eating this shrimp! This was the best shrimp EVER!! We couldn't even focus our attention to the T-Bone steaks he had prepared! And we also normally have lemon to add to our shrimp on our plate, but not with this recipe. It didn't need anything else. We even brought some to our friends and they are all asking for the recipe as well! Can't wait to make it again!!! Two thumbs up!","This was rated ""the best shrimp we've ever eaten"" by my whole family.It taste similar to a shrimp served in a local mexican restaurant. It was slightly spicy hot but just loaded with flavor. I also did not baste while cooking since my grill flared up when doing this. It was so moist without basting, so why bother? We will fix this often.","Delicious! I used pre-cooked shrimp, substituted Ketchup for tomato paste, and still delicious! (prev review on 6/11/08). Since then I have made this recipe twice. But the 3rd time I was tired of skewing the shrimp so I put it all into an aluminum pan and cooked on the grill. This was great! It kept the shrimp moist and much more flavorful since it cooked in the marinade. I will do this from now on. (last update 8/5/08). Ok, I have to add more now that the temperature is colder outside. I put all the shrimp and marinate in an oven proof pan, bake at 425 for approx 30 minutes. It's still great!","Love this recipe. Easy and always good. I usually make enough of the marinade for both the shrimp and veggies. Served this with grilled veggies on skewers - zucchini, mushrooms, onion and red pepper. A quick easy week night dish. No need to marinate for 2 hours; 30 minutes works fine","I also substituted ketchup for tomato paste, but just a tip for those of you who don't want to open a can for such a small amount. I open up both ends of the tomato paste can, push the paste all the way out, wrap it in saran wrap and freeze it. When a recipe calls for it, I simply unwrap it from the freezer and slice off the amount needed. It works beautifully. I substituted lime for the lemon and it came out delicious. Grilled it on skewers and threw it on top of a caesar salad with some crusty bread. This is a keeper.",One of the best marinades I have made. We added this to angel hair pasta and some crusty garlic bread...and a caesar salad for a great meal. Thanks for the post.,"Best.Grilled.Shrimp.Ever. Super-easy and fast! 5 stars and more with my few li'l changes and it freaking ROCKED! I will never use another recipe for grilled shrimp, and this comes with Mr. Picky's blessing (that is, my Hubster). Only changes to ingredients: I had a 1/2 tsp of Herbs de Provance and threw it in marinade. I used garlic salt instead of plain salt. I used FRESH ground pepper. I used brand-named Poblano Mexican Hot Sauce (GREAT), and I took the tails off the shrimp, they were completely nude and cleaned. Also, I used KETCHUP instead of tomato paste...and I do NOT like or even respect ketchup, but I got brave and did it, and I think that the slight amount of sugar in there made it all happen right with the very light burnt crust. I marinated raw and fat, fat shrimp for 2 HOURS TOTAL. One hour would have worked too for smaller ones. No longer though. The lemon will ""cook"" the shrimp otherwise, and they were limp and sorrowful upon inspection and I was sad for them...and me...but with only 3 minutes per side on the medium-hot grill, revived to become tempting morsels of overeaten shame! There is no reason to baste! They were moist and delicious. We literally could have eaten another pound of shrimpies. I cannot say enough good about this recipe and thank Robbie Rice for letting me in on the secret to the Best Grilled Shrimp ever. I served with steamed broccoli for a lean and mean Atkins'diet dinner. But I will bet you'd love them with pasta or rice. Enjoy!","This was excellent! I marinated and then sauteed in pan. I also added a touch of cream at the end with a touch of salt and pepper to taste. Tossed it with noodles, it was so good my picky husband scarfed it all up!","LOVED IT!!!!! I have made this twice now. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. Everybody thought it was fabulous and asked that I make it again. The second time I upped the garlic, added some basil and a teaspoon of cayenne. Also, took another reviewers advice and added the zest of the whole lemon (great suggestion). WOW was it delish!!! This is one of the best marinades I've ever used, and I'll use it again and again :) Thank you so much for sharing Robbie Rice!",To die for!,This is excellent. I did put a dash of worcestershire and liquid smoke in it. Extra marinade is great for cooking vegetables in.,"This is my favourite shrimp recipe! 3 tips... use 2 skewers to thread each shrimp line, that way they don't escape your cooking process... make sure to soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes first... and 10 minutes cooking time is too much, more like 6, just baste each shrimp line with the reserved sauce and increase the heat at minute 2 each side for about 30 seconds. (Reduce the heat, flip, at then wait 2 minutes for the second side.) Get a wonderful char-crisp, melt in your mouth shrimp girl/guy each bite!","This is awesome. If I could give it more stars I would. I think this is the best shrimp marinade I've ever had. However, like some other people have posted, don't add the lemon juice until you're ready to put it on the grill, or your shrimp will be tough. I added a little lemon zest to the marinade, and then mixed in the juice to the reserve marinade for basting. So incredibly good! Everybody in the house raved about it, and we can't wait to try it on other types of seafood too.","I followed this recipe as is, minus the black pepper and I subbed ketchup for tomato paste as I didn't feel like opening a whole can for such a scant amount. These had a great flavor to them. I served them over whole wheat linguini w/sugar snap peas sauteed in EVOO and garlic. Nice quick easy tasty meal. TY!","Although I'd love to say I ""tweaked"" this recipe to personalize it, I didn't. Made it as directed, and all of us were absolutely delighted with the final results. Now I can imagine a few tweaks: skewering with fresh fruit(pineapple, peaches), sweet onions, even chicken thigh tidbits (same marinade? Maybe just a lemon/pepper marinade for the chicken for a refreshing taste?). I say - try the original recipe once then play with it the 2nd time. Enjoy!","OMG! I was in heaven last night when I eating this! This is the best shrimp I have had in a long time! I only made 1 pound of shrimp so I used half the marinade on the shrimp and the other half on some chicken tenderloins and BBQ'd those as well and they turned out delish also. I think the marinade would work well with any kind of meat. I did add the zest of the lemon and used ketchup instead of tomato paste as stated by other users. I think I would cut the salt and pepper in half the next time I make this, it was a bit on the salt side for me. Overall, a wonderful and aromatic recipe, a definate keeper! (Update: made this again and cut the salt in half and it was still too salty. Third time was a charm with no added salt.)","First things first; don't discard the marinade in the second step that you need for basting in the third! I tried it as posted, very good. Then made my own changes for a Mexican flare. Sub cilantro for fresh parsley (hint, always use the tube variey instead of fresh in marinades, it will incorporate much better). Sub chipolte Tobascco for ""hot pepper sauce,"" cumin for oregano, and lime for lemon (add the zest and juice).","My whole family loved this recipe, though I'll use less or no salt next time.","This recipe was awesome!! I made it exactly as listed and I could not believe the wonderful flavor! The only thing I did not do was baste it, we were at the start of hurricane Irene so I just put them on the grill and only had to get wet twice. This is definitely going into my favs, thanks for sharing!!","This was delicious! I have never enjoyed seafood, but this recipe has changed that..definitely a keeper!","Very delicious & juicy shrimp! This is by far, my favorite recipe to make on the fly, it is so easy to throw together. The olive oil and the tomato paste really make a good combination. We grill the shrimp on low heat to avoid the flames and overcooking the shrimp. THEY ARE SO GOOD!!","Just reading this and will try the recipe, since it sounds wonderful, but just wanted to add a really quick comment. For those of you who don't want to open a can of tomato paste for just a tablespoon, try freezing the rest. I take a measured tablespoon, put it into a ziplock snack bag, squeeze out the air and continue until I use up the can. It stays well for quite a while and you would be surprised what a tablespoon of tomato paste can do for many recipes.",No doubt the best shrimp marinade I've ever made. We use it for chicken as well and it's perfect. Everyone asks for it often. We like it spicy so add more hot sauce to kick it up a bit. Try it. You won't be sorry.,,,,,
181,"If there was a better rating than five stars I would certainly give it to this recipe. It was a total hit here and my mom told me that it was the best thing I'd ever cooked, & she wants me to make it often now. The only changes I made: I added an extra tablespoon of ground cashews, and also I added the curry at the beginning and cooked it with the onion to bring out more of the spicy taste (I was told this is how traditional Indian cooking is done). All in all this was a simply delicious meal and it tasted exactly like something I would expect to find in an Indian restaurant. The ingredients are simple yet the taste is extremely flavorful and just a tad sweet. The only negative thing I have to say is, the ten minutes the recipe gives you to cook the potatoes is simply ridiculous. I had to leave them for about half-an-hour and even then they were very firm (but not raw). Also, make sure you stir a lot because the stuff tends to stick a little to the bottom at first. Next time (I'm going to make this often!), I'll cook the potatoes a little before-hand, and I'll also add cauliflower.","I made this for dinner the other night for my husband and I, and it really was amazing. We couldn't stop raving about it, and the whole time it was cooking I kept hearing my husband say, ""Man, that smells good!"" Very easy to make and delicious. I used 1 15-oz can coconut milk (still kept the tomato sauce) instead of the heavy cream as many reviewers suggested. I also added about 1 1/2 cups cauliflower florets and that was a really nice addition. And instead of just curry powder I used 3 1/2 tsp curry powder, 2 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/4 tsp turmeric, 3/4 tsp ground cardamom, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg, and a dash of ground cloves. SO much better and more authentic than curry powder. The only problem I had with this recipe was that the potatoes took much longer than written to cook and become tender. I used Yukon Gold potatoes, which was recommended by one user, but that didn't seem to make a difference. Finally I decided to add the coconut milk earlier than written to see if more liquid would help the potatoes cook faster, and that is definitely what did it. Once I added that, the potatoes cooked up in no time and I was able to add the rest of the ingredients and finish the recipe. Served with rice and naan. We will DEFINITELY be making this again and again, as we really like to eat vegetarian at least once or twice a week and are always looking for new recipes to add to our collection. Thank you for a great recipe!","Delicious! I made this twice, and prefer to omit the tomato sauce and put in some yogurt instead. Tastes more like from the restaurant that way. I also play with the spices, adding a bit of cinnamon, turmeric, garam masala, and cardamom.","A great korma. Just as good as our favorite Indian restaurant makes, and not as heavy. I used only 1 large potatoe, and a whole can of light coconut milk rather than cream and tomato sauce. I also used a little less curry and added a teaspoon of garam masala. YumYum.","Good starting point. Like many others found it needed more seasoning. I added about 4 cardamon pods, 1 tsp cumin, upped the curry to 2tbs instead of the 1.5tbs, and added a few sprinkles of cinammon. Also, doubled the garlic amount. Didn't use the bell peppers, instead used cauliflower and added fish. So yummy but even better next day. Seriously as good as restaraunt if not better....",Excellent recipe! My husband and 22 month old loved it! I made a few modifications as well: coconut milk insead of cream and a few extras like spinach and garbanzo beans and it was a definite hit! Can't wait to try the left-overs....,"I've mad ethis many times. Try adding a little coconut milk it balances the spice a bit. Also DON'T use sweet potatoes, the consistency didn't work well nor the flavor. I like to add turmeric as well to give it a little more oomph. Definitely a keeper!","This was very good once I upped the amount of curry and added garam marsala and fresh ground pepper. At the end, I still felt like it was missing something, so I added a pinch of brown sugar and it was just the right touch to compliment the curry flavor! Will definitely make again.","This dish is absolutely delicious and satisfying! The recipe turned out wonderfully. I followed it pretty exactly, only, because I wanted something without dairy in it, I used coconut milk instead of the heavy cream, I used finely chopped almonds instead of cashews, and I used 1 less potato than called for, as the potato I had was pretty sizeable. I think adding another potato would have been way too much! Otherwise, a superb entree that tastes heavenly and exotic next to jasmine rice. Yum yum! If you try this with the heavy cream and like it, I suggest making it again sometime with the coconut milk. The flavor is distinct and rich.",Had to add more spices but it was delicious!,"Yum! I confess I read many of the reviews and altered the recipe some, but I stuck as close to it as I could. First, I doubled the recipe, except I kept the potatoes at 2, and added a medium-sized head of cauliflower (cut into bite-size pieces). My other changes: I cut the onions in half and thinly sliced each, then sauteed them in about 2 tbsp. olive oil for 40 minutes — to the point of caramelizing (I wanted the sweetness). Taking a cue from another reviewer (who recommended canned potatoes), I peeled the 2 potatoes and 8 carrots and cut them into bite-sized pieces, then steamed them until they were nearly done. Instead of the tomato sauce, I used 2 cans of no-sodium diced tomatoes (juice removed). I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, so I used cayenne pepper (worked just fine). I used a little over 4 tbsp. curry powder, plus 1 tsp. garam masala, 1 tbsp. tumeric, and 1 tsp. powdered cardamom. I also added cilantro while it was cooking rather than as a garnish. I also used 2 cans of light coconut milk plus 1 c. water. Other than sauteeing the onions and steaming the potatoes and carrots, I didn't pay much attention to the order I followed in adding ingredients... I more or less tossed it all together and then let it simmer for 45 minutes or so. I served it with brown rice, but I'd have preferred brown basmati rice... I'll save that for next time. Thanks for posting!","really, extremely delicious. easy to prepare. it took a little longer than expected (because maybe i used the wrong potatoes, and those took a while getting tender) and i didn't add any extra salt. really made the curry powder (home-made) come alive.","This was delicious! I used a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce instead of a 4 ounce can. I put in a whole can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream. I didn't put in any potatoes, instead I added some cubed tofu. I also didn't add the jalapeno. This was such a flavorful Indian dish that tasted pretty close to a really good Indian resturaunt. I served it with basmati rice and homemade naan. Putting in cashews was such a nice touch. Thanks for the great recipe!!!","Yakuta, you are phenomenal! I loved this recipe! We followed it with one substitution (diluted tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce) and it was delicious! I highly recommend this recipe, no alterations. We served it over ""Indian-Style Rice with Cashews, Raisins and Turmeric"" with Naan and ""Mango Lassi II."" Delicious!","Well I'm brown so my expectations may not have been realistic for this recipe. I made it as originally written with some spice modifications the first time and the favors were pretty bland for what I'd expect from a korma. Still the base recipe is a GREAT starting point if one adds liquid with the starch so the potatoes cook properly. The second time I more than doubled the spices (cumin, garam masala, turmeric powders), bay leaf, small cinnamon sticks, garlic, ginger and sautéed all to release flavor as first step even before the onions - I remember my grandma cooking this way. Skipped dairy and used tomatoes to create the curry - I guess this is North Indian flavoring. I referenced the chicken korma recipes for inspiration too. And then at the end I heated the cardamom pods in a dry sauce pan to release the flavor and added five or six pods to the korma. Next time ill try with fish when I having an ""animal protein day"", which I do once a week. Pretty much any hearty veggie can be added to this recipe for a yummy dish. Thanks!","Still not totally the same as our local Indian buffet, but certainly tasty. Maybe the type of curry powder makes a difference? I made a dairy free version by using coconut milk instead of the cream. Had to add liquid to get the potatoes cooked, and it took a lot longer than the recipe said (then again, more time for spices to mingle). Might try this again with different curry.","I am Bangladeshi and I cook mostly curries. To cut down on cooking time you can do the following:-use frozen vegetables, -microwave boil fresh vegetables while cooking the onions cook, -use canned vegetables(especially potatoes)","This was great! I had planned on using coconut milk instead of cream but had none in the cupboard at the crucial moment, so added some yoghurt & milk in desperation & it was still tasty. I added some garam masala, which is a must & a little turmeric & cardamon. My potatoes took a lot longer to cook through than stated.",Steamed the carrots and potatoes beforehand. Used 8 oz can tomato sauce. Subbed coconut milk for heavy cream. So good! Will make again and again!,"Mmm I liked this!! My Indian friends' mothers all mix curry in earlier in their recipes, so I added it with the onion to the skillet. I also replaced the heavy cream with coconut milk. Everyone enjoyed- thanks!! :)","Great recipe, added more spices (1tbsp garam masala, 2tsp cumin and extra curry powder for a double batch). Added a little water to help cook potatoes but it still took longer than the recipe called for.",meatless meals are a tough sell in our house. but this got sighs of satisfaction all around. basic recipe is sound and it can be tweaked (spice level and additional ingredients) with no worries. plain yogurt instead of heavy cream was just the ticket and cauliflower added rounded out dish. will make this for next party or potluck.,This was good. We used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. I thought it was better after we added some diced tomato. Thanks for the good base recipe!,LOVE this dish! you can make it less fat buy using coconut milk and make sure you dice the potatoes pretty small so they cook properly in the allotted time.,I made this dish minus the cashews and jalapeno. According to Madhur Jaffrey (very renowned Indian chef) Jalapenos should never be used in Indian cooking so I used canned green chili's and it was delicious. I omitted the cashews as a personal preference.,"Just finished eating this and all I can say is WOW! Easy to make and forgiving of a couple missing ingredients (jalapeño & cashews). I could eat this once a week. The spices are perfect. I had to sub in coconut milk as I had no cream in the house. I added the curry with the onions and the aroma was heavenly. I think this would also be great with some chicken added to it, but it is great without it. Make sure to finely dice the potatoes and they will be tender when everything else is ready. I served this over brown rice. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe. My husband is still raving about it.",Add coconut milk instead and more veggies,,,,,,,,,

183,"I'm giving this five stars for this recipe w/ modifications. I think you will really love this if you try it the way I did! I seasoned the chops w/ s,p, and garlic powder, then dredged in flour seasoned w/ pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and some Emrils all-purpose seasoning....& browned in olive oil. On the stove, I boiled the water w/ one large chicken bouillon cube, then reduced, and added one can of cream of mushroom soup. I wisked together about 4 T flour in some cold water and added it to this saice. I let this simmer a little. Poured over chops and onions in crock pot. Right before it is finished, or even after it is done, then add 8 oz. sour cream and stir around. This was tasty, creamy and great served over wide egg noodles and freshly steamed green beans sprinkled w/ lemon pepper. Hope this review helps someone. I think the blandness some complained of will be alliviated w/ the extra seasonings in the flour mixture and the cr. of mushroom soup!! Try it!","Being that I saw this recipe at the last minute, I couldn't use my slow cooker, so I just browned my chops in my cast iron skillet with the onions, removed the chops just long enough to make a roux, added two cups of chicken broth instead of the water and simmered for forty five minutes. After they were done I again removed them from the skillet and added the sour cream and cooked for a minute. They came out so tender and the sauce was excellent! Good one Ami!!","absolutly fabulous! Bear with my changes, but I thought they might help someone else! I used 5, two inch thick chops, seasoned with s,p,gp (salt, pepper, garlic powder), THEN I dreged them through highly seasoned flour (just use what you like). I browned them in garlic infused oil. I then browned the onions and put them on top of chops in crock pot. For the sauce, I used 2 cups cx. broth, seasoned with fresh garlic, paprika, s,p,gp, and few other random things, and 1 can cream of mushroom soup. Poured it over chops and cooked on LOW for 5 hours...could have just been 4 hours though. Last, I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and the sour cream after moving chops to oven. I think I should have used only 4 oz. sour cream though. It was perfectly thick and very rich! We loved it!",I hate when people make so many changes and then rate the recipe. I didn't change a thing. I made the recipe AS IS and it was a really great quick and easy meal. I served it with rice and my family loved it. Thank you for the recipe.,This was a HUGE hit with my family. I took heed of the reviews that claimed it was low on flavor and added a few changes. My first change was that I coated the pork chops in roasted garlic and red pepper spice mix and THEN dredeged them in flour and browned them. Then I cut the onions along with some quartered mushrooms and sliced a red pepper. I carmelized all of these in a pan with a little olive oil. YUM. Then I followed the directions exactly except for the end where I noticed the sauce wasn't as thick as I would like. I had no cream of mushroom soup so I threw in some cream cheese. It was thick and flavorful and delicious!,"Maybe I shouldn't give this 5 stars, since I changed it so much, but my kids and hubby loved this recipe. I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I did everything in a skillet on top of the stove. I used chicken broth rather than bouillon cubes, and I left out the flour. After simmering for a while, I took off the lid and the sauce thickened up nicely without flour (and since I'm on a low carb diet, it worked better for me). I browned one chopped onion and a can of mushrooms along with the unbreaded breakfast-style boneless chops in the skillet, drained away what little olive oil I used, then mixed the broth and sour cream along with the spices I usually use for pork chops. After simmering for about 25 minutes, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar just to deepen the flavors. There wasn't a drop of this sauce left, or a scrap of meat.","Delicious! The sauce was the best but I did make a few changes. I was crunched for time so just threw the chops, seasonings etc... in the slow cooker without drenching in flour or browning. Later when I made the sauce I just added a little more flour. Didn't really think that extra step was needed.","I have to give this a five star rating, b/c I messed it up and it still came out great! I didnt read the recipe through and started to prepare it at 5pm. Of course, when I got to the crock pot part, I knew I had to change it. I browned the chops as directed and cooked the onions until they were soft. I transfered chops to a glass casserole dish and put onions on each chop. Then I added the bullion/water mixture over all and baked for 30 minutes at 400. After I drained the juice and added to a small pot, stirring in the 2 tbsp of flour and cooking for 5 mins. I poured over chops and my husband thought it was delicious. (he hates sour cream as well but had no idea, like other reviewers families ;)","This recipe is definitely a keeper. My entire family loved the tenderness of the chops and the richness of the gravy. After I browned the chops, I poured the water/bullion cube mixture into the pan and stirred up the browned bits. Hate to waste that extra flavor! Yum","Slow cooked these with extra can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 # fresh mushroomss,using chicken stock rather than bouillon. Turned out great. I've been trying different chop recipes since my b/f told me he doesn't like them. Will make a believer of him yet! Hey, I lived in IOWA.... This is a start. Thanks.","WOW! My husband and I LOVED these pork chops! I usually go by the recipe exactly the first time I make it but I had to make a couple changes to this one to save time. I did not coat the pork chops in flour and fry them in oil before putting them in the slow cooker, I simply coated them with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder and put them straight in the slow cooker. I followed the rest of the directions and when they were done cooking I did not put them in the oven on 200, that will only dry them out. I put them in a dish with a bit of the juice from the crock pot. Then I took all the juice/onions from the crock pot and put it in a small saucepan and added the flour/sour cream and cooked on medium heat while stirring, this was MUCH quicker than waiting for it to thicken up in the crock pot! I also added some extra seasoning to the sauce. They were delicious! I will be making this recipe on a regular basis!",I used McCormic Garlic Pepper to season the chops and fried them lightly without using flour. I cooked them on high in the crock-pot for 4 hours.(They were tender at this point but not falling apart.) I put the pork chops on a plate and then dumped all the liquid from the crock- pot into a sauce pan. I added a packet of Mushroom gray mix and brought to a boil stirring continuously. After that I put the pork chops back in the crock-pot and poured the sauce over top and cooked on low for another 3 hours. MMMMMMMMMMM - Delicious! The pork chops fell apart and mixed with the gravy. I served it over mashed potatoes. My husband made an open-faced sandwhich. Perfect comfort food for a cold night!,"This recipe is great as written!! Most of the time I skip the whole browning process though. I season the chops or pork steaks with salt, pepper, garlic powder, emerils or seasoning salt. I layer the onions starting with onions on the bottom and between the layers of chops. I use chicken broth from a box and pour in without heating. I start it out on high for two or three hours and finish it on low about 5 hours. I remove the chops and keep warm in oven while I prepare the sauce. I strain the broth into a sauce pan then add the sour cream and flour or corn starch and heat and stir until thickened. Comes out beautiful without lumps. I then pour some of the sauce over the chops and save the rest for rice or noodles. I love serving this with rice, greens, blackeyed peas or beans and corn bread muffins. It is a great comfort food meal with a down home feel!! My whole family loves this!!","Easy! Kids liked, husband liked, I liked! I did need to add more flour to thicken the sauce but other than that I followed the recipe and won't change a thing next time either. Chops were so tender!!","Oh well, some people just want to hear themselves talk--this was a lovely recipe. Very similar to an old standard from my mom.","I have been making this recipe for years, it's delicious and worth a 5 star rating! I add a few spices to the sauce because it's a bit bland. I add ground black pepper and a little garlic powder to the sauce. Other than that I make it as written. It's easy and very yummy!",Very good the chops I browned them on top of the stove and removed the chops while I made the sauce. I added the chops to the sauce and baked them on 350 for an hour then turned down heat and let bake at 200 for another hour. they were wonderful fell apart they were so tender this is a keeper,"Yery Good! made it exactly as stated. I love it when people modify a recipe to THEIR liking, then give a 5 star rating! Go figure.","These were super tasty and moist. I followed the ingredient list, but I did have to alter the cooking method. I browned the chops on the stove in some olive oil with the onions. I removed the onions and chops after browning so I could make a rue with 2 tbsp flour and 2 tbsp butter. I then added the pork chops back in with the onions. I then added the chicken bouillon / water mixture. I cooked on the stovetop on medium low for 45 minutes. After finished cooking I removed the chops and added the sour cream to the sauce. Not a single drop of the sauce or chops were left. Very good recipe.","These chops came out absolutely amazing! It is now one of our favorite dishes. I also made a few changes based on the other reviews. I seasoned the pork chops with seasoning salt, dredged in flour and then browned them in a little olive oil and added fresh garlic. I moved them to the crock pot and threw in chopped onioins, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a combination of chicken and beef broth (2 cups total; didn't have enough of one to do all the same). I cooked it on high for 6 hrs and then added the light sour cream right in without removing the chops. I cooked them another 30 mins in the sauce and then served them over egg noodles. They were moist, flavorful and falling apart. My husband just raved about them!","This is a wonderful recipe! Good enough for a company dinner. I basically took some of the other suggestions and made them my own. One suggestion is to use boneless pork chops and then to cut all visible fat from them prior to cooking them. The chops become so tender that they do fall right off the bone. Then you are left with all these little bone fragments in the sauce along with the fat that has detached from the meat. Next time I will take care of that in advance by using boneless chops and cutting off fat first. I too seasoned chops. I used Santa Maria Style Seasoning which is just salt, pepper, garlic, and parsley. Then I dredged the chops in flour that I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and paprika. Lightly fried them on each side in a combo of olive oil/butter. Boiled my water and disolved the chicken cube and then added one can cream of mushroom soup to chicken broth. Heated and stirred until creamy. I sliced my onion and sauted it in the pan juices where I had fried the chops after I removed them to the crock pot. Then added the softened onions to the chicken/mushroom soup mixture and stirred until creamy. I then poured the chicken broth/mushroom soup/ onion mixture over the chops in the crock pot and cooked it on low for about 7 hours. They were probably done after about 5 hours. Served over rice. Delicious!","I didn't enjoy the sour cream flavor in this dish,but my bf does. I'll stick to the way I usually make it,with my pork chops breaded,baked,then add cream of mushroom soup and milk the pork chops,then baked again.It's very mouth- watering this way","Delicious! Had great flavor, but my chops completely fell apart cause they were so tender...so no complaining here!",Easy recipe for a mom on the go. Started this on my lunch break and was ready by the time I got home. The kids loved it. I thought the flavors were fine so long as you season your chops they way you like. We ate with california blend veggies and brown rice. (didn't have time for mashed potatoes).,"Great Recipe....I've never made more tender pork chops EVER! I loved using my slow cooker and have never used sour cream with pork chops, but our family loved it....including my 5yr old daughter. The second time I made this I seasoned the chops w/ plenty garlic powder, added 1/4 cup white wine and used only half the sour cream and we thought it was AMAZING! Thanks!","This was the advice I followed from another user! I'm giving this five stars for this recipe w/ modifications. I think you will really love this if you try it the way I did! I seasoned the chops w/ s,p, and garlic powder, then dredged in flour seasoned w/ pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and some Emrils all-purpose seasoning....& browned in olive oil. On the stove, I boiled the water w/ one large chicken bouillon cube, then reduced, and added one can of cream of mushroom soup. I wisked together about 4 T flour in some cold water and added it to the sauce. I added it all to the slow cooker with half an onion diced into small pieces. I also added a can of drained mushrooms. My family LOVED this one!!","My family was very pleased. I'm a novice ""cooker"" and this is the first time I successfully made pork chops in the slow cooker. They were very tender, fell apart with just a fork. My gravy was pretty runny, but very flavorful. The next time I make it, I think I'll just transfer the juices to the stovetop to make the gravy. I think that will help thicken it up more. Also, I combined all of the dry ingredients for dredging. I felt like it saved a step and also distributed the flavors. I added dried mustard as well. Thanks for the yummy recipe!",,,,,,,,,
184,"A savory dish without garlic?! Oh, the humanity! I set this precious dish on a bed of wild greens, avocado & seasonal tomatoes with a whisper of bleu cheese. An incomparable success! A glass of good red wine cleared the tongue, readying it for more, more, more! (added 05/12/07: Fry a sliced pear or two until golden brown after you fry the meat. Pour the prepared vinegarette over both!)","This is an excellent recipe for lamb. One of the few recipes here I've changed little to none. I see quite a few complaints on the reduction as being either too thin, or that there's too much left over. Make sure you give the sauce time to reduce(reductions are by no means quick), and know that the more surface area to your skillet, the less time it takes to reduce. Also, if you're trying to do this in a non stick pan, that might be the problem. Use good stainless steel as it is a great heat conductor, and also necessary to properly sear the lamb. I also see complaints about it tasting too ""vinegary"". If you reduce it properly and use high end balsamic vinegar, you should not have this problem. After all, there is no point to CHEAP balsamic vinegar, EVER.","This was my first time making lamb so I was more than a little nervous. I cannot believe how great this was! My husband kept making sounds after biting into it, ""Ooh, Ahhh,ummmm....."" I would give it ten stars if I could. The lamb was great served on a bed of wild greens and the reduction sauce was perfect drizzled over everything including my rosemary baked potato wedges. It paired well with Nero D'avola's ""Romolo Buccellato"" (a red wine). An unsung hero of a wine, well worth the $8 we paid for it. Next time I'll try shallots instead of onions and I'll look for a nice warm deep mellow balsamic. I'm exciting about making it again, maybe even making it for a dinner party!","This was AMAZING! Keep in mind that you should use a GOOD quality balsamic in this recipe. The stuff you buy for $3/bottle is fine for marinades or maybe dressings, but when using basamic as a foundation in a sauce, shoot for upper-end grocery store quality; or even better, swing by a gourmet shop for a high quality vinegar. A recipe is only as good as the ingredients you use!","Delicious! I followed this recipe very closely. I placed the rub on the chops a few hours before dinner. Excellent flavor and aroma. I doubled the sauce (& cooking time) and added just a pinch of flour to it near the end to thicken. Soooo tasty. One tip for other lamb neophytes... the lamb chops i bought were the size of lollipops. I didn't realize how small they were until I got home because the butcher wrapped them before I saw them. They were very tender and tasty, but you would've needed at least twice the number of chops to satisfy. So, check the size of the chops before you buy them and adjust accordingly. I will absolutely make this again!","I am attending culinary school and this meal was truly amazing and I have cooked alot of stuff! I did do a few changes after reading a few reviews. We are huge garlic fans in this house so I seared the lamb in fresh garlic. For the reduction, I reduced for about 17 minutes and added about 2 tbls of heavy whipping cream for some added flavor. I finished off with roasting red potatoes drizzled with olive oil, rosemary, fresh basil and thyme, crushed red pepper and pepper in the oven covered for 20 mins and uncovered for 20 at 405 degrees and green beans. This meal gets 10 stars! A sure favorite.","I love Lamb, And this is a great recipe. I changed the herbs to Herbes de Provence and this time it was even better.","BOY OH BOY! We had this last night. Super fantastic delicious recipe. We followed the recipe exactly with the exception of rubbing the chops with garlic (3 large cloves minced) then rubbed with the mixture. Then seared the chops in the skillet to get some of the marinade in the sauce. Then I finished the chops on the grill. Also doubled the sauce mixture and it took 20-25 min. to cook down, which is a must. I'm not a fan of any kind of vinegar, but this was great. Will make it again and again. Larry","I have to admit that the whole reason I found this recipe was because I had a good bottle of aged balsamic vinegar that I wanted to try. I did an ingredient search and found this one, and boy am I glad I did. I took another reviewer's comment about using any cut of meat and used pork tenderloin, because I didn't have any lamb at home. Boy was this good! The blend of herbs and the reduction sauce were great! Of course, because I changed the meat, my cooking times were longer, but everyone wanted more and said how good it tasted! Thank you soooooo much for the recipe!!!!","Whenever I saute Lamb, I do it in garlic infused olive oil....adds flavor without chunks of garlic","When I first read this recipe I wasn't sure what to expect; but I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't too impressed with the steaks I purchased (fatty and poor meat quality), but that isn't the recipes fault. The balsamic vinegar made for an interesting sauce. I used a more expensive 8 year old (aged) balsamic vinegar. It was a bit more spendy but worth it as it made the sauce wonderfully smooth. I highly recommend spending the extra money and getting a higher quality balsamic vinegar for this dish.","Very disappointed the first two times I tried this; altered the recipe a bit and it was delicious! Use any cut of lamb (trim excess fat) Brown meat in skillet with a little onion, garlic and OO. Remove lamb and add to pressure cooker with tray insert (use about 2 1/2 cups of water). Pressure cook the lamb for 20-23 minutes; turn off, let cool 5-10 minutes naturally then cool pressure cooker in cold water. Remove lamb, set aside and reserve stock/liquid for the reduction sauce! In a ziploc bag measure 2 generous Tbl. Rosemary and crush really well - then add 1 heaping Tbl. Thyme and 1 scant Tbl. Basil - salt and pepper to taste. Shake the seasonings until well blended. Place the lamb one piece at a time in the ziploc bag and coat evenly with spices - set on a foil lined cookie sheet. Place lamb in the broiler for 5-7 minutes; remove & set aside. Reduction sauce: needs to be doubled! I altered the ingredients/amounts for optimal flavor. 1 1/2 T Olive oil, 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar (make sure to use real good quality balsamic vinegar; the ingredients should not say 'red wine vinegar'!!), 1 T [unpacked] brown sugar (helps mellow the bold vinegar flavor), 1 1/2 c. lamb stock (reserved from the pressure cooker), 3 T butter Use the skillet the meat browned in; follow the directions for preparing the sauce. Reduce the sauce properly!!! Place the lamb in the sauce & allow meat to mingle for 5 minutes.","Wow! This dish was amazing, I did everything as said and it came out perfect. Though I cooked it for about 5 min on each side and it came out prefectly medium rare. I am only 17 years old with no cooking skills (just started cooking for my family once a week and this was my first dish) and this dish was extremly easy to make!","This could not have been easier to make! It was the first time I'd ever cooked with lamb, but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Awesome dish!","AMAZING! Made it pretty much just as the recipe describes. The only thing I changes was the thyme - I halved it cause my husband doesn't like the smell of thyme. Also, I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Oh and now that I scanned the list of ingredients I actually forgot to put in the butter in the end! It was still to die for!! Served it with oven roasted carrots (brushed with olive oil & sprinkled with paprika) and baked acorn squash (brushed with butter, sprinkled with brown sugar and chopped Turkish apricots). Husband loved it. I was thoroughly impressed. We deemed it one of our best dinners yet!","I was sooo surprised at how delisious this recipe was. I used goat chops instead of the lamb. I didnt have shallots so I used 2parts white onion and 1 part garlic. My seven yr old son ate 3!! and wanted more but me and his dad ate the rest. The reductions was sweet and not at all vinigary tasting, definatly need tpo be patient to let it reduce properly. I will be making this regulary!!","Absolutely perfect! Even with my slap-happy way of following a recipe it was still perfect. For the butter, I used homemade. I got that recipe here, you guys should try it:o) I also added the balsamic to the pan before the stock & due to the heat of the pan, it caramelized very quickly & nearly burned. Definitely add the stock first & let everything reduce as the recipe states. The lamb was cooked, (I hate to keep saying this), to perfection. Not only will I make this again, I'm passing out the recipe to everyone I know:o)","This was very good. Unfortunately, I ran out of good balsamic vinegar and only had the cheap kind. To counter the strong vinegar taste of the cheaper kind, I added a touch of honey, which balanced the flavors nicely. Next time, I'll use a better vinegar.",OMG!!! This is the best meal I've ever made!!! The sauce cooked down is unbelievible!!!! Going to cook a 11 lb. leg of lamb for Easter and make the sauce from the roasted pan drippings the same way. These chops are better than sex!!!,"This was a great way to serve chops. Hubby is generally pretty fussy about the way I cook lamb (he likes it fairly plain, with no fuss), but he devoured all I put on his plate, and asked for seconds. I did change one or two things though. I doubled the reduction and cooked it in a pan by itself while I was doing the chops (I ran out of time) First I cooked the shallots with a bit of garlic and some finely diced mushrooms in some butter, then I added the balsamic and stock to reduce. I also thickened it a little more with a touch of cornflour towards the end after I had added the butter. Lovely recipe, thanks for sharing.","5 stars, almost 600 reviews. That says it all. This is quick, easy and absolutely delicious! Do not hesitate to try this immediately! And, as others have said before, it is very important to let the sauce reduce down into a syrupy heaven! I doubled the sauce ingredients, and it took me about ten minutes or so for the reduction. The reduced sauce didn't LOOK very appetizing (sort of like jet-black, scorched motor oil) but man, the taste was out of this world!","Excellent! I made this tonight for guests and it was a hit. I thought the reduction sauce would be too pungent, but it was perfect. Next time, I'll definitely have to make more sauce...there wasn't enough to go around!",This was so good! BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE! I was searching for a recipe to make my chops stand out and this was WONDERFUL! I didn't have shallots like I thought I did :( so I used onion and it still was wonderful! Everyone loved it! I was told to save this recipe because it's to be used AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN! Thanks much!,"I wonder how much they would charge for this in a 3 stars restaurant! Very very good and classy! Since I had fresh rosemary, I didn't use thyme and basil, flavours would have been too strong. I also added a bit of sugar (maybe 1 tbsp) to cut the acidity of vinegar. Thanks for posting!","I loved it! I have never cooked lamb before, never thought about it because it is pricey. I got a deal on it and found this recipe, decided to try it. My boyfriend and I both loved it! I only used two chops, thats all I had, but i did the origioncal amount of sauce, so if i were to make four chops i would def double the sauce. My boyfriend was a little scared because of the thick vinegar smell in the house, and the sauce was clunky. Once he bit into it, he was in love! I Served with steamed carrots, which tasted great with the sauce over it! Also, a green salad. I will make as often as possible!!!","This was the first time I ever tried to cook lamb chops. This dish was fabulous. The taste is top notch, like your eating at a five star restaurant! You must give it a try!","Wonderful flavors! It was very easy and my husband loved it. I used dry minced onion instead of shallots and had to thicken the sauce with 2 tsp. of flour. Also, you could use this recipe on almost any cut of meat.","I really didn't care for this. I LOVE lamb, eat it at restuarants regularly, and I followed the recipe exactly (doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested, expecting to love this dish based on the reviews). It turned out horrible (couldn't get the vinegary sauce off the lamb to make it edible). Easily the worst allrecipes recipe that I've ever tried.","Delicious!!! love,love,loved it!!",,,,,,,

187,Great recipe. For those who said it should marinate for a few hours -- you can't marinate fish for hours. Max 30 min. You'll partially cook the fish. Fish isn't like meat.,"I followed the recipe the first time around and thought it was pretty good. When I make it now, I grate and add a little fresh ginger (1/4 to 1/2 tsp.) and a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce. I marinate the fish in some of the sauce for 30 minutes. To bake it, I spray wire racks with cooking spray and place them onto a large baking sheet and bake the fish on the racks as directed, basting at least once during the cooking time.","This recipe was outstanding! The glaze was easy to prepare in a small saucepan. I used a long filet instead of individual portions, and after it came out of the oven I folded the foil over it while I finished other things. The flavor permeated the fish beautifully, and left it nice and moist. A definite keeper.",Thank you. I've recently been diagnosed with Meniere's disease and must follow a very low sodium diet. A lot of the recipes I've found taste rather bland. This one is a wonderful exception. I used it with chicken last night and had the first tasty meal I've had in a while. Keeper!,"This arrived as a ""Daily Dish"" recipe on 2/14/08. I made this without changes substituting boneless skinless chicken breasts for salmon, baking it at 375 for around 30 minutes. Like some others, I was worried how this was going to turn out based on the way it smelled on the stovetop. It turned out wonderfully and I will incorporate this into my rotation of sauces. Thanks, Isybel!",We made this after I found the same recipe in my low-carb cook book. The only think they add in it is to add chopped Basil before serving. Fantastic dish!!! Served it with brown rice and garlic sauteed green beans. Will make this again for sure...very easy!,YUMM-O. This is really good. I did double the glaze because we really like our sauces...and I am glad that I did. The only thing I added was some green onions for color and a little bit of a crunch (after baking). I really liked it and hubby said it was good too. Definately will keep this in our rotation. Thanks for the post.,"This glazed salmon turned out wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly and did not make any changes. It almost turned into a disaster though as I mis-read 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar for 1/3 cup honey. I was 2 seconds away from adding the honey when I realized my mistake. The flavor had depth and my friends enjoyed it too. If you enjoy salmon, you'll enjoy this glaze.",We thought this was good. It did smell awful-but the end result was great. We did this 2x the second time used dill instead of oregano-better flavor! Thanks!!,"This is a staple in our house! It's quick, easy and delicious. My kids inhale this dish! It's also great in a pinch since I always have all the ingredients on hand.","I was really nervous to cook salmon because it is an expensive piece of meat to screw up! But, living in Alaska I have to take advantage of our natural resources! I made this recipe with a 1 1/2 lb Coho salmon. It was awesome. I didn't use the white wine, but used a tsp of lemon juice instead and I also used 2 tsp olive oil and 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano. This would have been great without changes, but this was just my preferance. I think next time I will reserve more of the sauce, because some of it ran off and then started to burn on the foil towards the end. Then I will have more sauce to top it with before serving. I served this with fresh green peas from the farmers market and homemade rosemary bread dipped in olive oil and vinegar. I think this would be really good with this recipe for green beans in the Taste of Home Magazine (I have yet to try). Here is that recipe: Balsamic green bean salad; 2 lbs fresh green beans, (trimmed & cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces), 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 Tbsp lemon juice, 3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp dry mustard, 1/8 tsp pepper, 1 large onion, chopped, 4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved, 1 cup crumbled feta cheese. You just cook beans until crisp tender (8-10 minutes), drain & place in ice water. Then mix the seasoning ingredients in a bowl and drizzle over beans. Then refrigerate for an hour and mix in tomatoes and cheese. One 3/4 cup serving = 77 calories, 5 g fat, 7 carbs, 3 g fiber, and 3 g protein.",It is so refreshing to read a recipe that actually uses fresh ingredients - so many others use cans of this or dried packets of the other! My only quibble with this recipe is that the skin should not have been regarded as so much rubbish - the fish should have been baked skin side up so that it (the skin) crisped up - absolutely delicious. That's how top chefs cook salmon and similar fish.,"This was great! My family gobbled it up. I used one big fillet, so it took a little longer to cook. As you're stirring the glaze in the pan, you might be thinking it's too vinegar-y, but it really comes out so yummy! I will definitely do this again! Oh, also, I didn't have white wine or the oregano and still loved it.","This recipe was great, I really enjoyed the flavors and it was easy to prepare. I didn't have any dijon mustard, so I used yellow mustard. I was worried that would upset the taste, but it was still really good, next time I'll try the dijon.","Very yummy recipe. I used a whole filet of Salmon. I followed the rest of the recipe to a ""T"". I also used parchment paper rather then foil - it works better to keep it from sticking. Thanks!",The flavors did not seem to mix well together. Will not try this one again.,"This was great. I substituted Splenda for the honey and basil for oregano. I doubled the sauce and poured half on the salmon and the other half over angel hair pasta. Also, I added orange peel to the pasta and squeezed the juice onto the fish after it was done. Really fantastic.","This recipe is excellent. Very easy. I was kind of leary of the balsamic vinegar, but it is delicious. Don't go lightly on the sauce smother it all over the salmon.","This was VERY good, I did add a bit more honey because it seemed a little too ""vinegary"" for my taste. Both hubby and I thought it was wonderful though - nice change from the usual.","Well, we LOVED it. No marinating. (I did skip the oregano.) I glazed the fillets, and let the remaining glaze cook down even more until syrupy to add to the fillets just before serving. I only had to cook my fillets for 8 mins and they were done - beware overcooked salmon! Served with balsamic/brown sugar carmelized onions (shallots)on top of fillets - SO GOOD! It was a hit.",This recipe was easy and tasted GREAT! My son raved about the salmon all afternoon. i'll be making this again soon. Thanks for this recipe.,"This was delicious! Of all the recipes I have recently tried for salmon, this was a favorite with my husband & boys.","We live in SE Alaska and thanks to my fisherman husband we eat fresh king salmon all the time. We were looking for something that didn't call for lemon as we were out, and found this. I had fresh oregano in my garden and all of the other ingredients on hand, although I did use sweet honey mustard. It was delicious. We will do this again when we have company.","This recipe came out great! I had no white wine, so used a little bit of lemon juice mixed with water instead. The glaze was delicious and the salmon was moist.",this was delicious!,,,,,,,,,,,

189,"I made this for the boys before I went to work last night. I did not try this myself but based on the message I got at my break--they absolutely loved it. To be honest, there were no leftovers for me! They thought the crust was the best part. Note to self: double the crust ingredients next time.","Oh boy! I finally found the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used only 12 oz. of macaroni, to make it more cheesy. It was a perfect ratio. I used 2% milk, and it worked great - creamy and satisfying. I don't know which I liked better, the crust or the filling, they were both delicious. You have to try this recipe! Thanks, Chef John!","Lordy, all anyone wanted was the crust. New rule, take what's UNDER the crust, too. This was the closest to my mom's, and all kidding aside, a terrific success.","My family really loved this dish. The only changes I made was 1/8 cayenne (because of kid), made only 12 oz. of macaroni and used black pepper. I didn't have panko crumbs so I made my own crumbs with leftover bread. To be honest, I can live without the topping so I'll leave it out next time. This will be my go-to mac and cheese recipe for now! UPDATE: This time I left out the thyme and worcestershire. I added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder to the roux. I used 10 oz. of macaroni. I didn't add the breadcrumb topping. I covered the dish with foil and baked it at 375° for 30 minutes, then uncovered and baked for 15 minutes more. Nice and creamy and so delicious. But I'll have to leave out the cayenne next time due to picky kid (although I love the kick of the cayenne). How anyone can say this macaroni and cheese is bland is beyond me. Perhaps you used cheap cheese which tends to be oily and doesn't have the best flavor and texture. And BTW, if your dish turns out grainy, you probably didn't take the bechemel off the burner and SLOWLY (1/4 cup at a time) add cheese to it while mixing gently. Dumping all the cheese at once to simmering bechemel that is still on the burner will result in a grainy texture.",Very good. I am thinking that the people who commented that they were overpowered by the taste of thyme must have used ground thyme instead of dried thyme leaves. 1/4 tsp. of dried thyme leaves is not enough to overpower anything.,"The best mac and cheese I have made in a long time. My family all stated the same. I followed the recipe with the exception of a couple of changes. After reading the reviews, I cut the pasta by a couple of oz and that worked out perfectly. I used fresh thyme, backed the ceyenne down to 1/8 teaspoon (my dad can't have spicey), and was out of dijon so I used about a 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard. We loved that it was baked but still creamy! Definitely reminds everyone of grandma's mac and cheese. I will use this recipe from this point. Thanks for sharing!","Tweaker alert. I used the basic recipe but changed the seasonings due to my ""NON-Gourmet"" children who will never eat Thyme flavored anything. The sauce recipe works fantastic & I was quite proud of myself for pulling this off. You should not leave the stove during the sauce whisking portion. The reviews talked a lot about sauce vs. pasta amounts. My men like sauce. I used a 16 oz large elbow macaroni package. I ""sort of"" doubled the sauce. It was perfect. I am writing this up because I use other people's suggestions all the time. Hope this helps someone! I used: 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 cup flour, 1 T. Chili Powder (think chili), 1/4 + teaspoon of Red Chili Flakes, 5 cups of 2% milk, 1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce, 3 tsp. Kosher Salt, 5 good handfuls of already grated Cheddar/Jack Mix (Costco), 1 good squirt of Dijon. Followed the sequence of directions, but changed the seasoning & amounts. For the crust - I discovered I DID NOT have the Panko Break Crumbs I thought I had. I used 2 T. Butter with 1/2 cup Italian Bread Crumbs + 1/4 c. Crunchy Onions (think green bean casserole), mixed well, sprinkled on top & baked in a 10 X 15 - greased. Wonderful - my men ate 1/2 of the tray last night & I am sure the rest will be gone today! Thanks Chef John for the basic recipe! Update: I still do what I wrote in my original ""tweak"" of this recipe, but if this is for an adult buffet, I have added jarred Jalapeno slices at the very last stage of putting it in the pan. It gets rave reviews!","EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! I don't review much recipes, and this is one worth to review! Please read! :) I wanted to use the 16 oz. of elbow macaroni, but also wanted it cheesy as well. So I ""almost"" doubled the wet ingredients (for the sauce). I found this to be a PERFECT RATIO for the 16 oz. macaroni. I used 3/4 cup butter, about 3/4 cup flour , 5 cups cheese total (I use half sharp cheddar grated myself and half regular cheddar) (reserving 1.5 cups of cheese for the top) and 5 cups of milk. I adjust the seasonings as accordingly as well! **I never add the nutmeg. I'm a bit scared putting nutmeg in this dish, even if it's just a pinch! LOL **Instead of the dijon mustard I use the mustard powder, and only use half the amount it states (only because I don't know how much of a mustard flavor it will pick up) **I up the panko bread crumbs to 1 cup, and the melted butter to 2 TBs. The crust from that is amazing. **I'm not a big fan of too much thyme, so I used italian seasonings instead. ** The cayenne pepper is great in this, but I usually half it if kids are eating it in case they're fussy. I have also sprinkled on crushed red pepper flakes instead. **I do not use ALL sharp cheddar cheese. I use half sharp (freshly grated myself), and half regular cheddar!!! **DO add the worsherchire sauce! This is soooooo good! I will never want to try another type of mac n' cheese recipe ever. Thank you for reading! :) ** I included a photo and it's photo #2.","Tried this recipe because I was starting to think my tried and true mac&cheese was a little bland. I was skeptical of the thyme so only filled the 1/4 tsp about 2/3 full. Followed everything else to a T. The thyme flavor was so overpowering, the dish was inedible.","I have tried this recipe and it was good. For those who thought it was a little dry, I have found over the years that mixing hot pasta with hot sauce only ends up with a very dry pasta after baking in the oven. So to fix this I always cool my pasta on the counter before I add it to any sauce. It stops the pasta from absorbing too much of the sauce and ending up dry. You can always make additional sauce, but that means extra calories. So I just cool the pasta while I am making the cheese sauce. I made a very small dish with the thyme but did not put it in the main recipe. Glad I did, the addition of thyme was terrible in my opinion.","Delicious! Very easy and kid-friendly. Use a little less pasta if you like your mac and cheese very saucy -- this wasn't overly saucy, but had great flavor. It's easy to make changes according to your likes.","I've tried a few mac and cheese recipes on this site and this is by far my favorite. It was easy to make. I read the reviews first, and learned that if I want a creamier mac and cheese to reduce the noodles, so I used 12oz instead of 16oz, which I think worked out perfectly. That's the only change I made. It had a nice combo of flavors, none being overpowering. I was slightly nervous that the cayenne pepper would be a little too spicy for my mom who hates anything spicy, but I didn't tell her that any pepper was in there and she didn't complain. :)","My family and I loved this! However, I tasted while cooking and intensified the seasonings, probably close to doubling the thyme, cayenne pepper and nutmeg. Also, for those who might not have the suggested cheese on-hand (like me), I used half gruyere and half colby jack and it worked out fine. I didn't like it when cooks rated a recipe high and then changed it, but it seems everyone does it and the ""here's what I dids"" are helpful.",The texture of the crust was amazing and the mac and cheese was creamy just how I like it. I think using only sharp cheddar made it a little too sharp for me. Next time I might substitute a cup or so of mild cheddar. But will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!,"I love this dish. I love this dish so much that when I make it, I force myself to cut the recipe down so that I don't end up eating a pound of mac & cheese in two days. The first time I made it, I followed the measurements exact and while amazing, I thought it could be improved. The second time, I doubled the spices and added some parsley, basil, and oregano and IT ROCKED! Like other reviewers suggest, I double the breadcrumbs for the topping. If I ever meet Chef John, I'm going to do a back flip just to show my appreciation for this recipe.","I've been looking for a good mac and cheese recipe for a long time, and watched the accompanying video. I followed his advice and used 1 cup smoked gouda cheese to replace 1 cup of the shredded cheddar. I also added 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese. Wow! It is wonderful! My family ate it up. I have a new favorite! I also only used 12 oz. of macaroni, to make the finished product a little looser. Watch the video!! It has some great tips in it.","Run, don't walk, to your local grocery and find the ""cheese remnants"" bin, purchase several that sound interesting....gruyere is a good one with white cheddar. Then go home and go to foodwishes.com and watch the tutorial by Chef John on this recipe. He makes it so easy! This is an excellent recipe-our whole family of 5 loves it!","I tried this recipe on my daughter son-in-law and granddaughter. it was a HUGE success. My granddaughter is 10 years old, had 3 helpings. Needless to say, there were no left-overs. thanks.","This was very good and the topping really added a punch to it. However, next time, I think I will omit the thyme. Even though it was only 1/4 tsp, I could still taste it and I don't think this dish needed it. I prefer thyme in my poultry dishes, not my mac-n-cheese.","YUM!!! I made this 3x in 2 days. The first time I left the thyme out on purpose, due to other reviews. But then I accidentally left the nutmeg out. It was still fantastic! The next day I made it for my boyfriend and his two teenage sons. They like spicy so I increased the cayenne pepper, but then accidentally left out the Dijon. It was still awesome! But I wanted them to have it with the Dijon so I made it again. I just got the confirmation - they love it!! This recipe is very forgiving. I've tried many others and nobody liked any of them. Until now. This is the best! (I will add that I made it two days ago but didn't bake it. They put it in fridge and then baked it tonight. So it does do well with premaking).","This was really great, I doubled the recipe since it said it only served 6. I brought this to a wing-night party and everybody loved it. The nutmeg gives it an interesting flavor from left field that's really quite satisfying. I also doubled the topping and used about 125% of the cheese required. Excellent! BTW - doubling the recipe (2x boxes of elbows) yielded 2 very full 9x11's.","This was wonderful! Quick and easy, I added brocoli and doubled the Panko-delicous thank you!",This was so blah. I'm not sure if I did something wrong because of all the high reviews. I won't be making again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
190,"OK folks - hang on for this. I am going to get really detailed in my review. (I noticed when I was reading the reviews that no one really gave finite detail of how they made this) I will say that it is great, and BASTE, BASTE, BASTE. I won't ever pay for a overpriced honeybaked ham again. OK, I had a 8 lb cooked, smoked spiral sliced ham. I halved the glaze and had the perfect amount (but I am a very generous baster). I used (keep in mind I halved it) 1/4 tsp of ground cloves, 1/4 c of brown sugar instead of the corn syrup, 1 cup of honey and I actually did about the same amount of butter as if I made the full amount. Now I also cooked mine in the slow cooker and it ended up a little dry, which was my fault. If you are going to do the slow cooker, give yourself a good 5 hours on low. I panicked with mine about 1/2 way through and upped it to high and it ended up dry. I applied the glaze about every 25 minutes. Make sure you keep the glaze warm and a huge tip! Line that crock pot with foil because the clean up is a bear. Personally, I used the new slow cooker liners and cleanup was a snap becuase you just throw the bag away. Be sure you have a good brush too - the baste is sticky and you will end up with hair all over. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I have never made a ham before and this one was great (also great the next day - my husband and I both liked it on sandwiches).","Absolutely Awesome! However, I did follow some of the other suggestions and use brown sugar instead of the syrup. I used about 1/3 cup butter, 1/2 C of brown sugar, and about 1/4 honey. You could adjust these however you want easy enough. I cooked this in my crockpot with baby carrots on the bottom on high for the afternoon (Had it on high so I could lift lid and baste). I had the ham scored and cloves in it. The carrots were the best I ever had! The ham was excellant! Sooooo juicy. This my new ham recipe!","I made this glaze for Easter and my family thought it was a local bought honey ham. My clean up was a breeze. I put my ham in one of those oven cooking bags. Instead of basting it I just poured it over the ham in the bag, sealed it up and just turned the whole bag it self every 15-20 min. I put it in a 9x13 foiled line pan but never got any glaze on it. Worked for me. I didn't use whole cloves but the ground ones. Good luck and enjoy. MMMM Good.",WOW! This is mouth watering delicious!**Line the pan with a LOT of foil** You will have a honey of a mess if you don't.I used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup. Cut the recipe in 1/2 or you will have a ton of glaze. I used a spiral 17 lb. ham & still had glaze eventhough I cut the recipe in 1/2.. Can't go wrong with this recipe. Just use plenty of FOIL!!!!!!!,"I used a slight variation of this recipe for Easter dinner. It was FANTASTIC!!! I had a 16 1/2 lb ham and used 2 cups of honey, approx 3/4 cups of brown sugar (instead of corn syrup) and 1 cup of butter - no cloves. It was ""thick"" enough to brush on with a grill brush and wasn't too drippy in the oven. Everyone RAVED!!! (used a CHEAP ham too!) Even the kids and my very picky father loved it!! I am keeping this one in my recipe file!",We made this for Christmas. Very good Turned out great! We put the ham & glaze in an oven bag and just flipped the bag every 15-20min instead of basting.,"1/3 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey baby carrots underneath , crock pot, lift lid and baste often, stud ham with cloves",I'm not the biggest ham fan- but it was great! It was a big holiday hit with my whole family. I added the juice from a can of pineapple rings to the sauce and then for the last 10 minutes of baking I garnished the ham with the pineapple rings. Beautiful and tasty!!,"Loved, loved, loved this ham!!!! First time I ever made a ham.(had to ask other shoppers what to buy...shank or butt? Shank won!) Excellent recipe even though I used brown sugar instead of the syrup and omitted the cloves(hate cloves..yuk). Will definetly make this again!","This make a great presentation ham, just like the picture. Luckily the baste does make a lot because we could not reuse anything that cooked off because the honey separated under the aluminum foil and the butter remained on top (baked honey is a lot of fun to clean). My husband and I have never made a ham before so we had to do some reasearch to what ""score"" means. To score a ham means to cut diagonally at 1"" intervals, cutting about 1/4"" deep. (score in opposite direction to make a diamond shape.) This made a great dinner ham but we didn't care for the flavor when used as leftovers for sandwiches.","Came out great! I used an 8lb spiral cut ham. I used 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1 cup of honey and just a few cloves for the glaze based on previous reviews. I used most of it, but kept a little for the end. I used an oven bag and flipped it over every 15-20 minutes to baste, it ended up breaking towards the end. At the end I took off the bag, brushed with a little more glaze I had not used, and put some brown sugar all over the ham, then broiled it on low for about 3 minutes for the crispy sugar layer the fancy pre-made hams come with. Watch the broiler it crisps fast. I followed the cooking instructions from the ham since it was precooked spiral cut, and cooked it on 275 for 10 minutes per lb to prevent drying out and it came out juicy and delicious. I served with cheesy potatoes and honey & brown sugar carrots cooked in the glaze.","This is as close to the honey baked ham that I have found. The only thing that was missing was the crunchy topping so after I basted and cooked the ham, I put brown sugar on top and broiled it for about 2 to 3 minutes you just have to watch it so that it will not burn.","Better than the famous honey baked ham at the store. I have some good tips! I used an ordinary Kirkland spiral ham from Costco...about 8 pounds. I think buying a spiral ham is key because all the glaze can get into the slices. I don't score it. I take the cold ham and pull the slices open, one at a time and pour the warm glaze into the meat. I flip it over and do the same to the other side of the slices. Then I put the ham meat side down on the pan and do another pour of the glaze over the whole ham. I bake mine at 275 for 12 to 15 per pound. I find that baking at this lower temperature makes it much more moist! I do baste, but not as often as the recipe calls for-I'm too busy and I don't use a brush -just pour glaze on the ham w/ ladle. When the ham comes out, and as it rests a bit, I take a turkey baster and suck up all the hot ham juices/honey/sugar from the baking pan and start basting all the slices again as it cools!! It sucks up all the yumminess like you wouldn't believe. I carve it up and place the slices on a big plate and for good measure, pour a little bit of the pan juices over the slices. I found that the amount of glaze this recipe makes was enough for an 8 pound ham. I also used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup like the others mentioned. I did't have whole cloves, so I put a tiny pinch of ground cloves in the sauce (but a very small pinch since it's strong). Didn't do double boiler, but kept on stove and heated it only as needed, mostly stove's off.","REALLY good glaze. The husband was so worried about me trying my own glaze instead of using a pre-glazed ham but one bite was all it took to calm his fears. I got a spiral cut ham and this made a delicious, light glaze that was wonderful on the outside but not so strong that it overpowered the meat. Followed reviewer's advice to use brown sugar instead of corn syrup and put the ham in an oven bag for easier glazing and clean up. WOW!","My first attempt at a ham. My kids were skeptical when I told them I was making a ham, as we're not big ham eaters. I used a bone in spiral cut smoked ham from Costco, 9lbs. I used 2/3c butter, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4c brown sugar and 1c honey. Placed in crockpot for 6 hrs on low and basted every 30mins. Added baby carrots after 3 hrs. This glaze is AMAZING! The carrots were delicious and the ham was awesome! My kids were happily suprised and I received many many compliments. Will definitely make this for years to come!","I read the reviews & this ham sounded wonderful, so I made it for the Holidays. The flavor was delicious. My 7-lb ham was literally covered in cloves & I still had about an 1/8 cup left, so you don't really need that much. Also, 1 hour & 15 minutes is way too long if you have a spiral sliced ham, as it got a little dry through the 1st 5 or 6 layers, but the glazed soaked in really nice & so it still had a wonderful flavor. It does make a lot of glaze, but we saved it for the left overs & re-heated it serving it in little ramekins to dip ham pieces in as you would au jus, & that made it fun & yummier. I think I might try cooking the glaze down a bit next time to get a thicker & less runny consistency so that I can cook the ham for a shorter period. Thinking 45 minutes would do fine for spiral cut & 1 hour for non cut for a moister ham. The orange juice idea also sounded tempting, so might also try adding that the next time. All & all though, this is an excellent base recipe with room for personal touches. Mahalo Colleen! (Thank You)","I wish I could add more stars to my review because this ham turned out great! I used a 9-1/2 lb butt portion ham that was not fully cooked. I cooked it for two hours with just a little water and pineapple juice in a pan tented with foil. I was using a meat thermometer, so once the temp reached about 100 degrees, I glazed it and let it cook until it reached 140 degrees. I halved the recipe for the glaze and it was more than enough for the ham. I also used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup. I didn't broil it at the end and I kept the foil on it for the entire cooking time so it didn't dry out. I can't believe how good this ham tasted. Our guests were taking samples as my husband was slicing it for the dinner. I'll never again buy a honey-baked ham for the $50 or whatever it is they charge!",This is a recipe that must be altered to your taste preference and based on the size of your ham. I used brown sugar in place of the corn syrup and used ground cloves rather than whole. Baste regularly and it turns out lovely every time.,"Hints: This is the 10th time I've made this ham. I put about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice in the glaze and ground cloves instead of studding the whole ham. This is just another variation. We have 3 little ones, so they don't like pulling out cloves! Best ham I've ever made. Just wonderful taste. I also put a little ground clove in the glaze for added flavor. Some pointers: Seriously, really line the pan with aluminum foil. I only put a flimsy piece in, and the glaze got underneath, and burned into this immovable glob of gunk. I traded pans halfway through the cooking. The ham was still the best though! I just had to throw out the pan!","This is so good, make sure you keep the sauce warm for basting, I use a mini crock pot to keep it warm.","Due to having a diebetic in the house we used 2 cups of agave nectar in place of the honey and only used 2 tablespoons of cornsyrup. We didn't tell anyone we made the switch and got rave reviews and our diebetic got to have ""honey glazed ham"". Hope this helps those who have health issues.",Do you remove the skin before cooking and adding the glaze or do you leave the skin on?,"My Easter ham came out great. The only complaints I might have is that I had a TON of the glaze leftover. Also, make sure you have a GREAT basting brush. The glaze is quite thick and you'll end up with hairs on your ham if you use a ratty old brush.","I thought this was excellent with just a few changes for personal preference. First, I use brown sugar instead of corn syrup. Second, I use 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves in place of whole cloves. And lastly, I cut down on the amount of the other ingredients. So for me, I mix together 1/3 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg. I'm not a fan of cooking bags (just personal preference), so I triple line a 9X13 pan with foil and baste every 15 minutes. Super yummy! No more expensive honey baked hams for me!","This is a fantastic glaze! I followed other reviewers advice and cut the honey in half, substituted brown sugar for the corn syrup and used 1 tsp ground cloves as I had a spiral sliced ham. This made just enough glaze to do a 11 1/2 lb ham. wonderful!!! Thanks for sharing!",very good recipe! I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and added some pineapple juice.,"I used 1/2C brown sugar instead of corn syrup, 3/4C butter, and only 1C honey (no cloves) - and it was more than enough to coat and baste my 7 lb, pre-sliced ham with a bit left over. I rubbed on some brown sugar with about 10 minutes' baking time left...turned out delicious! The leftover meat was refrigerated with the leftover glaze, which left it moist and flavorful. Mmmm! Will likely use this recipe again for Christmas. :)","I used this recipe for the ham I cooked on Christmas. It was DELICIOUS! I used brown sugar instead of corn syrup as well. I poured the glaze on for the first time after 20 minutes of being in the oven, and basted every 15 after that. At the end, I sprinkled raw dark brown sugar on the top of the ham and turned on the broiler to make a crunchy glaze. Wonderful.",,,,,,,,
191,"I have become famous for making this lasagna. It really is a fabulous recipe. One thing to note, though, is that cottage cheese will not work for lasagna -- you need to get the 15-oz. container of WHOLE MILK ricotta. Also, a good idea is to bake it for the 30 minutes the night before, keep it in the refrigerator, and the next day, sprinkle the 1/2 pound of mozz on top and then bake for 15 minutes before serving. That way, the flavors gel overnight, but you still get the feeling of eating the lasagna ""fresh"".",I made this for a crowd Christmas Eve. I thought it was terrible even after trying to kick it up a knotch with additional spices and meat. I used top of the line ingredigents. Very disappointing. I should know by experience not to trust ratings esp on a holiday! Some one said it tasted like Stouffers Lasagna---and it did! Save your self the trouble and buy Stouffers. I am sorry but stouffers is not my idea of good lasagne---just a quick cheap substitute in a pinch.,"This was excellent! I've only made lasagna one other time and this was so much better. I did use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese only because of what I remember about eating cottage and peaches as a snack as a kid (ARGH). Never want cottage cheese again. Instead of no-bake noodle or boiling the noodles, I placed them in room temperature water for about 40 minutes and that worked great. (got this from someone else on AllRecipes) I added about 1 teaspoon of basil and a bay leaf to the sauce while it simmered. Be sure to remove the bay leaf! Since it's only me and my 21 year old son at home, I have a lot of leftovers and it was exceptional the next day. I also shared with my niece and her 2 year old and they loved it!!","Excellent lasagna. I added riccotta cheese instead of cottage like everyone else did...GOOD idea! also, added: white wine, italian seasoning, fresh-chopped parsley, and mushrooms to the sauce. It really adds flavor to it. In addition, instead of cooking the sauce, I put it in the slow-cooker for an hour on high, then on low all day which really makes the sauce shine. Just remember to add a bit of water and/or wine to it throughout the day. Best stuff you'll ever taste!",Excellent! I used cottage cheese and no-boil noodles. This lasagna is different how you don't layer everything like other lasagnas. I think this helps it stay together. Very tasty! We split it into 10 servings and each serving was a perfect portion.,"I have tried several different lasagnas now and this is mine & my husband's favorite so far. I added 1 (10-oz) package frozen spinach with the parmesan & egg, only used 4 oz cottage cheese, and used 1 cup shredded mozzarella and 1 cup shredded cheddar in place of the 1 lb mozzarella. The sauce had a wonderful flavor and I would use it again for pasta (but the Slow Cooker Spinach Marinara from this site is my favorite). My husband commented that it was a little too saucy and could've used the addition of mushrooms and more cheese.","I made 6 9x13 pans of this for a dinner of about 30 people. I got so many compliments! It was easy to assemble and with the basic ingredients, it appealed to everyone. I did substitute ground turkey for the beef since we don't eat red meat but it did not affect the taste - obviously because no one else knew about the switch!! I'll make this for my family next time it's lasagna night!!","I made this for a family that I work for, tried it, and was blown away. VERY VERY GOOD. I might have put more seasonings in it, as I like my food very flavorful. It was perfect, am making it again tonight!","Like everyone else, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars. Both my husband and I loved this lasagna. It is by far the best lasagna we've had. The sauce isn't difficult to make but it's very tasty. The only thing I changed was substituting the cottage cheese with ricotta because I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand. This is my new lasagna recipe!","This recipe is amazing!! Usually I use ricotta cheese but I went with my gut and decided to try the cottage cheese and I'm so glad I did! It definitely gives it a creamier texture. I did take another users advice and added some basil, bay leaf, and fresh mushrooms it really adds to the flavor. Also I used Sargento artisan Parmesan and Romano for the cottage cheese mixture and the noodle layer and used Sargento mozzarella & asiago cheese for the top layer. Delicious!! Also, I soaked the noodles in room temp water for about an hour and what a difference it makes in the texture, no more boiling again!! Thank you for such a yummy recipe!","This lasagna is so good! It's one of the simplest recipes I've seen, but that does not mean it's not one of the tastiest. The only change I made was I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. The cheese mixture of ricotta, parmesan, and egg seemed a little dry for spreading, so I added about 1/4 cup of milk to soften it up. My husband and I love this lasagna! It's one of his favorite dinners that I have made for him, so I'll be making it again.","I having been experimenting with different lasagna recipes over many years. Some have been complicated and very expensive. Not only is this recipe easy and inexpensive, it is one of the best! I was very surprised to learn how wonderful creamy cottage cheese worked in this recipe. My only complaint is there were no leftovers!","Awesome!! Great recipe, the meat sauce makes the dish. I find it amusing that people on here seem upset that cottage cheese is used instead of ricotta. Please get over it, it's about taste and some people don't like ricotta...move on people, this is great lasagna","We could not stop eating this! I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta, and also used 1/2 lb. ground pork and 1/2 lb. ground beef (instead of just beef). I also added a layer of fresh spinach to try and get something green in there... it was delicioso!! Thanks.",I am 66 and have been making this lasagna since I was old enough too cook. Everyone always ravs about my lasagna.,"yum, yum, and did I say yum. next time I make this, will use less salt",My son made this lasagna last evening for dinner using the no-boil lasagna noodles. I enjoyed the tomato sauce made from the crushed tomatoes. Just the right amount sauce so the lasagna wasn't dry but not soupy. Very good lasagna!,I think this is a great base recipe. I add a lot of garlic and onion as well as fresh basil to the meat. I keep the meat separate from the red sauce to create more layering effect. I also use a combo of ground turkey and chicken italian sausage instead of ground beef to heighten the flavor. I also use part cottage cheese and part ricotta for additional creaminess. The last change I do is no-cook lasagna noodles. Less work and pots dirty. So basically I modified this recipe with the original as sort of a framework for all my changes. A good starting point.,"mmmmmm, what a luscious recipe this is!! i followed the directions as written with the minor exceptions of substituting barilla's ""no boil"" lasagna noodles for the regular kind & using a mozzarella/provolone blend of cheese (what i had on hand). remember to let your lasagna rest after baking so it sets up for easy serving. thank you linda!","This is my favorite lasagna. I've tried other people's homemade lasagne and this stays my favorite. You can add spinach, or different cheeses or stay classic. I usually substitute the ""sauce"" with Catelli's Garden Select pasta sauce (all Real ingredients) and extra garlic it up for my husband.","My Fiancee loved your Linda'a Lasagna! When I made lasagna with Ricotta Cheese he didn't like it. He doesn't like cottage cheese. So I didn't tell him. And I have a problem with tomato paste and tomatoes so I added 2 tsp of soda to cut the acid. It turned out beautiful!!! Hey, Thanks!!!","I am an Italian girl and while this is NOT traditional Italian lasagna, it is saucy and delicious and honestly my favorite of any I have eaten. I am famous for this lasagna! I usually substitute soy crumbles to make it vegetarian, and no one knows the difference.","There are two foods that I love to try all kinds of recipes when making: lasagna and chili. This recipe for lasagna is a no fail recipe. It is delicious! I have tried many and this one is one of the best. I did make a couple of adjustments, although, they don't really alter the recipe enough to make a huge difference. One, I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and left out the water. Secondly, I did not boil the noodles, I layered them dry. I baked it for 45 minutes, covered. Then uncovered it and added the remaining mozzarella and baked it for about 15 more minutes. I have tried ricotta in lasagna before, but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the cottage cheese. I also think adding a half pound of italian sausage would be divine. Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!",Great as is!!,This Lasagna was AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly! thank you for sharing it! My family raved about it!,I t was suprisingly delicious. I took a look at the ingredience and thought it looked very simple and that it might taste alreight but to my delight it was amazing!,,,,,,,,,,
192,"I loved this. I followed it to a tee with the exception of using a boneless 2 pound roast (I'm a one person family). I used the other ingredients at their original volumes though and it made an absolutely awesome mushroom gravy. I served it over egg noodles. The leftovers were even better! The house smelled amazing while it cooked. True comfort food and a keeper recipe. Thanks, Chef John!",This is almost identical to the recipe I have used to cook pot roast for quite some time except I do mine in the same Dutch Oven I use to sear the roast and then put into the oven at 250 degree for 4 hours or even longer. I do have 2 quibbles with his recipe however: 1) I normally use a 50/50 ratio of beef broth & dry red wine and 2) In those circumstances dried herbs will work at least as well and be far less expensive.,"This is an excellent recipe. I didn't have time to brown the meat ahead of time, so I just put everything in the slow cooker for 10 hours and it tasted fabulous. Will definitely make again.",I'm a fairly proficient slow cooker user and have made many a pot roast in mine. I have to say this recipe went so far beyond my expectations as to be astounding. The true center of this recipe is the braising of the beef. I went beyond my usual Carmel color and went ahead to an almost blacked meat. The reward was some of the most beautiful sauce I've ever had in a pot roast. About 1/2 an hour before completion I added several quartered potatoes just because and the sauce made them the other star of this great meal. I've used several of your recipes over the past year or so but really wanted to provide comment on this one as one of your finest. Good old fashioned America cooking on steroids! Thanks for all you do Chef John.,"Okay for the most part. ""Pot Roast"" is not a specific cut of meat, but with many cuts used (certainly the chuck roasts populr in the US) this is likely to come out overly fatty. The flour is not necessary- use a nonstick pan to brown the meat. If you want to use flour to thicken the liquid, it should be added near the end- long cooking will destroy most of it's thickening ability.. I have no idea what the food industry has against beef stock, but it's a better choice here (and many other places) than chicken.","Great recipe, and the mushrooms/onions/garlic mixture on top of the meat is great; I used this as a basis for my crockpot pot roast today. The only things I did differently were to use beef broth instead of chicken broth (seems a better fit, reinforces the beef flavor), and deglazed the mushroom/onion mixture with 1 cup of red wine (scrape the bottom to get all the good bits, then simmer until the wine is reduced), and then used just one cup of beef broth. Nothing smells better than pot roast cooking all day long in your home! I posted the recipe and photos in my blog, www.culinaryspirits.wordpress.com .","I've made this recipe twice, both times its turned out fantastic! Second time I made a few tweeks based on other reviews. I used a 3.13 pound boneless roast (for 2 people with leftovers) and seared it until almost burnt on both sides, ie got nice dark coloring and a nice crust on the roast. Only additions/changes I did were: I quartered Yukon Gold potatoes (like 6-8 potatoes) and put them in with the celery and carrots at the bottom of the pot. I put the roast right from the searing pan into the crock pot on top of the veggies and let it rest in there instead. I used Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth and got a great rich flavor and I added 1 Tablespoon Low Sodium Worcestershire to the mushroom/onion/broth mixture and let simmer before I poured over the meat. It smelled great when I walked in the door and made a great dinner (and leftovers) on a cold October night after work! Highly recommend!!!! Thanks Chef John!",This was the best recipe i have found so far. I have been trying for so long to make a tender roast and end up with something quite similar to a brick... In this recipe I put the crockpot on low instead and used chuck roast with a lot of marbling and it was amazing! Thank you Chef John!,"Someone mentioned about not tasting the fresh herbs. fresh herbs should be put in towards the end of the cooking time, otherwise they lose their intense flavor. Maybe more should be added towards the end.",Great dinner and leftovers make a great stew for later on. I make one addition. I add two tablespoons of Sweet Vermouth.,"This recipe is a real winner!! Be sure to follow the directions through and you will be extremely satisfied. It takes about 20-30 to prep the meat and sauce before you add it all to the crock pot. So if you're making it before you leave to work, remember that. Once I came home, it was perfectly tender and ready to eat. I removed some of the juice in the pot and made a easy gravy. Start with the roux, equal parts butter and flour in sauce pan, whisk together til it looks like frosting. Then slowly add the juice that you removed from the crock pot. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer and boil til it reaches your desired thickness.","This was delicious, no need for gravy,the mushroom mixture really keeps the meat tender and very flavorful! My husband loves to serve with egg noodles and red cabbage. Reminded me of Sunday night family dinners when I was a kid only better, a family favorite!","We liked this dish very much. It did indeed need salt pepper after cooking. I also wish I could've tasted the rosemary and thyme more. Perhaps I will try adding a bit more next time. Any suggestions? I followed the recipe except using a top roast and adding red potatoes to this dish, excellent!",Have eaten pot roast all my life but this one takes the cake. chef: JOHN,"Delicious! As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted beef broth & red wine for the chicken broth and threw some peeled, quartered potatoes in the slow cooker about 1.5 hours before the end of cooking. Also, I used a 3 lb boneless chuck roast. The meet was tender and the sauce/gravy was delicious! Will definitely cook again!","YES YES YES!!!!! (i added a splash of red wine with the chicken broth...ok maybe more than a splash) You have to sear the meat as John says, it gives it depth. I have also made this using herbes de provence for the seasoning",Soooo good. I used rib roast in place of chuck roast. My family loved it.,"My family said this is the best roast I have ever made, not really any ""leftovers"" left. Followed recipe exactly except I had to use dried herbs and after reading previous reviews, I added a little more salt and pepper. I got a late start so ended up cooking in oven at 250* for about 4-4.5 hours. They didn't even want to bother with eating it over noodles or mashed potatoes. Next time I will add potatoes, but will have to use larger roast if I want leftovers or plan to feed more than just my hubby and 11 yr old son as they devoured a 2.5 lb roast. I wasn't sure about the chicken broth, but the rave reviews erased my doubts and the house smelled fantastic!","Loved this receipe. Used what I h on hand so used boneless roast, canned mushrooms vs fresh, added sherry wine to broth. I love vegetables so doubled carrots and celery and added some potatoes I had on hand.","I used a 3 lb. boneless tip roast and omitted celery due to our personal preferences. I also used jarred pre-minced garlic, dried herbs, pre-sliced baby bella mushrooms, and just under 16oz. baby-cut carrots to make it easier. I'm no chef and accidentally added the tomato paste before the flour, LOL, but this roast was delicious! I didn't even bother trimming the meat like I usually do (was running out of time for it to be ready for dinner) and the fat literally just fell off the meat when pulled out of the cooker. The resulting liquids resembled a sauce or gravy of sorts, and was tasty on the mashed potatoes. This recipe is the very first thing I've ever cooked in a slow-cooker. (Grandma's '70s 4 or 5qt. old-school cooker lol! Thanks Grandma!) I love that this is the only roast I've found so far that included rosemary (my absolute favorite herb) and also thought it was super cool that it did NOT include creamed soup or liptons onion soup mix (not that I'm hating on those recipes... they are really yummy too!). Thanks for such a delicious addition to my recipe box. I'm sure it will be a recurring meal for us here! :)","Cooked a 4½ lb boneless roast (that came tied from the butcher) for 7 hrs in the crock pot, for four people, and it turned out GREAT! Everyone agreed that it was the best roast and best gravy they had ever eaten; even after we were done, we stop ourselves from picking at the leftovers. The roast was literally falling apart and had it not been tied, I could not have gotten it out of the crock pot. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used ½ cup red wine and increased the chicken stock (concentrated) to 4 cups.",Simply Delicious! Even my 11 yr old who hates anything other than hamburgers asked for seconds.,Best pot roast I have ever made. I did double the amount of fresh thyme and rosemary as per another reader's suggestion. The gravy was spectacular; I loved the fresh taste without the overload of salt you get when you add dried soup mixes or condensed soups. Served with yukon gold mashed potatoes. Awesome meal!,I seasoned with tenderizer mccormicks steak seasoning garlic salt onion salt ground pepper. Floured and seared. In same pan sautéed onion and garlic. In slow cooker 1 can beef stock add roast put package of onion soup mix w/ a little water then add onion and garlic. Keep on low until it simmers lower to keep warm. Add veges to crock and turn back to low. When simmers turn back to keep warm. Moist not over cooked.,"I was psyched by all the rave reviews on this recipe. The beginning seemed fairly labor intensive for cooking in the crockpot (I usually stick to the ""just dump everything in"" kind of recipes) but figured if it helped me make a decent pot roast, it would be well worth it. Unfortunately, my labors did NOT pay off. I followed the recipe EXACTLY with the exception of using dried herbs vs. Fresh. My pot roast came out very dry, and when I say very dry I mean we could hardly eat it.",I just made this and it was great. I didn't change a thing and it was perfect. Thank you for the great recipe.,"My first attempt at a crock pot roast - absolutely fantastic! I don't like mushrooms, but it was still amazing. Cooked pretty much as the recipe stated except that at the end I added some cornstarch/water to help thicken my gravy. My cut of meat was a Beef Eye Round Roast, 3.52 lbs. I cooked on high for 5 hours, then reduced to low for probably another hour.","Another hit! As Chef John indicates in the video, using the correct technique is important. Definitely worth the time to give your roast a good sear along with prepping the mushroom and onion to a caramelized state prior to adding to slow cooker. Only minor change I made was to use 2 cups (homemade, no sodium) chicken broth and ½ cup dry red wine. If you’re using the 7-bone roast, plan to spend some time skimming off the fat. Served over extra wide buttered egg noodles.",THE BEST POT ROAST!!!!I used 1 can of chicken broth and 3/4 cup of red wine. Cooked it on top of the stove for 6 hours. Sooo good!,"Loved this recipe as I LOVE all of Chef John's recipes!! I always add to my recipes, just because that's who I am LOL.. anyway, used a 6 lb boneless ""English Roast"" cause that is all I had on hand, added 1-1/2 cups of red wine to deglaze pan after I added the tomato paste (a bit more than called for), added way more carrots, mushrooms and garlic (cause I have a big eatin family), added ""quartered"" red potatoes about 1-1/2 hrs prior to turning the crock pot off (because I was lazy and didn't feel like making mashed). I turned crock pot on lowest setting and cooked all day YUM YUM!! Also, no fresh spices that day so I used dry. I am not a lover of THYME, so I will leave that out next time haha(PERSONAL CHOICE!!!). Also I always add more spice than recipes call for, just because we like a LOT of spice!! Next day, served dish with spetzle and OMG was it GOOOOOOD! Thanks Chef John for another GREAT RECIPE! LOVE YOU MUCH :) and Bon Appétit!","This is the best pot roast I have ever made. All I can say is wow. Reminds me of the way my mom made it growing up. Tender pot roast, wonderful flavor and a good smelling house too. Fabulous served over mashed red potatoes with the homemade gravy on top. No changes for me, I like it the way it is.","Just made this for dinner with guests and it was a HUGE hit. I've made lots of roasts and this was pretty much the best I've had. I used a 3 pound sirloin roast, cut the chicken broth a bit and added a half cup of red wine. Also used dry vs fresh rosemary and thyme. Flavor was fabulous.",This recipe was absolutely amazing! I wasn't able to find a 5lb bone in roast. I used a 3lb boneless. I also didn't use mushrooms because of a food allergy. The meat was moist and tender and so delicious! I strained the juices and added a flour slurry and made a gravy. I also added small white potatoes and had a complete meal in the one crock pot! It was delicious. My boyfriend devoured it. I would absolutely make this again.,,,

194,"Update: I made a double batch of these (to freeze for later use), and baked them on a lightly oiled baking sheet. 400 degree oven, turning once after 12 - 15 minutes then baking an additional 12-15 minutes. The results were great. Less oil absorbed than with pan frying, and the ""crab"" cakes came out crispy and golden, with a lot less mess and work. I've also made this with the commercial Italian Bread Crumbs. The flavor was out of this world! Outstanding! These make a wonderful vegetarian dinner when served with sliced tomatoes (topped with a dab of mayo) and fresh corn on the cob. These were so good that I make them at least once a week during the summer. I followed the suggestions of others, by lightly salting and draining the shredded zucchini before combining with the other ingrediants. The butter gives it a rich decadent taste!","This is an update from my last review of this recipe. This time I took the advice from Roger who reviewed a spinach recipe and suggested using a potato ricer to squeeze out the water from the spinach. I tried his idea with the zucchini and I can't tell you how well it worked. For those who are commenting on the saltiness of the Old Bay (which I agree with), there are several copy cat recipes out there which would enable you to control the sodium. I did take the advice from other reviewers and added an extra tsp. of ""Old Bay Seasoning"". I also added some garlic and onion powder and some black pepper along with a little cayenne. Yes, they are a tad bit difficult to handle, but if you flour your hands and LIGHTLY roll them into a ball and then pat them into a patty, it's not too bad. I used a Fry Daddy which made the job very quick and easy without the cakes tasting too heavy or greasy. Thanks Patti and Connie too!!!!","These were very good. I worried about the zucchini being too watery, so I shredded it into a collander and added about 1/2 tsp. of salt. I let it drain for about 30 minutes (pressing slightly with wooden spoon)...yielding about 2/3 cup water. I will definitely make these again.","This one gets RAVE Reviews!!!! I have made this recipe 5 times in the last 2 weeks. I modified it slightly in that I used 1 large zucchini and 1 large potato. I made sure I squeezed all of the liquid from these in order to insure an easier mixture to work with. Instead of coating with flour, I used the Japanese bread crumbs and coated each side and fried them. I have made them ahead but coated them with the bread crumbs just before frying. That way they don't get soggy. I left the melted butter out the second time and I didn't see any difference. This is certainly a great recipe. My daughter and I love them and I would serve them as a side dish for company!!!! You must try these.","This is the best zucchini pattie recipe I've ever tried. I used 1 more egg to substitute for butter. Also I didn't have Old Bay Seasoning at hand so I used a combination of black pepper, mustard, minced celery, nutmeg, ground cloves, cayenne pepper, paprika and ginger (I tried to imitate Old Bay Seasoning as much as I could) and the result was just fantastic! Thanks Connie!!","A very good side dish, though not much of a vegetable dish. You will definitely want to ""drain"" the zucchini. I spread mine to a thin layer on parchment paper, cover with paper towels, sprinkle a little salt, and use a rolling pin to press out the water. Repeat this process several times and you won't regret it. It does use a fair amount of paper towels, though. I use Emeril's Essence instead of Old Bay Seasoning and it tasted wonderful. Add the bread crumbs gradually. It is easy to add too much even at the given amount. This results in a finished product that tastes like stuffing and is very dry. Enough bread crumbs have been added when the mixture just barely holds together when flattened into a patty. Bon Apetit.","Great recipe! I've made this a few times and found that the small to medium zucchini works best. I drained and squeezed out zucchini, added more Old Bay and froze patties before cooking. Freezing makes them easier to handle and you can cook as many or as little as you want.","These are absolutely incredible! They are a bit messy to make and I drained the zucchini all day with a weight on top. But, they are so incredibily delicious that I did not mind the mess one bit. Here's a little tip: if your mix is really wet then form the patty in your hand, sprinkle flour on one side, pat it in then turn over and do the same thing on the other side. Then kind of gently toss in the pan. I had no trouble as long as I rinsed my hands after every couple of patties. My husband does not like squash and he scarfed these right down. They are incredibly tasty!","I'm not a big fan on ""crab"" anything, but loved the taste in these babies. They really are delicious. We live near the Chesapeake Bay and my husband enjoys crab cakes when we go to certain restaurants. I made these for him and he was really impressed. I couldn't believe he ate more than one. He really likes Old Bay and I guess that's what did the trick for him. I strongly suggest you squeeze the zuchinni completly dry with paper towels before you attempt this recipe, otherwise you may have some issues. Other than that, it's perfect as is. Thanks Patti Jo","I wish I video taped my meat eating brother in-law's face when he tried these. It was like christmas morning. I sqeezed the cr*p out of the zucchini with paper towels, dredged them in panko bread crumbs instead of flour and baked them at 400 degrees F, 12 min on each side per another reviewer. I've made them like, a gillion times. Sooooo awesome!","I just made these. However, I also needed to change the recipe. I used panko crumbs as well. I also added salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic power, dried mustard and I probably increased the Old Bay by at least 2-1/2 times. I also didn't use the flour, and I opted to bake at 400 w/ a little olive oil. I'm giving it a 3/5 because without the extra ingredients I think it would be on the bland side. My mother really enjoyed my version and I will be making her more to store in the freezer.","Excellent! I didn't change the ingredients at all (and didn't press out the zucchini after grating, either). I didn't flour, but baked on a cookie sheet (13 minutes at 400, flip and 10 minutes at 400). Perfect, and it was wonderful. I can see making these regularly! Comes to 4 WW points+ each (18 points for 5), but well worth it. Thank you!!!","Excellent! We've made them twice so far in the last few days and can't get enough. We get vegetables from our garden and a local co-op, and we've had a lot of zucchini of late that we needed to try something new. Thankfully I found this on here! To change things up, we made a batch with grated carrots mixed in and another one with equal parts grated yellow squash and zucchini, along with chipotle powder, chopped onions, garlic scapes, and even a grated radish. We made them for guests and had them topped with tartar sauce... our guests gobbled them right up! A great recipe as is, and even better when you find other combinations that work well when you want to change it up. Looking forward to trying these leftovers topped with an egg in the morning!","Hubs had one of these. I had four of 'em. He SAID he liked them, but actions speak louder than words. I had four of them. They were awesome good. Didn't taste even remotely close to crab cakes, but boy they sure were delicious. I added some fresh minced garlic and that was a good thing - it added a burst of flavor these might have been lacking otherwise. Awesome. I'll be dreaming about these.","I always wonder why all you good cooks don't peel the zucchini? Who has ever seen bright green flecks in a Maryland crab cake? It's a very nice recipe. To the reviewers who said it didn't taste like crab. Well, when they made it, they KNEW it wasn't crab! It is good for vegetarians, those with zucchini-filled gardens, as well as for transplanted Marylanders, who cannot get the real thing. Plus--it tastes good! No other excuse for making it is needed.",These are fantastic! I've served them as a main course as well as making them smaller and serving as appetizers. I don't use any butter and don't miss it. I do put salt on the grated zucchini and after letting it sit awhile I press as much as the liquid out as possible. I make them an hour or so ahead of the meal and put them in the fridge to chill. Then I take them out and rather than using flour I use Panko crumbs. They turn out crispy and delicious.,"I have been meaning to try this recipe for years, and am glad I finally did. Had a $12 crab cake sandwich earlier the same day that wasn't half as good as these were. Do as others have recommended; increase Old Bay, add garlic of some sort, and salt and squeeze your zucchini. We followed the recipe and fried them this time. Served with a remoulade-ish sauce. Much heartier than expected and very inexpensive.","I'm glad I read comments from other reviewers before making this! I also made sure to drain all of the liquid from the zucchini before adding the other ingredients. I fiddled with the original recipe a little. I added 1 potato, shredded, as well as some additional Old Bay. Freshly ground pepper seemed to really give it some ""oomph."" I found that the addition of instant potato flakes (about 1/4 c.) really helped keep it from being too soggy. I dusted with Japanese panko to coat the outside. They were really good this way. I'd make it again!","Oh wow, absolutely the best Vegetarian recipe I've cooked so far. I will use this recipe again. I baked them at 400 for about 15 minutes, then 400 on the other side for 15 minutes.I then turned the oven on broil, browned them a bit,then flipped them over,and browned them.I used 2 teaspoons of Bay's in the mix,and squeezed the Zuchinni several times before baking. I used Italian bread crumbs.Broiling them totally makes them appear fried.","Hey guys, make sure you are using SEASONED bread crumbs. It doesn't say that in the ingredient list, but does say it in the directions. With this it turns out AMAZING!!!","great! change the spices for different taste. add fresh ginger, cilantro, cumin, and garam masala for zucchini samosas. or try cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar for zucchini ""cookies"", my kids love them. i bake with a spray of pam on each side.","YUMMO!!! I'm making these for the 2nd time this week at the request of my husband. I found this recipe when I was looking for ways to use the massive amount of zucchini growing in my garden, and this is surely a hit. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and salted the zucchini and let it sit in a colander for 30-45 minutes after shredding it in the food processor. I added a bit of crushed garlic and increased the old bay a bit. I also used packaged seasoned bread crumbs, and the consistency was perfect. I skipped the flour altogether and baked the cakes. I sprayed a foil lined baking sheet with butter flavored cooking spray, and then sprayed the tops of the cakes too. The first time I cooked them at 400 degrees along with a roasting chicken and 15 minutes per side was perfect. However, this time they are in the oven alone and they stuck a bit, so I will reduce the heat/time next time around. Although these won't replace crab cakes for us (we're big seafood eaters), these zucchini cakes have certainly earned a place on my Meatless Monday rotation.","I thought there were very good, I actually added two cans of drained crab meat and you do not need a whole cup of breadcrumbs to make them stick together..Will def make again","Really good and you would never know it wasn't a crab cake - except it needs more Old Bay Seasoning. I used canola oil so as not to add other flavors, kept my gas flame closer to medium so they would get done through. After putting cocktail sauce on it, you would not know the difference, except for needing more Old Bay. My husband loves this recipe and since he grows an abundance of zucchini and loves the stuff. I have a real winner here! Good job! 4 stars because of the seasoning. I might add a bit of salt and pepper too...",These tasted very good! the zucchini DEFINITELY needs to be drained first! i am SO glad i read the reviews that suggested to do that! I shredded them and salted them and put them in a colander for about an hour and then pressed with a wooden spoon...got almost a CUP of water! I fried half of them and baked the other half. we definitely preferred the baked ones. will for sure make again though!,"Very tasty for a vegitarian dish. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and baked these on a greased baking sheet for 12 mins on each side and they turned out very well (sometimes you do have to make small compromise to taste for health!) My husband who only eats Kosher and has never tasted crab loved them and even my 2 year old gobbled them up and said ""more?"" I used Italian breadcrumbs because that was what I had on hand and served with mayo with fresh chopped parsely mixed in. Next time I might up the Old Bay Seasoning by 1/2 teaspoon.","Easy, satisfying recipe. I doubled the Old Bay, used panko instead of traditional bread crumbs and salted/pressed the zucchini before making the patties. I tried both the baking as another reviewer suggested (400* for 12 min, flipping, bake another 10 min) and frying as written-- there's no comparison. If you're going to eat something breaded, you might as well fry it and enjoy it as it's meant to be. :)","This is a great recipe. The really do taste like crab. While I liked them alot, I think the smooth texture the flour dredge gives them is not as nice as a bread-crumb dredge... but that's just my opinion! They were still great!!!",,,,,,,,
195,"I'm in love with this. I made it last night and let it sit in the fridge for a day, that may have helped. Tonight I warmed some Turkish flatbread in the oven, spread the chickpea filling on it generously, threw some halved cherry tomatoes and thin slices of cucumber on and drizzled with a bit of light yoghurt. Then wrapped it all up burrito-style. After the first bite I thought it was a nice 4 star spread, but it kept tasting better and better with each bite. Now I am finding it hard no to attack the leftovers with a spoon and eat up the whole lot. So good. Wonderful texture, the dill works great (esecially with the salad and yoghurt) and its so healthy. Fingerlicking good. Thanks.","WOW!!! This was fantastic!!! I am so glad I finally tried this recipe, because it was perfect for a light summer dinner. I omitted the celery (personal preference) and used less onions. I used fat free mayo, no sugar added relish, and the dill weed and lemon were perfect!! mashing the chickpeas took some time (I tried using a mixer... not the best idea. There were chickpeas firing everywhere!) but it was all well worth it! We used it to fill pitas, along with romaine and tomato slices. Thanks so much for the great recipe!! With 3 vegetarians and 3 non-veg, we all agreeded it was simply amazing!!! My Grandmother didn't even realize it wasn't tuna!","WOW is the only word that describes this sandwich. This was delicious. It was so good that I was eating it straight out of the bowl. I served this filling on a toasted whole wheat pita with lettuce and tomato. To keep the chick peas moist, just add a few TB of the liquid in the can along with your mayonnaise. Mine was very moist by doing this. Thank you for offering this healthy alternative.","This was pretty good. I did add one large chopped garlic dill, a teaspoon garlic powder and one chopped organic hard boiled egg. I did not use the whole onion, just a few green onions. My littlest loved this, too, believe it or not. I was shocked. I spread his on Dave's Killer Bread but I had mine spread on cucumber slices. NOTE: I used olive oil mayonnaise and I did need an extra tablespoon. Next time, I might add a little dijon and a few shakes Frank's Hot Sauce. I also used organic garbanzo beans.","Heather, this was SO good! Threw the beans into my food processor, added a tad more lemon and lots of garlic. I sliced whole wheat pitas into triangles, baked them in the oven until nice and crispy and used them as a dipping device for the wonderful bean mixture! Incredible and thank you!","Super healthful and a great alternative to tuna fish or egg salad. I served it with leaves of romaine lettuce and tomato, to make lettuce wraps. I thought the lemon juice was a bit overpowering, next time I might halve it. I will also add some chopped carrot and garlic powder and maybe sub green onion for regular onion, just for more color.",This is pretty tasty for someone who eats hummus almost every single day. Seriously. I added lots of garlic and about a half cup of salsa. Tasty!!,My husband and I really enjoyed this. We are always looking for healthy low-fat alternatives. I added some non-fat sour cream to make it more spreadable. It was good on a pita with some crunchy dill pickles. Thanks Heather,"This is a wonderful substitute for peanut butter! I keep some in the fridge for a quick snack to spread on crackers, veggies or bread!",We are not vegetarians but were looking for something differant. We enjoyed this filling on homemade chapatti. I used a food processor but think it will be much better with a chunky texture.,This was so good!!! I was hesitant to try it because of the simple ingredients but I am glad I did! Will make often! I used like 1/4 onion instead of half and left out the pepper. I also cut the onion and celery in very small pieces so it could blend well.,"Boy, who would have ever thought to do this with chickpeas?? This stuff is the bomb!! We love it. We ate it on crackers. Fishlove, you've got a winner here! Thanks for sharing it:)",So yummy and so simple!! Makes a great substitute for chicken salad!,"Very easy to make, but I was a bit hesitant about putting in the beans as is without cooking them to soften them. I still made as is to see how they'd turn out, and as I expected, they were extremely hard to digest. The beans were still a bit hard and as another reviewer said, they really do give you a tummy ache for a few days! I never use canned beans without first boiling them for a few minutes after rinsing, and I will never try to do so again! So...if we were to boil the beans for about 10 minutes before mixing with the rest, this would be a 5 star filling. The flavours were really good, and I would play aroud with the spices each time. Good change on regular tuna sandwitches. We could not eat the leftovers due to their uncomfortable crunchiness, so I ended up putting the mix in a skilled with some water and cooked them until soft, and added some eggs to them to make a nice omelet the next day. That was delicious!","I added a lot to this recipe.. added 1 tsp mustard, 1 extra T mayo, 1/2t curry powder, 2T organic sweet relish, and a pinch of paprika. Also added some raisins. Was absolutely AMAZING. Served on toasted whole-wheat bread, but would be excellent on pita bread. UPDATE: After sitting in the fridge for a couple of days, it tastes even BETTER.","This was great, although I had to make a few changes. I squeezed I half fresh lemon and put 4tbsp of light mayo to make it a little more moist. I also added some garlic powder....it came out totally yummers!",I love this. It's easy to make and super convenient. It stores well in the fridge and making a big batch means I'll have healthy sandwiches to take to class with me all week.,"The raw onion in this recipe is way super overpowering, but otherwise this would be pretty good. So I give it three stars as written, but there is potential.",Really not good-tasting...no one liked this at my house.,Yum! I'm always looking for different ways to use chickpeas. This is a great recipe! Thanks for sharing.,This can be very addictive the celery gives it a nice crunch and the dill makes it so don't leave it out thanks for posting these tasty morsels,"Love it~ I am on a chickpea bender and this was just perfect! I agree with another commentor that this just gets better as it sits.....leave it regrigerated overnite if you can. Did mine with red onion, celery, red pepper, mayo, dijon and lemon. Ate it on a pita bread and YUMMO!","Although this recipe looked good and I will try another time, I was in the mood for something more greek. I used this recipe as a base recipe. To the mashed chick peas I added purple onion, minced garlic, celery, red pepper, lemon juice, mayonaise, seas. salt, pepper, greek seasoning (also found on this site) and some greek salad dressing to get the right consistency. I let the mixture sit in frig overnite for the the flavors to blend. Put this mixure in a pita with some romaine and feta cheese and it was a wonderful tasting meal. I used a pastry blender to cut up the chick peas and it worked very well. Will try tzatziki sauce instead of mayo next time and some black olives as well!!!","I really loved this. Used a potato masher instead of a fork to mash the chickpeas. I did use fresh dill, and less lemon and I didn't use any onion, personal preference. Quick and easy!","I thought this was fantastic, and it has endless options for variety. I used green onions and just threw in a handful..probably 2 or 3 tablespoons or so. I don't like celery, so I omitted that. And I used Veganaise and added just a dash of soy sauce and a dash of liquid smoke to it and mixed before adding to chickpeas. I pulsed the chickpeas and the green onion in the food processor for a few seconds to get a very coarse chop--my preference for consistency rather than mashed. I also omitted the dill. I served on WW bread with pea shoots and fresh tomato. This will be a regular in my lunch rotation, and I'll definitely be experimenting!","As written, this didn't do it for me. Criticisms others have made of dryness and blandness seem valid. Given that I was looking for something to be able to take to work for lunch I did omit the onion. I tasted a forkful from the food processor bowl and knew that I wouldn't eat this. Rather than throw it, I decided to try and salvage it by doctoring. I added more mayo, more celery, 2 hard boiled eggs, and quite a bit of pickle and some pickle juice. It's much more like a tuna salad this way, but without the fishy tuna flavor that I also try to avoid at work. After all the adjustng, I ended up with something I liked and that I'll probably repeat.",,,,,,,,,,

197,"They ARE the best meatballs, even though I use all beef most of the time. I don't fry, b/c I am too impatient, and the meatballs break up more that way. I scoop them out with a spoon, roll them in my hands, and bake on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet. This way, they brown nicely, excess fat is drained off, and they can go right into sauce, or, in our family, meatball hoagies, along with sauteed onions and peppers. They also freeze very well when baked this way. When I take these to parties, I always get requests for the recipe.","I use beef, pork, and veal, as it is readily available in my supermarket. Also, I bake mine instead of frying them, use parchment paper, 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Then, if I have sauce simmering, I drop them in for the finale, or I freeze them for later use, or to give away to the children.","There is nothing I hate more than to get a mediocre or worse review from people who do not follow the recipe as written, and then judge YOU on it. I followed this to a ""T"" even though my experience as a chef was telling me not to. Too much cheese. Not enough garlic. And ""salt and pepper to taste"" is a personal pet peeve. If you are going to post a recipe, include all the measurements, or be prepared to take your lumps. This recipe is good enough to avoid disaster, but DO NOT FRY. They stick to the pan and melt away when you add them to the gravy(tomato sauce). Instead, bake them for about 35 minutes at 350. Then, put them in the gravy for the last hour or two. Replace half the cheese with more breadcrumbs. Less mess, healthier and easier.","Honestly, I was skeptical using water in a meatball recipe, but it was really great! I scaled to 4 servings, used only beef, 85%, 1/2 cup italian style breadcrumbs and Kraft parmesan cheese, as my young children do not yet appreciate the stronger flavor of ""real"" cheese, and they both said they were the best meatballs ever. Also, I did not fry them, to cut down on fat and clean-up, and they kept their shape just fine. I just put them in the gravy and cooked them on simmer for 30 minutes. The sauce was a simple marinara, just sautee 2 cloves of garlic, add 3 cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 can paste, 3/4 c. water and simmer. Add 1T oregano, 1t. basil, 1t. onion powder, salt and pepper and voila! Geanine and I teamed up to make an awesome dinner! Thanks Geanine!","This IS the best Italian Meatball recipe ever. My ex-mother-in-law gave me this recipe more than 25 years ago. We use italian style breadcrumbs and much less liquid (about 1/4 cup milk). What makes it so good is the ratio of meats. You can adjust the flavorings to suit your family's taste. Once browned, the meatballs can finish cooking in the frypan or by baking, or even add them to the sauce. I would recommend this basic recipe to anyone. Excellent addition to Allrecipes.com.","Thank you Geanine! My husband told me that these were absolutely the best meatballs he had ever tried! I didn't pan fry them in olive oil - I simply dropped them into a crockpot full of homemade spaghetti sauce and let them cook with the sauce all afternoon. Also, I used italian style bread crumbs instead of making my own - just used a third cup less. My husband absconded with the leftovers to take to work this morning, and three people from his office called me today to get the recipe! Will ALWAYS use this recipe for spaghetti and meatballs!","Wow, This is the way that I make my meatballs (recipe from my Mom, not some cookbook), but instead of using water, we use milk, and soak the bread in it, and also skip the olive oil browning, as the meat produces enough fat for the browning proceedure. Thanks Geanine!","Exactly the way I make them, except I don't use quite as much water and I don't fry them. I drop them in the sauce to cook. Makes the sauce taste awesome.","Good, standard recipe. For a variation, try using ground italian sausage in place of the pork, along with some minced onion. I also add anise seed to both the meatballs and my sauce. The anise seed really makes it.","These definitely are some of ""The Best Meatballs""! Using three types of meat really makes a difference and a good rule of thumb to ensure moistness is one egg for every one pound of meat. These were delicious - so good you almost could eat them by themselves, but even better when accompanied by an equally good spaghetti sauce. I used a compination of Parmesan and Romano cheeses. I put the Italian bread into my mini food processor and gave it a whirl to produce bread crumbs. Instead of water I used milk and only enough for the meatballs to hold their shape. You don't want these to be mushy or falling apart. I didn't use the olive oil to fry them in a pan but instead I put these into a baking dish and baked at 350 for 20-25 minutes. These were very moist and full of flavor -excellent recipe!","I have my own ""best meatballs"" but every now and then I like to try something different. What I particularly liked about this recipe was the combination of three meats, the addition of Romano cheese (Parmesan would work equally as well), and the fact that it's not loaded up with commercial ""Italian Seasoning."" But I did back off on the cheese to 1/2 cup and added twice as much garlic - I think the amount of cheese called for is far too much. I also used milk rather than water, just enough for the bread to absorb, then squeezed it dry. I didn't want the mess of frying, so I took the easy way out and baked them on a large cookie sheet at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes. At that point I tossed them in the Crock-pot with some of my homemade tomato sauce and let it all marry for several hours. This made a LOT of meatballs for Hubs and me, and was just what I had in mind for easy meals for the next couple of nights while we take care of last minute packing and preparations for our return to Italy! There was even enough to give a good amount to Mom! While I'll always be partial to ""my own"" way of making meatballs (actually Grandma's and Mom's meatballs I grew up on), this was a pretty darned good meatball (backing off on the cheese), with just a few simple ingredients.","I don't rate the recipes from this site. I make them, like them or don't like them, and move on. This will be my first review. Here it goes: I've been through lots and lots of meatball recipes. This is THEE BEST one. EVER. Hands down. Lock up shop!","I first reviewed this in Dec. of 2011. I don't mind people posting recipes that belong to someone else but come on, give them credit. I'm sure Rao's Restaurant in Harlem could care less, but I've read every post since then and you never did give the proper credit. In my book, that kind of makes you a thief!! Live with it.","For the last 25 yrs I have used my Italian mother-in-law's meatball recipe (and they are good) but these are great!! I told her about them and will bring some over Sunday for her to try. A little tip; I fry a tiny meatball to taste for seasoning before I cook the whole batch. Then you can add more cheese, salt, garlic, etc. Great recipe!!","Like others, I baked my meatballs. I made mine a little smaller than a tennis ball. I baked them on a cookie rake with a foil-lined cookie sheet underneath for 25 minutes at 375 degrees. Instead of the called for water, I used 1/2 c. water, and 1/2 cup milk and substituted 1 c italian bread crumbs. My family LOVED these!!","I only gave this four stars because I feel the olive oil and the water are so unnecessary. If you are using ground pork in your meatballs, trust me, there will be plenty of grease to keep them moist and delicious. No need whatsoever to add additional oils. And the water? That I truly don't understand at all. I make these without either the oil or water and they are super moist and extremely delicious!! Without those two unnecessary ingredients, and the addition of basil this easily goes to five stars and above!! Oh, I also do not fry my meatballs. I use a cookie scoop to make them a uniform size and drop them onto a cookie sheet lined with no stick foil (for super easy cleanup and easy removal from thee pan). I bake them for 40 minutes at 350 degrees F. Then I add some to my sauce and freeze the rest for another day, another meal. These are GREAT for meatball sandwiches!!","This meatball recipe is great! I just made them this evening for dinner and they came out great...I changed a couple of things, but it still came out great! I used ground beef only. I substituted italian style breadcrumbs for the bread as Michelle suggested in her review, and I added some italian seasoning as well as parsley and basil to the meat mixture, I found no need for the water and the oil, so I omitted the water and the oil. I find that baking meatballs is so much better and healthier than frying, and they seem to keep their shape better also. The trick to this is, not to over bake them because they can dry out quickly if you don't keep an eye on them so I just use my timer on the oven and it works great, but don't cook them for more than 30 mins in the over. I put a very light coat of oil on a glass pan, you can also use cooking spray as well. I cooked the meatballs on 350 for 20 minutes while I was preparing the sauce and then added a few extra minutes to complete the sauce. As soon as, I got the sauce started I put the meatballs in right away and simmered them with the sauce for about an hour, every thing came out great! Maybe it depends on the size of the meatballs also, but I made mine the size of golf balls, if they cook for only 30 mins they're more than likely not going to be cooked all the way through, but they will finish cooking with the sauce simmering for about an hour, plus some of the fat from the meat will give the sauce lots of flavor!",This recipe is from Rao's Restaurant in Harlem NY. Only difference is less water and more garlic; Google it for yourself. How can you take credit for someone else’s recipe?,"I tried this recipe the first time 3 weeks ago when I had compny over and I loved it. So did everybody else, so much so I was asked to bring them to a dinner party. Again they were a hit. I use Merlot in place of water, takes it to a different level, enjoy!","OMG!!! These are the BEST meatballs I have ever had! And we make meatballs on a regular basis since my family is from Europe! But these are better than ever! I used Parmesan cheese instead (I had that in the freeze) since I have kids, and followed the recipe to the dot!!!! Hubby and kids just devour them too quickly! I made 2 batches, and froze 1 batch! Oh and I baked them in the oven instead of frying them: 45 min. on 450 F. Heavenly! THANK YOU for the recipe!!! It's a keeper!!! ;)",I used beef and pork. Delicious. Thanks,"I cut this recipe by half. I totally agree with the recipe submitter. Using fresh bread crumbs and fresh cheese is totally key. I did add about a teaspoon of homemade italian seasoning and now that I think about it, I totally spaced the egg but you know, I didn't even notice it was gone. I did not fry mine, I used a cookie scoop to make even balls and lined them up in my biggest baking dish and baked them at 350* for 30 minutes. The outcome was wonderful, I could just pour off the grease and add to my marinara. One of the tenderest, flavorful meatballs I've ever had made even better when paired with a homemade marinara. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Geanine!","Frying is time consuming, but it's great to know I could also bake them at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes if I find myself without the time to fry, roll, fry, roll, fry, roll, drain... The cheese and seasoned bread crumbs taste great. I couldn't find ground veal or pork at my supermarket, so I used a pound of Italian sausage in its place... tasted great!","Have been preparing meatballs this way for years, only exception is, I add basil, oregano, 1 egg per pound of meat and milk for the liquid. I use to fry, but have changed over to baking them first before adding to my sauce.......they also freeze well after baking for use at a later time without losing their flavor......ME",I followed this recipe to a T and it came out perfect. It tastes exactly like my mothers recipe. My husband goes nuts for this. Definitely a keeper.,"This was my first attempt at meatballs and they came out great! I only had about 1 1/2 lb of 80/20 ground beef, so I tweaked the recipe accordingly. I still used 2 cloves of garlic, 2 eggs, regular dried parsley, and equal parts salt and pepper. I kind of tossed in around 1/2-3/4 cup grated cheese, around 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs, and about 1/2 cup olive oil. I didn't add any water to the mix since it was perfect as is and I fried the meatballs in olive oil until browned. I then added them to my sauce and let them simmer for about an hour. They were some of the best meatballs I've ever had! This is definitely a great base meatball recipe!",,,,,,,,,,
198,"My boyfriend LOVES this recipe. If the sauce is too greasy, I put the sauce in a container in the freezer while I'm shredding the beef. The grease hardens on top, and you can skim it off. Then you can return it to the slow cooker with the shredded beef. Excellent!!!","Excellent. I made this just as indicated, except to avoid the fattiness people mentioned, I trimmed the excess fat off before cooking and then cooked it for a couple of hours without the sauce, drained the grease off, then added the sauce and finished cooking it for another 6 or 7 hours. Definately be making again.","Fantastic! Don't like the way my crockpot cooks things so I put it in the oven... 350 for an hour, reduced heat to 225 and left it for 3 hours. Shredded it, and put it back in for another hour. Came out PERFECT! Thanks!","Wow! This was soooo easy to make and absolutely delicious! I used a pork roast instead of a beef roast and it turned out fabulous! I shredded the meat and served it on toasted sesame seed buns with a dollop of coleslaw on top ~ YUMMY! The only thing I'd do different next time is cut the vinegar down to about 1/8 cup, as it had a stronger vinegar taste than I prefer, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing! My husband and I both loved this and I'll definitely be making it again real soon! Thanks for a truly delicious barbecue recipe, Corwynn! :)","I have made this dish using a beef chuck roast twice and a pork loin roast 3 times. I personally like the pork better, but my family likes them both. I serve on buns or over rice w/ a salad. I usually reduce the vinegar just a bit for family preference. Also, I trim the meat thorougly before cooking to eliminate fat in the BBQ sauce. I tried the suggestion of making a second batch of BBQ sauce once, but found that I had trimmed the meat enough to eliminate most fat. Plus, I liked the flavor of the BBQ sauce that had been cooking all day with the meat. This dish is great for parties, family events, etc. This recipe is a keeper!","My family loved this dish! Even my daughter who never tries anything liked it. Some other reviewers mentioned that the sauce had too much fat in it after cooking so long so I just cut my roast into chunks and cut off all the fat before I put it in the crock pot. There was hardly any fat in the sauce when it was done, and it cut down on the cooking time. It was great!","This recipe was great. I used some BBQ sauce, some ketchup and no liquid smoke and it was fine. If there's one piece of previous advice I would definitely say to take is to cut the meat into chunks and get rid of all the fat you can. I did this and my sauce wasn't greasy at all.","I believe the ketchup mixture helped to keep the beef moist, however, I would not use this as a sauce to serve over the shredded meat, it ended up tasting like ketchup, and nothing else. So, I discarded the ketchup mixture and then added a bottle of McClard's barbeque sauce and can of green chilies and it was wonderful!","Chuck roasts are well known to have a fair bit of fat. If you cook the roast without all of the sauce you can remove the fat & oil, shred the meat and THEN add the sauce. It tastes just as good, you don't get the black burned sauce ring around your crock pot & this way you cut down on the calories and don't bite into a big chunk of fat...yuck.",YUM!!! I doubled the sauce and added it all to the pot. This was very good. You definitely need to shred the beef though. I didn't feel like taking the time to do that but then found myself doing it anyway on my plate. The sauce is excellent! I'll definitely make this again.,"This is EXCELLENT!! I browned the roast prior to placing in the crock pot. Also, I was pressed for time, so I cooked it on high for about 5 hours. Turned out perfectly moist and tender. I only added a few things that I thought would compliment it- 1 cup of diced sweet onion, 1 cup diced green pepper, 1/2 cup dark molasases, and about 2 tablespoons of beef boulion. One review stated the sauce was too thin, but after you shread the 4lbs of beef and add it back to the pot, turn it to high with the lid off for the final hour. This will help the sauce thicken. I served this on toasted buns, with Resturant style cole slaw II from this site. This was even better the next day!",I love this recipe! I use it often to make brisket sandwiches! YUMMY!! I don't change anything :),This recipe is a winner! I did a few things differnt and it turned out perfect. First of all I didn't add any vinegar and I added a little more brown sugar because I do like a sweeter barbecue sauce. Second I just brushed the meat with the sauce and set the rest aside until the meat was done. Once the meat was done I drained off all the extra juice and shredded the meat and then added the rest of the sauce and it turned out perfect.Thanks for sharing this recipe!,"This is really outstanding. I made a big pot of it for my fellow actors between performances, and they ate so much they could barely perform the next show! I cooked the meat the day before, and as someone suggested, put the sauce in the refrigerator for awhile, which allowed the fat to harden on top. It was then easily removed. I found the sauce to be a little runny, plus I had mistakenly used mesquite flavored smoke instead of hickory, which I prefer. So, I too made an extra batch of sauce, and ended up combining it with the sauce the meat was cooked in. I put enough in the crock pot to coat the shredded meat, and served the rest on the side. It was truly excellent. I can't imagine throwing out the first batch of sauce, it had so much flavor from the meat. It just needed a little boost. Thanks!","This recipe works better if you cook the meat first, drain off the excess grease, shred the meat, then add the BBQ sauce and cook longer. Otherwise, the grease and meat juices mask the flavor of the BBQ sauce. The first time I made the sauce, it was absolutely delicious. The second time, it tasted too much like vinegar. The only difference was the second time I used a new bottle of Holland House brand vinegar, so maybe it depends on the brand and age of the vinegar. I would suggest using only half the amount of vinegar and adding more, if needed, after everything is mixed together. I also increased the salt to 1 teaspoon and the pepper to over half a teaspoon because I thought it was a little bland.","This was fantastic! I followed the directions for the most part. I used a Beef round bottom roast and added 1 chopped onion and 1 diced green pepper which added lots of flavor. I didn't have that smoked sause. I also cut the meat into bite size cubes before I added it into the crock pot. The cubes came out extremely tender and pulled apart as well. If you take the lid off for the last two hours of cooking, you will find that the sause thickens and you don't need to make extra sause like others have said. Mine turned out perfect. I served this dish over rice for my children and my husband and I ate it on a Kieser roll. Please try!","After shredding the beef I decided to try the sauce. It makes a great base, but I felt like it needed a little something more... I added chili powder, pepper, salt, onion powder and garlic salt. MMMMM!!!! Every one loved it! After shredding it I took the lid off and it helped the sauce to thicken.","Thought this was Delish!!! I made it to the ""T"". I mean how else can you rate it otherwise. I didnt have any problem with to much sauce. I cooked it for 10 hours on low in my crock and it had what I thought was perfect amount of sauce. Yes, on the thin side, but once you started shreading the beef it started to blend in. My daughter (7) who does not like to much beef (we made this for my son who does","Made this for tonights dinner, it was yummy! The entire family liked it. Some of us had it over rice, some had it on a bun and my youngest had it by itself. The sauce is a little greasy, but as my husband said, it's BBQ, it's supposed to be greasy. Actually, I fixed it by laying a couple slices of bread on top of the sauce when I had the meat out. It soaks the grease right up, then just toss 'em. I save the loaf heels for this.","Based on all the rave reviews for this recipe, I made it 2 days before my husbands b-day party. Because I needed a double amount I made one batch with beef and one with pork. I made the sauce as written but added about a cup of bottled BBQ sauce to each batch as I warmed the meat up in the crock pot the day of the party. What a success! Everyone loved BOTH versions. I couldn't get anyone to rate one meat better then the other! My husband said it was the best BBQ sandwich he'd ever had, and my neighbor said he had cravings for it later that evening! It's a keeper!","I used a 2lb. roast, but did not decrease the sauce ingredients. I added some cayanne for heat. I cooked it for 6 hours before shredding it. Yummy","So easy and delicious - the meat was tender and the sauce perfect! I followed the suggestion of making a second batch of sauce - the original cooking sauce was much too greasy for me. I simmered it on the stove about 15 minutes to thicken, before adding it back to the crockpot with the shredded beef. Next time I will try this with a pork roast - yummmmmm!","Good base recipe. Definitely double the sauce. I also added far more seasonings than this called for (extra mustard, and little honey, cumin, and some Tabasco sauce). I also drained off the fat and added some corn starch at the end. 6-7 hours is plenty of time for this to cook.","Man-o-man was this good. It will knock your socks off. I scaled it down to serve six, used a 2 lb eye of round roast (no grease to worry about) and 1/2 cup chili sauce and 1/4 cup ketchup. Also, after I added the beef back to the crock, I also added another serving of the barbecue sauce so it would really juicy. I also made another batch of sauce and heated it on the stove to serve with the sandwich. Served it with corn, carrots and followed it up with watermelon for dessert. It was great. I highly recommend this recipe.","It was good, but did not taste like BBQ. Was a tad vinagery.","If you're really hard up for something barbecue-ish and different, give it a shot. I didn't like it much and neither did my husband. The sauce is hard to describe...it's sweet but has a kick. I just did not like it, but I am a barbecue lover so to be fair maybe I should've known this wouldn't cut it for my family.","Awesome recipe!! My 'BBQ Master' Husband went crazy for this recipe. I had to substitute Peach balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar and I didn't add the liquid smoke, but did use a Hawaiian smoky seasoning salt we have. It was delicious!!! :)",,,,,,,,,
199,"This was VERY good! I made some changes, here is exactly what I did: I grated 4 baby carrots and about half of a yellow onion into the bowl using a large microplane. I soaked the 1 cup of breadcrumbs in the 1 cup of milk while I was grating the veggies. This last step plumps up the bread so that it's nice and moist all through the mixture, and then I just add this mushy mixture to the meatloaf. Also, I grated the colby cheese fresh instead of using pre-grated since I find it melts better this way. As the recipe stated, after using my hands to mix the meatloaf, I FOLDED the cheese in using a spoonula as if making a mousse. I added a few splashes of worcestershire sauce to the mix, and then I formed TWO loaves in a 9x13 baking dish. Covered each loaf with a thin layer of my favorite bottled BBQ sauce, and used a thermometer to alert me when they had reached 175 degrees, took them out of the oven and covered with foil for a couple of minutes. Delicious! I love this served with oven-roasted potatoes or mashed potatoes, and 'Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad' from this website. ***UPDATE: according to the USDA website (and other websites as well), ground turkey must be cooked to 165 degrees. So, I remove this meatloaf from the oven when it registers between 155 and 160, and then cover tightly with foil so it comes up to temp. ALWAYS moist, never dry.","This recipe is great and super quick!! I added much more seasoning to the ground turkey vs. just the S&P the recipes calls for - such as, grated onion, garlic, worchestire, seasoning salt. I also used shredded cheddar instead of cubed colby because that is what I had on hand. Also, try BBQ sauce on the top instead of the traditional ketchup. I mixed all the ingredients earlier in the day while my son was sleeping and let it sit in the fridge. Then I just slipped it in the oven. I think that really helped meld the flavors together. I would definitely make this again.","The flavor on this meatloaf was 5 stars, even my picky kids asked for seconds. I had to give it a 4 for CATCHING MY OVEN ON FIRE. I was a bit skeptical about the cheese being in cubes, but after the great reviews I figured I was over reacting. Even so I made my cubes smaller. 20 minutes into cooking cheese bubbled out the pan, onto the heating element and caught fire. I put a tray under it and continued cooking. It was great flavor. From now on I will shred my cheese as I usually do. I also shredded on small zucchini and a small carrot and added them to the mix since I was a bit short pundage wise on the turkey. (This was also a great way to gets some veggies into the kids!) Great recipe,just please shred your cheese!","Very cheesy, very easy to make. It was almost reminded me of a giant cheeseburger. I did use cubed cheese as recommended & I loved how the cheese was throughout the meatloaf in yummy ""globs"" of cheesiness... :-)I cut the portion down to 4 servings using 1 lb. of ground turkey. I also added about 3 tbs. of smoky BBQ sauce to the mixture, 2 tbs. of dried parsley, & about 3 tbs. of chopped vidalia onion. Next time I will add more onion. It was done cooking in about 57 minutes and was extremely moist. I thought that the smoky BBQ sauce really added a needed flavor. I thought it was great & will definitely make again.","This recipe is easy and tasty - what more could you want? My father is a raving fan of beef, but he asks me to make this for him all the time - a high compliment from him. The only changes I made to it were to soak the breadcrumbs in the milk for 5 minutes (as another reviewer suggested) before combining with the turkey (which I'm certain makes a huge difference), using shredded cheese instead of cubed, and adding Worcestershire sauce to the ground turkey when mixing through, as it adds a fullness to the flavour of the meatloaf. Sometimes I also caramelise some finely chopped onions and add them to the turkey mix as well, and it's lovely. Like I said, this recipe's good - so good, I've been asked to make it tonight (this'll be the third time at least!).","This is by far the best meatloaf recipe I have ever tried. It's so moist and delicious with all that cheese. I do like a little more spice, however, so I added some A-1 steak sauce, garlic powder, and dried minced onions to the meat mixture and let it sit for an hour before I made the loaf. The result was heavenly. A word of caution: make sure you have a drip pan underneath or you'll have a huge mess because some of the cheese will ooze out of the pan. Temporarily turning off your smoke alarm and using a meat thermometer is also recommended.",I have honestly hated meatloaf just about as long as I've been alive. Until THIS recipe came along!!! This is the most AMAZING meatloaf I've ever had. My only changes; I used shredded cheese instead (all I had on hand) and added a little bit of onion soup mix. So good. Thank you!,"This was really good and simple! I halved the recipe, except added all of the shredded cheese. I used seasoning salt instead of plain salt, a dash of worcestshire sauce, and mixed the ketchup right into it. We LOVED it, including my husband who isn't a fan of ground turkey. He even ate the leftovers on a sandwich later! Thanks!","My son really wanted to make this. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor. But we did add a package of onion soup mix. I think it would be pretty tasteless without it. Mine took about an 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach the proper temperature. And like others have said, it bubbles over and makes a nightmare out of the oven.","It was good, but I found it to be a little flavorless. I needed to eat it with a lot of ketchup , I would find a way to tweak it to add more flavor next time!","I LOVE meatloaf. Could not get my family to ever eat it so I went without for years until this recipe. I much prefer turkey over the gr beef. I did make changes because there are so many ideas. I used 1lb of good gr. turkey..next time i will use 2lb. 1 egg some garlic powder, montery steak seasoning, sea salt and wort sauce (sorry cant spell wortschire right) In meantime sauted a mixture of finely chopped onion and garlic in olive oil. Added white sliced mushrooms to the onion mixture with garlic salt and a nice drop of red wine. Poured half the mushroom onion mixture to the turkey meat and about 1 cup panko bread crumbs. Mix well spread half the meat mixture in a glass baking dish. Layered fresh baby spinach leaves, the rest of the onion mushroom mixture and about 3 slices of pepper jack cheese. ThenI spread the rest of the turkey mixture on top and sealed edges. Baked or 3o and added a glaze of ketchup, mustard and wort sauce and baked for another 3o at 350. served with mashed potatoes. No veg needed cuz the spinach and mushrooms are baked in the turkey loaf. This is the best ever. Thank you for sharing.","Made this twice already, and each time it's been a great hit with my family. My brothers, the big red meat-eaters, always ask for seconds... and thirds. :) The flavor was fabulous and the cheese just adds to the overall deliciousness! I did add a little more S&P the second time around, and it was that much better! :) This is another recipe that will be continued in my house. Thank you for sharing!","This is a really great basic meat loaf recipe. I have used my own mexican meat loaf recipe for years but was looking for something specific to do with ground turkey & ran across this one. I did make a few changes but not anything that totally changes it. I used grated cheese, my own unflavored bread crumbs ( I put heels in a freezer bag to keep for this purpose) which I also soaked in the milk. I also added in about 1 c of a frozen onion,green pepper & celery blend & some Worchestershire & garlic salt. I topped it w/ Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce & my family polished off the entire thing! I had 3 lbs of meat so I adjusted the recipe & made 2 loafs one of which I put in the freezer to bake later. We were a little disappointed b/c there weren't any leftovers to make sandwiches with so I may have to pull it out sooner rather than later. All of my adjustments were more for taste than the mechanics of the recipe. Thanks , we love it!","This was amazing!!! I only made minor changes; soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk, added shredded carrot and diced onion. Instead of ketchup, I used bbq sauce (sweet baby rays) it's the best! Oh my goodness!!! I never get seconds especially with something like meatloaf, but I did tonight. GREAT recipe....in my file for good :)",first off i hate turkey and meatloaf. so i wanted to find a way to make it taste really good. mothers on weight watchers so she is obsessed with turkey at the moment. i swear this is the best meatloaf i have ever had. it was so juicy and i actually had cheese crumples in the fridge from a different recipe they worked fabulous! i made 2 meatloaf one with ketchup and the other bbq as the topper. family prefered ketchup i loved,"This turned out really good. I used shredded sharp cheddar and shredded jack because that's what I had, and I tweaked the seasons by adding onion & garlic powder and black pepper. I formed mine into a french bread-shaped loaf and baked it on a sprayed & foil-lined baking sheet - I've found this helps cut down on burning in meatloaves that have sticking potential. I'll try this again some time when I have the cheese to cube. Thanks for the recipe!","WOW. I was skeptical, but made this recipe exactly as listed. I was blown away with the results! The recipe seems light on seasoning compared to other meatloaves I've made, but the Italian bread crumbs and colby cheese add big, wonderful flavor. Even the plain ketchup on top tasted just-right! Quick prep, huge flavor, and enough for leftovers. This is definitely my new favorite meatloaf recipe!","Delicious! The only change I made was to cut the recipes in half because I was only cooking for two, but that was enough to fill a small loaf pan perfectly! It was very moist and flavorful. I will definitely make this again.","I really enjoyed this recipe - and so did my husband :-) I cut the recipe in 1/2 and I used Italian seasoned ground turkey meat since it is what I had in the freezer. Since I had the Italian seasoned turkey I changed the recipe up a little bit - I used grated parmesan cheese and added diced jalapenos as well as fresh garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper, 1/2 oatmeal and 1/2 bread crumbs. I used 1 egg and 1/2 c milk but I found that my loaf was too liquidy - so I added more oatmeal and bread crumbs until the consistency was right. I baked it for 1hr and 15 min and it was perfect! Very very good!! I know that I did make changes to the recipe but I only did so since I did not have plain ground turkey. I will be making this again for sure!!","I'm not a fan of meatloaf, but my husband is...so I tried this. Substituted 1% milk and low fat everything & egg whites. It was FANTASTIC! I'll definitely be making this again!","I use this recipe so often that I am needing to print out another copy because the old one is so tattered! I usually add some sauteed shallots and garlic to the mixture. I also mix some mustard and brown sugar with the ketchup. And, I use shredded cheese instead of cubed cheese.","Excellent! Since the point of making turkey anything is to cut fat and calories I made some changes. Used ground turkey BREAST, eggs, 2% Kraft cheese crumbles, extra skim milk, sauteed onion, garlic clove and celery, fresh bread crumbs, and a packet of low sodium onion soup mix. Eliminated the salt and used some Mrs. Dash and dry parsley. Covered the roasting pan and baked at 375° until the internal temp reached 165°. It was moist and flavorful with a lower calorie and fat count. Thank you for a great recipe! I noticed some people had problems with spillovers in the oven. I used one of those deep speckled enamel roasting pans with a cover, sprayed it with Pam and it was perfect. Easy clean-up with no oven mess.","Wow, this was sooooo good and you'd never even know it was turkey! I used half the cheese and since I don't like ketchup, used worchestershire sauce instead. I just sprinkled it over the top before I put the loaf in the oven. My daughter's only four months old but I'm sure she'll love this when she's old enough!","My family loved this. Even my 6-year-old PICKY son said it was delicious. If he says something is good, then it really must be! I will definitely make it again.","This was the 2nd time I made this and I still had very little of the cheese in the meatloaf and most of it on the bottom of the pan. Not sure what I'm doing wrong here. I halved the recipe, used panko, grated in 1/4 an onion, added 1 clove garlic, a few dashes of worcestershire and a T of parmesan cheese. It was really good, but disappointed about the cheese.",very good thank you for sharing,very good. i put salsa into my mixture then ketchup on top. i also omit the salt. very good.,"Best meatloaf I have ever tasted! The whole family loved it. I soaked the bread crumbs in milk before adding it to the meat mixture and used shredded cheese instead of cubed. Also added garlic powder, onion powder, and a bit of Worcestershire sauce.",,,,,,,,
200,"Probably one of the best pork roast I've ever made. I took a glass baking dish about the size of my roast and spead the dry ingredients in there. I added way more than called for because I like my roast to be crusted on the outside, not burned. I also added garlic salt. Then I rolled my roast in the seasonings. No need to add oil to the roast before coating. I placed the roast in one of those large black roasting pans with a cake rack on the bottom so it would not sit in it's drippings. No need to cover it with foil. I cooked mine for 2 hours & 45 minutes at 325 degrees and it did not burn. I also used a meat thermometer. Definately double the sauce. I combined all my ingredients except for the cornstarch and got it warm first. Then I had a whisk on hand when I added the cornstarch slowly so it wouldn't clump up. If your sauce gets too thick just add a little more vinegar. At 2 1/2 hours I took the roast out and drizzled about 1/2 cup of sauce over the roast. I did not brush it because I didn't want to rub off my seasonings. I put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes and it was perfect. I will use this sauce with other meals. It reminded me of the Chinese BBQ sauce on hula beef.","This was an amazing dish!I used balsamic vinegar, and was a bit worried since the mix of soy sauce and the balsamic looked so dark on the roast, but the flavour was outstanding. I also doubled the spices and garlic, mincing the garlic; added a bit of olive oil to make the rub stick to the roast better. I cut slits in the top of the roast and inserted more garlic slivers, and I also put a tent of foil over the roast for the first 2 hours to keep it moist. The sauce has a bit of a teriyaki taste, and no one I serve this to can seem to get enough of it! Awesome! My husband said to make sure I put the recipe in a ""safe place"" for repeated use! :)","This is an excellent recipe. I normally use a 1 ½ to 2 pound pork tenderloin but I still DOUBLE the herb rub and TRIPLE the sauce. For best results do not substitute for the sage. It makes this recipe. I also use prepared minced garlic out of a jar. Much easier and I think the garlic flavor is better. Not sure were the 3 hour cooking time comes from, but it doesn’t matter. I bake in a convection oven which goes much faster. Simply use a good meat thermometer and take it out at 150 and rest covered with foil for 15 minutes. I cut into small medallions and serve over jasmine rice. Drizzle some extra sauce over the pork and rice before serving.",Can you rate this higher than 5 stars was the question my brother asked when I served this to his family last night. we did double the glaze and used brown sugar and balsamic vinagar as suggested. I also jazzed up the rub a bit by adding onion powder and some garlic powder to the mix as well as the fresh garlic and rubbed sage. We had a 3 lb pork loin and it took about 1 1/2 hours to cook. I use an instant read themometer and it was reading 160 at the thickest part of the roast when I took it out. Don't forget to brush your glaze on during the last bit of cooking! We made gravy from the pan drippings by adding about 1 cup water and corn starch as well as adjusting the flavor with salt and pepper. You will not be disapointed!,"This roast literally fell apart before the 3 hours were up!!! So tender. I used a roaster with a lid. I didn't have a rack to fit so I just cut up an onion in big chunks and placed under the roast. I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki and I also used red wine vinegar instead of the white. I had to stop my husband from devouring the entire roast! **Note from my BH&G Cookbook** Pork cooked with bacon, spinach, tomatoes or onion will sometimes remain pink even when well done so use the meat thermometer to ensure doneness.","delicious! my roast was 2 lb. and took about 1 hr. 45 min. to cook. i used the same amount of seasoning for my small roast, doubled the garlic, and doubled the sauce. i also substituted brown sugar for white, plus a little honey until just the sweetness i liked, and some sesame seeds. the BEST addition i made was to add some sriracha (asian chili sauce) to the sauce, and that seemed to balance it perfectly- sweet, sour, and spicy. our 2 lb. roast was gone in about 15 minutes, with 2 adults and 2 kids. i will make this over and over again!",This was by far the best roast I have ever had! It was soooo juicy and the flavours fit perfectly! I did make some changes though just for my personal taste and for what I had onhand: - added some rosemary to the rub - used 2 tbsp. of flour instead of the 1 tbsp. of cornstarch (Betty Crocker's suggested substitution!) And I let the glaze boil a little longer so it was quite thick- I prefer a really thick glaze as opposed to a runny one! I recommend this recipe to anyone- so easy and SOOOO delicious!,"i'll admit that i was skeptical at first, but it actually turned out great! even my pork-hating husband enjoyed it. a tip for using up the leftover pork & glaze: chop up the pork, throw in a can of pineapple chunks and some chopped green pepper. add the glaze when everything's warm and then serve that mixture over cooked jasmine rice-- so good!","I've cooked this as a roast and as tenderloin. Tenderloin is much better! I used 1lb tenderloin, kept the sauce and herb measurements the same. Changed with brown sugar and balsamic vineger. Cooked 1hr at 325. To die for! Especially over white rice!!!","This recipe is a good template, but has a lot more depth and flavor if you use brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. Also double the water in the sauce. With those adjustments 5 stars",This was super easy to make & really tasted awesome. My husband LOVED it. I actually cooked it in the slow cooker. We loved this dish.,"Wow!!! This takes the place of my former favorite pork tenderloin recipe ""Maple-Garlic Marinated Pork Tenderloin"". I used balsamic vinegar but this is the only substitution I made for the glaze and I'm glad. I also used 2 pork tenderloins (2.5 lbs. total) instead of a pork loin roast which significantly reduces the cooking time. The glaze is absolutely delicious. I cooked it in 9 x 13 pan lined with heavy duty foil. At the end of the cooking time I poured the remainder of the glaze over the meat. Once it was sliced, I returned it to the cooking pan with the glaze to serve. I will make this one again and again. UPDATE: I've made this MANY times and have found that the amount of sugar can be reduced to just a little over 1/4 cup and it is still wonderful.","The rub and sauce are delicious!!! I doubled the rub (except for salt/pepper) and the sauce, and then followed all the recommendation of the most highly rated review. S/he has some good suggestions, like rolling the pork in the rub etc. Spooning instead of brushing the roast with the sauce so as not to rub off the spices... BUT!!! DO NOT put the roast on a rack!!! Pork loin tends to be dry and NEEDS to roast in it's own juices. I have made this twice, the first time I baked it on a rack, and it so SO DRY! the second time I followed the recipe exactly in regard to cooking method and it was AWESOME. Everyone thinks they are a culinary wizard on this site, and many times the tips are great, but I have ruined to many a good recipe following others advice. I will make this again... but ignore what the reviewers have to say on this one!!!!","This was AMAZING! I used a 2lb roast, doubled the rub, added some onion powder, and minced garlic, and doubled the sauce as suggested. I also used a ladle to pour glaze generously over the roast 3-4 times during the last 1/2 hour of cooking, as opposed to brushing it on so as not to lose any of the rubbed seasoning, as suggested in a previous review. After taking the roast out I grabbed about 1/4 cup pf the drippings and added them to the remaining glaze mixture with a cup of water and heated on stove top for about 8-10 minutes for a delicious and light ""gravy"" to use on the potatoes I made as a side. This was SOOOO delicious that my husband and I couldn't stop picking at it the entire night - even when it was cold from the fridge! With the right knife to cut this thin, this meat would make EXCELLENT sandwich meat!!! Definitely a keeper for my family!",So this was the first time i have ever made a pork roast and it turned out amazing. But i did make a few minor changes. First i used a 2lb roast. I doubled the sage (wish i would have tripled)and doubled the sauce. I also added about 2 tbls of minced garlic to the sauce as well. I cut slits in the meat and put garlic in. I rubbed sage on and let sit in the fridge for about an hour. Then i cooked it at 325 for an hour in a 9 X 13 pan covered in tinfoil. then i took off foil and basted every 10 minutes for another 40 minutes. Turned out EXCELLENT. Even had extra sauce for dipping. I highly recommend it.,mmmm yummy! so awsome and easy!! i put the rub on the roast adn poped it in the oven with a tiny bit of water in the pan just to insure moisture... then at 1 hour in... i put a bit of the glaze on it...shoved it back in... at 2 hours... i put more glaze on... and then about every 20 min for the last hour i put some on.... its was fantastic best yet!!! nice and juicy! i was kinda unsure about not covering it...but i gotta tell ya it doesnt need it... just a tiny tiny amount of water in the bottom of the pan to start and it was fine!!!,"Outstanding! Super simple and the entire family, including two preschoolers, absolutely loved it. The sauce is just delish and would be great on chicken or beef, too. I poked holes all over my roast and really covered it in the rub before roasting, then followed the rest of the directions exactly. Since I fixed it for a week night, I cooked it two hours the night before, then finished off the third hour with the sauce prep on the second night and served it. Pretty enough and yummy enough for a company dish. THANKS for a great recipe that will be a family favorite!! (Update - life intervened tonight and I had to serve the pork roast without making the sauce at all. It was still delicious and moist with the meat juices drizzled on top when I plated. This is a no-fail recipe!)","This was very very good, was a little dry, the glaze worked as a good dipping sauce",made it in a crock pot by making extra glaze. used extra glaze as gravy over rice. it was excellent!,"I just finished eating and it was delicious! The glaze is really amazing and it makes the pork not so dry; this is not a boring pork roast, very casual and versatile. I ate with potatoes and green beans, but this a recipe that would also be amazing with fried rice and egg rolls sice it has an teryaki taste to it. I recommend it; cheap and easy if you're a pork roast rookie like me.",Amazing!!! My hubby raved about this! The whole family loved it. The only thing I did different was cook it in a slow cooker for about 8 hours. Put the glaze on with about 3 hours left. Delish!!!,"Everyone at the table gave this 5 stars! I had a 3 1/2 lb roast so I had to shorten the cooking time a little, I used the amount of sage/salt and pepper as per the recipe but I used 3 cloves of garlic in the rub--not sure if the spices would have been enough for a 5lb roast. I also used balsamic vinegar in the glaze and low sodium soy sauce--I doubled the sauce so we would have a little extra to dip in.","I made this for the second time tonight. The first time was for my in-laws. I ended up not having white sugar, so I used brown sugar. It was amazing. They raved about it and I reluctantly shared the recipe!! This time I didn't have plain vinegar, only malt vinegar. Used that, and it was still amazing! Both times I just threw the pork in the crock pot, rubbed seasonings on it, then drizzled the sauce to cover. Let it cook on high for about 6 hours, turning once half-way through.. fall-apart delicious! My picky daughter even loves it!! Don't think I'll ever try a different way to cook a pork roast. This is it!",This pork was GREAT! Very tender and very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. I had a 4.5-lb roast and it took only 2 hours to get to 175 so take note! I would definitely make this again.,I give this 5 stars for two reasons: Ease of preparation and great flavor. This recipe includes staple items and takes hardly any prep at all which is great for a busy mom with 2 toddlers tugging at my legs (literally :-). Tip: I agree that you should double the sauce and pour over after slicing and I used honey instead of sugar per another reviewer-it was great. Oh and I used balsalmic vinegar instead of plain.,Great recipe! I didn't have sage so I used oregano and I used red wine vinegar for the vinegar. It was delicious. Makes a lot though.,"This recipe was a winner!! I had to alter some ingredients based on what I had on hand so I used poultry seasoning in place of sage and ponzu/teriyaki sauces in place of the soy sauce. I also only used a 3 pound roast. I doubled the glaze recipe and added quartered apples in with the pork. I also lined the bottom with sliced onion so the roast could sit on it and cook. Oh, and I cooked it for about 2.5 hours and it was a perfect medium and so tender. It was delicious!!! My toddlers all asked for seconds and thirds and every plate at the table was empty. That NEVER happens! I will definitely be putting this one into the rotation.","This made an exceptionally good meal. I prepared the recipe as-is. I did find that it cooked much faster than anticipated, and seemed that it transitioned from approx 140F to 170F in a matter of minutes. Suffice it to say that I did slightly over-cook the pork loin, but it made no difference in the flavor, and with the extra sauce, was plenty juicy enough. Next time, I will monitor it more closely once it approaches the 140 mark. I would advise preparing extra sauce for the table as it, alone, is a big hit. I added approx 1/4C drippings to the sauce before serving.",I make this at least twice a month. Very good. I do substitute brown sugar for the white and I use apple cider vinegar. I also cut slits all over the roast and insert garlic slivers. I double the seasonings since i like a well seasoned roast. Be careful of the cooking time. I used a smaller roast and it was done in 1.5 hours.,,,,,,,
201,"really easy and yummy! IMPORTANT NOTE: if you want it to taste like true restaurant style, you need to put the rice only in a pot over high heat and stir it around for about 5 minutes or so before cooking. it helps the grains of rice to stay separate (more like restaurant style) and less sticky. i also used frozen peas/carrots from a bag..worked great!","This is a great recipe! The only thing I want to add is that to get that authentic ""taste"" of restaurant fried rice, you should add about half a bottle of Oyster Sauce. Easily found in the asian section at the grocery store. Back off on that much if it tastes too strong, but after years of living in Japan and trying many versions of fried rice recipes, oyster sauce is the ticket!","I found this quite tasty after a few adjustments. I cooked it in beef broth instead of the water and added a little minced garlic, grated ginger, sesame oil and green onions! Just like the restaurant!! Yum!","I like the ingredients, and the finished dish is fine with some cooking method changes. Start with your rice cooked and COLD. Not necessary to cook the peas at all. Don't scramble the eggs with the vegetables -cook them separately in a small saute pan like a crepe. Once cooled, roll the thin egg pancake up like a cigar, then cut it into shreds, chiffonade-style. I also added some chopped green onion and small, cooked shrimp. Small but important preparation changes result in a better, 4-star outcome.","I truly liked this recipe, but I found that it is 100% necessary to prepare the rice a day ahead of time. That extra day is everything to this recipe, in my opinion.","My first attempt ever at fried rice and it was really good. I took the advice of others and used frozen pea's and carrots, I heated the wok and used olive oil sauteed 1/2 onion then added veggies then rice, to be exact I used 1/3 c. soy sauce, and it was plenty for our taste. My husband really liked it and ate nearly half of what I made. Thanks for a great recipe, will make again.","I have learned that I must double or even triple this recipe because everyone who tries it...can't get enough of it! It is better than any restaurant I've ever been to! The only change I have made is to boil the rice in Chicken or Beef broth, it really brings out the flavor! I only use frozen mixed veggies too. Last night I even added a can of Tiny Shrimp. Absolutely Delicious! This is an amazing recipes! Thanx Jostrander!","This is my default fried rice recipe as I like the carrot/pea combo, but any meat/veggie can be added to make it a meal in itself. Usually I use leftover rice, shred the carrots and leave the peas frozen as they thaw rather quickly. For the eggs, I don't scramble them; instead I mix the eggs with a bit of water/pepper/soy then leave them to cook flat in the pan. When cooked through, I roll the circle o' egg up and cut chiffonade-style, adding the shreds to the pan after seasoning the rice and veggies with soy sauce. Any way it's made, it's all good... thanks!",This rice recipe is indeed 'restaurant' style. The sesame oil should be made mandatory rather than being optional. It really gives the impression that you're tasting Chinese fried rice. I will definitely do this recipe again. I may just include chopped mushrooms the next time I'll prepare this dish.,"My family loves this recipe, the only thing I do differently is to cook the rice a day ahead and put it in the fridge until ready to use. This makes the rice less sticky and more ""restaurant style""!",I read other reviews & was hesitant to make this. I did make some modifications. I cooked some fresh chopped shrimp & garlic in the oil before adding the peas & carrots. I also cooked my rice (brown rice) with some beef boullion as someone else had suggested. This was great! I will make this often.,"I made some minor changes based on the reviews and it turned out fabulous! I made the rice ahead of time and allowed it to chill in the refrigerator. I used frozen mixed vegetables. I did not boil these but simply rinsed under cold water, drained and then stir fried them with about 3 cloves of minced garlic and about a teaspoon of minced ginger before adding in the rice. I beat the eggs slightly and then in a separate fry pan cooked them without scrambling. When finished I put them on a cutting board and sliced into strips. I really hate recipes that say add to taste. What the heck does that mean anyway? So I added about 1/3 cup of soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of sesame oil and 2 teaspoons of oyster sauce. My hubby went back for seconds raving about how good this was and then ate the leftovers for lunch the next day raving again about how terrific this fried rice was. This is now on my regular rotation for Meatless Mondays and side dishes. Thanks for posting a really great recipe.","the KEY to fried rice is using leftover, COLD, cooked rice. This is the only way....","My son loved this rice but I made a few changes as well. I added some leftover rotisserie chicken (so it could be a complete meal), a small can of mixed peas & carrots, onion, and a dash of red pepper and 1 1/2 tbsps of soy sauce. *Now here's the fun part....before serving it to my 6 year old son, I put his portion in a large funnel, then flipped it out onto his plate to make a ""volcano"". You can use shreaded carrots, duck sauce, or a bit of tomato sauce to put near the top of the cone to appear as lava!!! This is one of his absolute favorites!!!","I rate this recipe 2 out of 5 stars, for the following reason: This recipe calls for too much water to cook the rice. For traditional fried rice, you need to use equal amounts of water and rice - for 2 cups, you should also add 1 tsp of sea salt to the water. By having a ""drier"" rice, it will absorb even more of the oil and flavorings and have the texture of true fried rice from a restaurant. Also, where are the bean sprouts?! The addition of sprouts adds a very pleasant crunch and additional texture. Please share this with your readers. Bon appetit!","Two problems with this recipe: Water needs to be reduced to 3 cups. Using a ratio of 1-1/2 water to 1 rice will help keep the rice grains separate. Secondly, rinse the excess starch off of the rice. Put the rice in your pot, fill with cold water and stir. Drain the rice. Repeat at least once. The excess starch acts like glue when cooked making the rice clump up more.","A good basic recipe on which to build. I do think one should also add onion and/or scallion, always. I like using dark soy sauce when available. I also add ground ginger, a bit of minced garlic, ground white pepper, and a soupcon of oyster sauce, and when available, a bit of fermented black bean paste. I like using basmati rice, prepared the day before, and allowed to cool overnight in the refrigerator. In preparing the basmati, brown the uncooked rice very lightly in oil before adding the water to prepare it. As to the oil used, peanut is the most authentic, though canola or (for health-conscious folks) grapeseed oil (available in the Kosher foods section at WalMart, for example). Other oils-- including corn and even soybean, as well as olive-- are too strongly (or inauthentically) flavored. The sesame oil should be the dark variety, not the light, and go easily with it since it is very strongly flavored-- too much will be overwhelming to the more delicate flavors. If one likes the dish hotter than the white pepper will make it (and white pepper has less bite but more heat than black), one can add Szechuan pepper, if available. Or one can add hot capsicum-derived pepper. To do it right one really needs a gas stove, where one can get the temperature of the wok locally VERY high... in restaurants I have observed the chefs actually letting the oil flame a little, though I do not advise this at home! But the high heat, apparently, is of the essence. Bon appetit!",Very simple and very good only think I changed was the veggies I added didn't have all of them on hand.,"A really good base recipe! I would note that it's best to use leftover rice, or rice that has been given enough time to get COLD in the fridge to firm up - makes it come out less sticky and gooey. I would also add that Sesame Oil is a MUST, as is Oyster Sauce (enough to coat). I will use frozen peas and carrots again, but instead of boiling them, I'll just run them under cold water to allow them to thaw. Everything seemed too mushy to me. And ginger and garlic are a must, as well! A great way to keep it simple, I just wanted to kick it up a notch. Thanks for sharing! :)","I usually make my own fried rice but thought I would find a recipe and learn how to ""do it the right way"". I'll go back to my old way; saute chopped onions and garlic, add left over STEAMED rice, fry with just enough soy sauce to you liking. Spread rice mixture to make a little empty spot in the center. Drop 1-2 eggs to scramble in the middle and then mix all together. That's it!","I've been making fried rice like this for years. The only thing different you need to do is either fry the uncooked rice in a little oil before adding water and bringing to a boil or use day old rice. By toasting the rice, you keep it separated more so it isn't as sticky. I typically use shredded cabbage and wedges of onion in my veggies that I add too. Sometimes I add spinach or sweet peppers. You really can add anything but carrots and peas are the standard for most restaurants. I also sometimes cook my rice in broth so it is more flavorful.","This recipe as written isn't bad, just lacking some key things. You need to use day-old rice for fried rice otherwise it goes to mush quickly. I usually mix my soy sauce, sesame oil and rice wine (a must) before adding to the rice. I add the eggs at the end after making a""well"" in the rice. I just crack them in, season them with a little salt and pepper and break them into strips after they *almost* cook through. A pinch of sugar and thinly sliced green onions mixed into the finished rice truly completes it. It sounds strange but a pinch of sugar rounds out the flavour... try it, you'll like it.","I've made this dish many, many times with great sucess. I do recommend that (1)the seseme oil be used -don't skip this step and (2) use cold rice!","I love fried rice! One of the most important things for me is to make rice not sticky, falling apart. So here's my trick: just fry dry rice on a dry pan before cooking! Heat a pan over medium, pour dry rice on it, stir until you hear popping sound. Let it cool down before the actual cooking! That's it! Your rice will be still delicious but separate as a true restaurant style dish :)","So I tried this recipe at the last minute and kept my fingers crossed. I didn't have any enriched rice and brown rice would've taken too long, so I went w/ good ol' minute rice. Cooked the rice in chicken broth as recommended. Used a cup of frozen peas and carrots. Also added pre-cooked non-breaded cut up chicken tenders. It was a huge hit! I was asked to make more tomorrow night and to make double so there would be leftovers. My boys did rock paper scissors to see who would get the bit that I left in the pan. One of my best throw-together dinners ever!","I made this for dinner tonight and we all loved it! I added oil to a pan, added diced onion and 2 cloves of garlic. When fragrant, I scrambled two eggs and then added 1 cup of mixed veggies. When the veggies were heated through, I added the rice and cooked until warm. I added a couple of Tbsp of oyster sauce and the same of soy sauce, finishing with drizzle of sesame oil. The end result was absolutely delicious - better than any Chinese take-out I've had!","Yummy and simple, however, fried rice is best made with cold day old rice so that it doesn't clump together. Sometimes I add leftover cooked chicken or chinese sausage. Thanks!","My first time trying this! I read all the reviews and used cold cooked rice, added chopped garlic and green onion with a bag of frozen peas & carrots to the hot oil in the wok. Added the rice and drizzled the soy sauce over as I stirred.Made a well and scrambled the eggs in the middle of the wok. I added some cooked chopped rotisserie chicken and a small amount 1/2 C of chicken broth to keep it from getting too dry. It was great and even better the next day warmed up! I'm going to try with shrimp next.I also added 1/4 C oyster sauce as one reviewer mentioned. Additional note: As I have made this many more times, I have found that adding chopped red pepper, onion and mushrooms to the saute step is fabulous! This is better than my local Asian restaurant!","A great recipe!! Used a lot of different tips from other users, including onion and garlic, frozen carrots and peas and definitely adding oyster sauce. I've already made it a few times. Last night I tried it with brown rice...still great.",,,,,,,
202,"We eat this all the time. Here is my tip, melt the butter in a sauce pan and then add the breadcrumbs. Stir for about one minute and then put onto the Salmon. This makes the topping crunchy and the butter is more evenly spread.","Great! I like more mustard than calls for---enough to coat well. I use a sweet dijon or country style dijon mustard. Homemade bread crumbs the best--you can leave more coarse. Broil the top if you want the coating more crunchy or spray tops with a pump butter spray such as ""Can't Believe it's Not Butter"" type---coats better than drizzling melted butter and therefore browns better. My husband hates dijon mustard and still asks for this salmon dish. It is also wonderful cold the next day for a snack or on a nice salad! Thanks for sharing the recipe! It's a KEEPER!",I thought salmon was dry and boring until I tried this recipe. It seemed a bit mushy after baking so I broiled the top for 2 minutes and then it was perfect! I will make this frequently and try the leftovers over salad as others have suggested.,"Wow! My first time cooking salmon, and it turned out amazing--my man was impressed. I made breadcrumbs from leftover italian bread, added some crushed slivered almonds to the top of the filets, drizzled some olive oil between them on the pan, cooked them in the oven for 13 minutes, then put them in the broiler for another 2 minutes--perfect!","Easy, Quick, Tasty, Nutritious, even Impressive Looking if you so choose!! Due to the Foil lining of the baking pan, it's a very quick cleanup, and you can enjoy dinner at your leisure. GREAT recipe!!",Very tasty...the indgredients didn't overwhelm the salmon; it really let the flavors of the salmon come through. Salmon also was timed perfectly and came out nice and moist. I also used olive oil instead of butter and added a little fresh dill on top.,"For a serving for two, I used two portioned salmon fillets, a combo of whole grain and dijon mustard (about a tablespoon or two of each), salt and pepper, and panko (Japanese) breadcrumbs instead of the Italian-style for extra crunch. Drizzled a little olive oil on top of the panko instead of the melted butter and baked. In my oven, it only took 5-10 minutes on 400* and a few minutes under the broiler to make the top a little crispy and golden. Great recipe- I'll be making this again.",So easy and impressive results. I used this on orange roughly fish as well with great results too.,I didn't care for this that much. My husband and I don't like fish much so maybe that's the problem. I used mahi mahi and low fat marg.,This is a fantastic recipe. My husband loves it! I am from Seattle so I know Salmon. Anyone who thinks salmon is dry has completely ove cooked this beautiful fatty fish.,"What an amazing dish!!! I used the frozen salmon filets from the freezer section, and they were just as good, also cheaper than fresh. I used spicy brown mustard (instead of dijon) and also used finely crushed multi grain crackers (instead of bread crumbs). I also added one tbsp. of worchestire sauce to the mustard. OMG this was one of my favorite foods I've eaten in my life!!! Great recipe!","For a healthier version, left out the butter and salt, coated foil with olive oil and drizzled 1 T. olive oil over the bread crumbs sprinkled with garlic powder, and a little oregano and patted down a little. Served with garlic mashed potatoes that were made with olive oil instead of butter. Will make this often.","Have had to recently increase my omega 3's in my diet and though I'd try this recipe. As I am more of a texture girl, I loved the soft, moistness of the fish combined with the crunch of the topping. Mixed my bread crumbs into the melted butter and then added it to the fish for a more even distribution. Served with Company Couscous also from AR. Very nice dinner indeed! Thank you ChristyJ.","Wow, is this a fantastic way to prepare salmon! I'd never baked salmon before (always grilled or broiled it), but it came out so moist and delicious. The topping was fantastic too... my husband and I love Dijon. Our 11 year-old wasn't too sure at fist, but ended up eating a whole fillet. Thank you so much for this recipe, Christine!","This was wonderful. The fish counter at my local supermarket carries boneless, skinless salmon so I lucked out! I used Italian panko breadcrumbs & instead of butter, I sprayed each fillet with olive oil from my olive oil mister. Served with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site along with green beans. So quick & easy. Will be making again. Thanks for the recipe.","Sooo easy. I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used Ritz crackers. Worked just as well. My entire family -- including the picky 9-year-old -- decided it goes on our repeat list.","I added about 1-2 tbls. of honey to the mustard and let sit on the fish for about 20 minutes. Also for a GREAT crunchy texture I used Panko (japanese) bread crumbs. They can be found at many grocery stores. This got rave reviews for our Salmon Sunday dinner! My son's (age 14) had a friend over for dinner, not a big fish eater. He ate EVERY bite! Will make again.","I made this for my neighbors (one spouse is very sick) and I received a Thank You note from them telling me that they felt like they were eating at a 5 Star restaurant! I bought a whole 1/2 salmon at Costco, and was able to get 8 great pieces of salmon (with some left) so I cooked 8 individual meals and share as well with another neighbors, an older couple with an older son. They also sent me a note complimenting the salmon as being a real ""gourmet"" treat. As for me, my hubby and daughter, we were all ""wow""! what a fantastic and easy recipe! Thank you so much for sharing - no changes made to a great recipe!! and thank you for recommending this recipe to me back in March - very much appreciated!!",It was Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with the knife! I was worried the dijon would be too strong or mustardey but it wasn't. Will definitely make again (maybe with less butter)!,"I've been making this recipe for a couple of years. It's my wife's favorite salmon dish, and I find it tasty, as well. As the household cook, I like the ease of preparation. It's simple, fast and reliable. I also follow REBECCAANNE22's recommendation of melting the butter in a saucepan, and then stir in the breadcrumbs. The coating is much better because of it.","this was very good. I did follow another reviewers advice and mixed the melted butter with the breadcrumbs. I also, added parmesan and chopped slivered almonds to the breadcrumbs. I baked it at 400 for 30 minutes and that was perfect!","This recipe wasn't what I was expecting. Very dry, and the mustard hardly gave it a taste. I wouldnt make this recipe again. I couldnt believe that people gave it such rave reviews.","This was great! My husband loves salmon, but I am usually just OK with it. I loved this recipe. I drizzled a little honey on top before sprinkling on the bread crumbs, and I sprinkled a little parsley on top for color. Served with a boxed rice pilaf - an easy and delicious dinner.","When I made this I used smooth Dijon mustard, and then put a drop of honey (blossom type, but I guess any kind would do, just a little drop, about a teaspoon) on each fillet then the salt and pepper and then the breadcrumbs and then drizzled over the melted butter. I'm not really big on fish but this was really tasty and I would definitely make it again. My husband, who normally eats his dinner like someone who hasn't seen food for month, ate it slowly as he wanted to savour the flavours as he thought it was the best salmon dish he had ever had. I served it with mashed potatoes with creme fraiche, salt and pepper and some butter, and leeks seasoned with salt and pepper and some butter. It was really good. Give it a go, it's quick and easy and very tasty.","Just made this for dinner - excellent!!! I skipped the butter and drizzled olive oil over the fillets instead. I'm going to use more Dijon on the thicker parts of the fillet next time, as the thinner ends of the fish had a lot more flavor than the middle.","YUM! The salmon tasted SO good! This is a great recipe, though I did alter a few things. I used honey mustard instead of Dijon and I mixed the mustard with a tablespoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of basil before spreading over the salmon. I also followed the tip Rebecca's tip and melted the butter and breadcrumbs in a saucepan before putting onto the salmon. I will definitely continue using this in the future!","Incredibly moist, easy and fairly healthy. The flavors were nice and balanced between the salmon and topping. I used Panko crumbs and drizzled on olive oil instead of butter. Next time I'll bake it at a lower temp so there's less albumin (the white congealed substance on cooked salmon) and then broil it for a few minutes for a crunchy top. Ready to make it again!",New Year's resolution was to eat healthier...include more fish in our diets. Only problem my Husband HATES fish. So I tried this tonight. I added a tablespoon of honey and like another reviewer butterflied the fillet and spread honey/mustard in the center as well as top. I used only 1-1.5 tbsp. of butter to keep the recipe light. My husband not only ate it but said he thought it was good and at the end of the meal said he would eat this a few times a month. WOW he has NEVER eaten a piece of fish that he liked before and he's 38 years old! Quite the compliment. Excellent recipe! P.S. my 6 year old thought it was pretty good to. I am a salmon lover and this is my new favorite recipe.,The wife loved this. At first I thought mustard with salmon can't be good. Glad I tried it. Thanks..........,A cook from northern NY: This is the best salmon recipe I have tried. I did bake it longer than the instructions: 15 minutes at 400 degrees and an additional 15 - 20 minutes at 350 degrees. It was perfect!,"consider a course ground mustard for a bit more texture and panko breadcrumbs for more rewarding, more crisp crust",,,,,
203,I used a 9-lb spiral cut honey cured ham with the stated brown sugar amounts and cooked on low for 4 hours. I sealed over the ham with foil and then put on the lid. The ham was delicious and very moist. This is a great option for large family gatherings when your oven is being used for other dishes. I'll definitely use this one again.,"I am sure this is a great recipe from all the reviews. The problem I had was I have a small crock pot, so I purchased a 3 lb picnic ham which to my delight fit perfectly in my crock pot. I had no idea how to adjust the time difference so I figured 3-4 hours on low. Apparently it was done in about an hour or two. At 3 1/2 hrs it was brown and tough and in the garbage. So I just wanted to write this to help someone in the same predictament.","Just be sure to buy a picnic ham (picnic shoulder or pork shoulder?)and not a smoked ham like I did! By mistake I used a bone-in smoked ham & this was weird. It turned dark brown and fell apart. Otherwise, am sure it's a good recipe like the others say. Wish recipe had stated to NOT use a traditional smoked ham for us who don't normally buy non-traditional pork cuts.","I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Sooo easy, and it turned out excellent. My husband wanted ham for Thanksgiving, and I knew the oven would be in use, so I wanted a slow cooker recipe. This one was perfect. I used a 2½ pound boneless ham, so I cut the brown sugar down to around 3/4 of a cup (½ cup in the bottom of the slow cooker and 1/4 cup rubbed on the ham). I flipped it around periodically while cooking so all sides would be evenly coated, plus I basted it once in a while with the brown sugar syrup. Even my picky 2-year old daughter (who does NOT like meat) enjoyed it... She finished a whole serving! Thanks for an excellent recipe!","Mmmmm - really delicious, and my mother-in-law kept tellimg me how good it was! I used a shank-end spiral-sliced ham and was able to squeeze it into my 7 qt slow cooker by laying it sideways and kind of squishing it in (the spiral slicing made it kind of flexible). One word of caution to anyone wishing to use a spiral-sliced ham.... 8 hours is really too long, try 4 or 5 hours. I can't wait to try this recipe with a non spiral-sliced ham.","Thanks for the recipe! Just a turkey wasn't going to be enough meat for Thanksgiving this year, so being able to cook a ham on the counter and not worry about oven space was a blessing! I studded the ham with whole cloves and layed pineapple rings on top of it as my mom does and added the juice to the brown sugar mixture on the bottom. My guests were in love with the way my house smelled, and by the end of the night there was turkey left over, but not a bit of ham!!","This was the best ham I ever had! I grew up on a hog farm, so I've eaten my fair share of it too. It was so juicy and tender, I had to serve it with a spoon because it just fell apart! My husband absolutely loved it and said that I better hold on to this recipe. I think I can remember it, its so simple. I am a slow cooker novice, and the fact that this recipe had no liquid scared me a little, so I did add a little water to the brown sugar at the bottom to make it soupy, and only used a cup and a half of brown sugar. I don't think I would have needed to though, there was alot of liquid from the ham. Definate keeper! Mmmmmm!!",I only had a small 2.5 lb. ham without a bone and it still turned out great in my small crock pot with 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar. It wasn't dry at all.,"I'm Australian, so I has to use a 2.5 kilosemi-boneless shoulder ham from Woolies. I was worried that one ham and no liquid would result in burnt sugar all over the crock pot, so I added one little juice box of tropical juice and only used 1 cup of brown sugar. This worked beautifully, and the ham was fully cooked (i.e. the ham bone pulled out)after 7 hours. My ham didn't quite fit in the crock pot, to I tightly covered the top of the crockpot with aluminum foil and rested the lid on top, and it cooked just fine. A great way to cook ham! I will definitely use this one again, especially at holidays when you need the oven for something else.","This is so easy, and it's delicious! I do mix a little pineapple juice with the brown sugar--for flavor, not b/c you need the moisture. The only thing I would warn about: cook time. The first time I did this was w/ a 10 pound spiral-cut, I intentionally lowered the cook time to 4 hours--it was still more than I would have liked. Now when I use this recipe I just feel the ham (I have to use foil over the top b/c the lid won't fit) until it's warm all the way through--about 3 hours on low, 1 1/2-2 on high. Anyway, hopefully that helps someone! :)",This is one of our favorite recipes and have made it a half a dozen times or so. It is so easy to prepare before I go to work in the morning and when I get home it is ready and delicious. What a welcome smell when I walk in the door. Thanks for this recipe.,"Some will love this, some won't. We LOVED it. If you like dishes like pulled pork or a potroast that falls apart in shreds, this is a great way for you to prepare ham. It gets all the meat and flavor off the bone and there is very little waste, though you have to be willing to pick through the mass of meat and discard little bits of gristle and fat. I don't think you need to find the ""picnic ham"" that the recipe lists (I think it suggests that kind because it is cheaper and because this recipe allows you to get all the meat off the bone). You can use any smoked ham, alhough, as others have suggested, stay away from the spiral sliced hams. Get an unsliced one. Speaking of spiral sliced, if your idea of ham is beautiful, pink slices on a holdiday plate, this is probably not the recipe for you. For that kind of a presentation, the ham should just be heated through or glazed a bit. But if you like a pile of delicious meat to pick through that is tender, juicy, and flavorful, try this recipe. I prepared exactly as instruted except also put a few slices of pineapple on top in the crock pot (no juice) and just a sprinkle of ground cloves on the brown sugar. Neither was necessary, though.",Excellent Recipe Cook Time is way to long. If you own a fairly new crock pot brought within the last 5-10 years you only need to cook for 1 to 2 hours max. If you leave the ham in the crock pot after it is turned off it will still continue to cook. I used a honey smoked spiral ham 9lb ham. I added pancake syrup nutmeg and cinnamon to the brown sugar and ham I covered it with foil and then put the top on it for 2 hours. It came out beautiful and delicious - I think it would have been even better if I cooked it for an hour and let it sit in the juices for another hour. Becareful spiral hams dry out very easy. Even on this low temp and cooking for only 2 hours I had a few pieces that were dry but the rest of the ham was moist and outstanding to say the least. You do not need to add any liquid - your crock pot will be half full with the liquid the ham produces when it is done!,"This is the second time I have reviewed this great recipe. This time I am adding an additional twist. When the pork has finished cooking in the crock pot, remove it to a plate and tightly cover with tin foil. Don't worry, it will stay hot and moist for the time you need to do the rest. Strain the juices into a saucepan and heat. Take some of the juice and add cornstarch and blend to a runny paste. It is important NOT to use flour and to use cornstarch as this is a sauce, not a gravy. Add the paste to the juice in the saucepan and boil it to cook and thicken. Then add what ever you would like for taste. I added a couple of teaspoons of mustard, just enough to give it a bit of tartness but not enough to overwelm it. It helps to do a taste test before adding more. The result is an amazing sauce to serve with the cooked pork. Yummy!","This recipe results in a moister ham than one baked in the oven. You CAN use a pre-cooked spiral cut ham, but you have to cook it for a much shorter time than the recipe indicates. I used a 10 lb. spiral cut, pressed the brown sugar all around it, and drizzled with a little honey. I added a 6 oz. can of pineapple juice for some moisture. I couldn't cover the crockpot, so I put a small piece of foil over the top of the ham itself (to prevent the condensation from leaking out) and then sealed the crock pot with another larger piece of heavy duty foil. I cooked for 3 1/2 hours on low and that was more than enough. Baste with juice after you remove foil, and baste again when you put it on the serving plate. The result was a ham that moist and delicious. It was a big hit, and needed no attention after the initial set up in the crockpot.","I've made this recipe a couple times, and it's wonderful. You'll get better results if you get a bone-in butt or shank portion ham, but not spiral sliced. I pour a 6-oz. can of pineapple juice in the bottom of the cooker, put in ham, and only about a cup of brown sugar on top. If you can't get the lid on tight because of the ham size, cover tightly with foil.","I make this ham all the time. So simple and it comes out falling to pieces (which is what it's supposed to do) and deliciously sweet. Only thing I do different is to put the brown sugar in about 1 cup of boiling water. You really don't need to do that I just like a little liquid in there to get it going but the ham will make enough liquid to cover itself. I get a whole smoked (totally cooked) bone-in ham from the farmer at the market. I haven't ever looked but you could get that at the grocery store or local meat market too. I don't know what a ""picnic"" ham is but I really wouldn't suggest a pre-sliced ham. My mom grew up on an Iowa pork farm and says this is just like her mom made. Please don't think that this recipe will result in a ham that would be on the cover of a magazine. It's all about the natural flavor of the ham here.","I think I am the only one out of all the reviews that had trouble with this. I was so excited to prepare this because the ratings were so high. But it just didnt' work out for me. I did exactly as the recipe said. I had to trim some of the meat to it would fit, and even still it wasn't a perfect fit so i covered the crock with tin foil. I cooked on low for eight hours during the night, i woke up in time to shut it off so it didn't over cook. To my surprise there was burnt sugar and no juices as everyone else speaks of. I turned the meat over and added a quarter cup of water and let cook a few hours longer it did indeed make juice but by that time the juices were overruled by smell of the burnt sugar. My kids thought i made pulled pork! I ended up running out to the store to buy a roast for dinner instead, wouldnt' have been a big deal if i didn't have company coming over. I just dont' know what i did wrong, not sure i want to risk it again though.","I will never use oven space to bake a ham again. I just used a 9 lb Farmer John ham, it was too big to use the lid on my slow cooker, so I just sealed really tight with 2 layers of heavy duty foil before I placed he crock inside the cooker. I used 2 cups brown sugar and added sliced pineapple. I was short on time so I cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours. It was perfect! Juicy and tender and came out even better than it does in the oven. Will definitely make again for the next holiday. Thanks!","This was the BEST ham I have ever had, Period. I was a little concerned because of the cost of the meat and it was Easter but decided why not. I had a double smoked bone in ham @ 7-8 lbs fully cooked. I put the brown sugar in the bottom, put ham in poured a little bit of pineapple juice on top and rubbed brown sugar all over the ham. Cooked on low for 4 hours and never lifted the lid. Wonderful rave reviews, juicy, cut like a dream!! I will never make a ham any other way EVER!! Thanx for such a great recipe!!!",Made this for Thanksgiving dinner to serve along side the turkey. I got more compliments on the ham than the turkey. I am known for making a delicious turkey however this ham out shined it. Hard to believe something so simple could be so delicious. My step daughter said she only eats honey baked hams but this one was better. For the most part I followed the recipe with a few adjustments. I cut off the thick layers of fat from the pork shoulder ham. Prepared ham & crockpot with the brown sugar. I covered the top of crockpot with foil until the ham started shrinking from cooking then I replaced foil with crockpot lid. When it started showing signs of being done I turned it over on one side. Let it cook for a bit then turned it on the other side. This was the easiest and most delicious part of the meal. A must try.,"Awesome! My husband insist on me cooking ham this way from now on. I too ran into the issue of my ham being too big. The bone would not allow the lid to fit on so since the crock portion of my crock pot was oven proof, I left the recipe as is, put aluminum foil over it and put it in the oven for the same amount of time on 250 degrees. Most crock pots cook between 200 (low) and 300 (high) degrees. It was soooo tender it fell off the bone and even in the oven, with no water added, I still ended up with many inches of water turned juice. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.","Five stars for ease of preparation alone! Absolutley one can use a precooked smoked ham. I used one that was 7.5 lbs, added 1/3 C water and let it go on low for two hours. Excellent!","Here's a tip: look at at the reviews in reverse rating order (click sort by rating twice) so that you end up reading all the negative reviews first. It really gives some insight into the recipe. This is especially useful when there are hundreds of reviews. Having said this I was skeptical cuz of all the neg. reviews. I can honestly say this is a great, simple recipe. Followed to the letter, I don't how you can wrong? Some people put foil over top, maybe this causes excess browning? Obviously you have to use your discretion for cooking times, especially with various makes and models of crockpots. If you're home you can periodically baste with the juices. I LOVED this recipes. So super duper easy, moist and melted in my mouth. YUM!","Excellent recipe. I've made this three times now. I give it four stars only because I had to make some adjustments. I find that since most hams are fully cooked, you only need a few hours for this recipe. Not nearly as long as the recipe calls for. If I hadn't checked my ham, it would have been all dried out. I put ALL the brown sugar on top of the ham. I followed the recipe and put the brown sugar in the bottom the first time I did this, and the bottom couple of inches of the ham were a little too doused in brown sugar. It saturates the meat, and tastes kind of funky. Also, I put a double layer of aluminum foil over the entire crock pot container, and put the lid down on top of it to reflect heat back down to the top portion of the ham. With the changes I made, this was an excellent way to free up oven space for holiday dinners.","This ham was fantastic! Had to modify the recipe a little bit, because I was only cooking for two. Used a 2 lb. smoked, boneless shoulder butt ham, a 1/2 cup brown sugar, and cooked for approximately 4 hours on low. About 2 hours into the cooking time, I was worried that the sugar would start to stick to the crock pot and burn, so I also added a 1/2 cup of applesauce to the melting brown sugar, and during the last hour of cooking, brushed the ham frequently with the brown sugar and applesauce mixture. Was soooo incredibly tasty! I will be making this often.","This worked out very well! I had a boneless 4 lb spiral cut ham & I had a heck of a time trying to decide how long it should be in there for! I used about 1 1/2 c. brown sugar & poured a bit of orange juice in, basting it w/ it's own juices occasionally. It turned out really well, I cooked it for 2 hrs. on low (8 hr. setting) and then set it to warm another 30 in. until I was done preparing the rest of the meal. By the end of the cooking time there was about 1 in. of juice in the bottom of the pot. Nothing was burnt, as some previous reviews had mentioned. It really didn't taste too different from cooking it in the oven but it did come out juicy & tasty! Maybe I'll add more brown sugar next time (I love it!). I'll definitely use this recipe again, esp. for the convenience factor of not having to cook it in the oven along with the 4 other dishes I had to cook!",,,,,,,,,
204,"OK, I took liberty w/ this recipe & made a few changes. I let my filets rest for an hour (helps keep the meat tender...if you apply heat to chilled meat it shocks it & causes it to toughen up) before salt & peppering them (used Paula Deen's house seasoning). I also chose to broil mine & then pulled them out to rest again (this allows the juices to distribute evenly) before I started the balsamic mixture. I did not cook the steaks in the balsamic glaze, instead I doubled the amount of balsamic, added a bit of sugar & garlic (per previous reviews), used merlot but did not double it, & reduced it on the stovetop for about 10 minutes until it was kinda thick & syrupy. I topped my steaks w/ small amounts of crumbled gorgonzola cheese ...broiling for just a minute or two to melt the cheese. I plated the steaks & drizzled the balsamic ""syrup"" over the top. These were out of this world good! The sweetness of the glaze paired w/ the pungency of the cheese is a taste sensation that my hubby & I really enjoyed!!!!","Here's the trick to make this recipe work: We seasoned the filets with salt and fresh ground pepper and let them rest out of the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes; THEN, we grilled them. In the meantime, we mixed the balsamic vinegar, red wine (used Bordeaux) and a generous pinch of brown sugar. Let it reduce and then served in little sauce cups alongside the filets. My husband LOVED this. I didn't want to take the chance of ruining some great filets by cooking them in the wine/vinegar mixture since a lot of people were turned off by this in their reviews. By allowing it to reduce, it was a little bit thicker (still a bit too thin for me however) and you can merely dunk your bite into the sauce, thereby adjusting how much or little you would like. Will make this again because of the simplicity of the recipe.","This glaze is the best sauce I've ever tasted. I think it's impossible to mess it up, you could put in any variation of the ingredients and it would still be tasty. I followed the recipe until the steaks finished, then took them out, and let the glaze cook down for about 3 minutes, adding brown sugar (1 to 2 tbsp.) and butter (1/2 to 1 tbsp). I forgot to double the recipe like everyone else mentioned, make sure you do! Not only is the sauce fantastic on the meat, but SO good with asparagus, dip bread in it, put it on potatoes. I'm going to make it over and over again.","This was excellent but I made some changes to help it. First, I salt and peppered the steaks and then placed them in the pan in a little bit of olive oil (1-2 tbsps) and browned them on med-hi for 1 minute both sides. I put the 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar in a sauce pan and 1/4 cup sherry (just because i didn't have red wine on hand today) and added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 heaping tbsp brown sugar. I let this simmer while the steaks were browing. Then I poured the sauce over the steaks and turned heat to low and covered. I cooked my husband's filet for 4 minutes each side to be medium, but I like my with less red and cooked my 6 minutes each side. The sauce reduced perfectly and it became a glaze and was wonderful. Make sure you don't let it reduce too much or it will be a burnt. I liked it with the sherry so much I don't know if i will bother trying with the red wine or not. It had a wonderful flavor. I would definitely only make with garlic added. PERFECT... we felt like we had just eaten in a steak restaurant!","Happy Valentines Day, Oh my!!!! This was heaven, I sauteed about a cup each of onions & mushrooms in 1 tbsp each butter, olive oil, & 1 clove garlic when tender moved to a bowl, increased heat and placed steak in pan, turning after 1 min each side, did not cover, and turning again after 4 min each side, added the balsamic/red zinfandael after 8 min, after 10 min total I added the mushroom/ onion mixture to the pan for another 4 min turnin the steaks again, aftern 14 min total removed the steaks to a plate and continued to reduce the onion/mushroom mixture for another 4 min while the steak rested, a perfect warm pink center, and a mushroom/onion, balsamic/zinfandel side dish to drool over. Happy Valentines Day","I can't comment on the preparation of the steaks in this recipe, as hubby grilled ours outdoors over charcoal. I do have to say, however, that I would never simmer the filets in the reduction. In my view that's a good way to ruin very expensive filets! Having said that, I guess what I'm reviewing here is the balsamic/wine reduction which was just too simple to be that good! Richly flavorful and syrupy, and to think all you have to do is mix up a GOOD red wine and a GOOD balsamic vinegar and simmer it until it reduces about 75 percent. This was as good as any fancier or difficult glaze or reduction than I've ever made or eaten at fine restaurants. This definitely will be something I'll remember to make again.","I absolutely loved this recipe. We wanted something other than the same old turkey for Christmas this year. And...We didn't want Christmas leftovers either. This was perfect. I tripled the recipe and served 6. I served it with roasted red potatoes and green beans. I also served it with homemade foccatia bread served with olive oil and basalmic vinegar. Steamed artichokes for appetizer and a great recipe I found for chocolate pudding cake by Emeril Lagasse. My Brother-in-law commented that in a resaurant that would have been a good $60-80 meal per person! That is the best complement I've ever gotten for my cooking. I was surprised that other people didn't find the recipe as outstanding as we did. The key thing i think is to use good quality ingredients. This isn't something I could afford to make every week. The steaks alone cost me $55, not to mention the wine...but the topper is the get the best basalmic that you can afford. We used one aged 18 years. It was really sweet. Tasted almost like raisins. I give this 5 stars!!!","Made this last night for husband's birthday dinner. We both loved it. After reading some of the reviews here, I cooked the sauce separately and made some changes. Used 2 5 oz filets wrapped in bacon and rubbed with coarse ground black pepper & Mrs Dash Garlic & Herb seasoning. Seared the bacon in a hot pan by turning steaks on their sides with tongs before cooking 3 minutes on each side for rare. Started out with hot pan and gradually reduced heat as steaks cooked. For the sauce, used red table wine & doubled it along w/the balsamic vinegar called for in the recipe. Added 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp minced garlic. Reduced sauce by half & used for dipping. We thought the sauce complimented the meat wonderfully without overpowering it. This one is definitely a keeper.","Lovely recipe - YUM ! :) So easy and so good ! I made this for my birthday dinner and my husband and I were so pleased at the results. I added a few crushed cloves of garlic to the wine/vinegar and let it sit for a while before starting. I also used a very coarsly ground pepper/salt combination made for meats. Also, with all steak recipes, you should let the meat reach room temperature before cooking.","Tasted like....vinigar...and I really don't think vinegar and steak should go together. needs more of something, salt maybe, onion seasoning would add a nice touch. The peppercorn could stay, but really, I would try this again if I were cooking on the grill, but this just shouldn't be pan cooked together. as a marinade, I'd do it again, but not exactly like this. I really don't think I'll try this again, I think the measurements are off, with the red wine, not sure, but this wasn't as good as I thought it might be. Also, In my opinion, these reviews here, claiming this recipe to be deliscious or wonderful are just plain OVER RATED!....No one in my family was enthusiastic about this one. I was not impressed, and frankly this may very well be the worst flavor for steak I've ever encountered...Minus some vinigar or wine, cocka!!!","Absolutely delicious! Our filets were larger than 4 oz., so I did double the sauce ingredients. Following the suggestions of others, I brushed the filets with olive oil, rubbed them with Paula Deen's House Seasoning (salt, pepper & garlic), and let them sit out of the frig for over ½ hour before cooking. I then seared/browned the filets on all sides. After removing them from the pan and covering them on a plate with foil, I added the wine and vinegar to the pan, stirred to loosen browned bits, and reduced the mixture. One tablespoon of brown sugar and one tablespoon+ of butter was then stirred in. The filets were returned to the pan, turning to coat in the sauce, covered, and simmered for approximately 5 minutes. Result: my husabnad ate his filet as fast as he eats desserts...which means he basically inhaled it because he loved the taste and tenderness so very much. This is a winner of a recipe, and I will definitely use it again and again. Thank you!","We loved this! I used marsala wine instead of red and added some brown sugar. We grilled the steaks vs. doing them in the pan. We rubbed the steaks with a little olive oil, fresh minced garlic, a little salt and cracked black pepper. We served the sauce on the side to dip the steaks into.","For those who are afraid to cook the filet in the glaze or insist on grilling them, a little advice. If you properly sear your beef, any cut, on ALL sides, not just the top and bottom, you will seal in the juices. You do not have to worry about the beef drying out or being ruined. Take heed, you must get a nice sear on all sides. My advice, use clarified butter in a heated pan. Sear top and bottom first and then the sides. You can then cook it the rest of the way on the stove top or in an oven, but done right it is much better and way more tender than broiled or grilled. Outstanding recipe.","Thank you Linda for this decadent glaze. I followed a combination of the original recipe, plus took suggestions from other reviewers and also added more butter (who doesn't love more butter in a recipe). I sprinkled salt and pepper to taste on both sides of the steak. Allowed to rest for 30 minutes on the countertop. Then put 2 T of salted butter in the pan. Once the pan was really hot, I put in the steaks. Allowed to sear on each side for one minute. Then reduced the temperature to med-low. In a 2 c measuring cup, I combined 1/2 c balsamic vinegar and 1/2 c Cabernet (that's what was open at the time), 2 cloves pressed garlic, 1 T brown sugar and 2 T salted butter. Mixed well. Added the sauce to the pan over the steaks. Cooked covered for 3 minutes on each side. Removed the steaks, then continued reducing sauce until it was a glaze (about 6 minutes). My husband who usually adds a sauce to anything, even something that already has a sauce on it, didn't need to put anything else on it. In fact, I caught him sipping the sauce from a spoon.","This recipe is exceptionally delicious. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce ingredients, used a T. of brown sugar, and swirled in a T. or so of butter to finish the sauce on high heat AFTER removing the steaks to a platter. I used a stainless steel fry pan and cranked the heat to super-high; my steaks became crusty and deeply browned. After browning, I removed them to a plate where I loosely draped foil over them. With the heat still on high, I added the balsamic, wine, garlic, salt and pepper and SCRAPED THE FROND from the bottom of the pan. For folks whose sauces remained watery, I suggest that this technique be used in the future. It is vitally important, as well, to use real aged balsamic, as it is pretty viscous with which to begin and helps create the desired glaze. The pat of butter added after the sauce was reduced further tightened my sauce to perfection. Don't be skimpy on the salt and pepper, either! I'm looking forward to making this again and urge others to do the same.",Excellent! I was looking for an easy way to cook a good filet...this was very easy and tasty! For the wine I used a bottle of italian red that we received as a gift. Served it with lobster tails and rosemary-roasted potatoes...will definately make again.,"The recipe is perfect as is, but the directions are not complete for novice cooks. Always let beef rest for 1/2 - 1 hour before cooking. I season beef at this stage while it is sitting out. I usually rub some olive oil (1 tsp.) on beef cuts at this stage to keep them moist - especially if grilling. As for the glaze, if it is a little thin it just needs to be reduced a little more before pouring over the steaks, so remove the steaks when done to taste and turn up the fire a bit to finish reducing the glaze. It is not a gravy or a sauce, it is a glaze. Perfection!","I have made this recipe repeatedly and it is one of our favorites. I have made it exactly like the directions with good results. However, I prefer to cook the steaks and allow them to rest while I make the sauce. I cook the sauce until it starts to thicken like a syrup and immediately pour it over the steaks and serve. Wonderful!","I have made this 4 times now and each time has been perfect! I have never had a problem with the vinegar overpowering the meat, if anything, I go heavier on the wine. Done correctly, the result will be a tender, MEATY flavored steak. If you don't like steak on its own, then follow those who have made changes. We like tender, flavorful steak; left alone, this recipe performs. Also, I buy our steak when it is ""special today"" at the market. My friend who grew up working at a butcher shop taught me that the aging on a steak (the browning of the juices in the package) actually makes it more tender. Now if it is green, walk away!",This is simple and comes out great! I've made this a few times and never once had a complaint. I followed the recipe as is and wouldn't change anything. But be sure to start with the meat at room temp.,"Since everyone else is changing the recipe, I'll throw in my two cents. 1). Pan sear the steaks to taste in butter& olive oil. (this is the way Ruth's Chris Steakhouse does it. 2). Deglaze the pan with the wine/balsamic mixture. 3). Simmer and allow the sauce to reduce by half. 4). Drizzle over filet to taste. This is just a slight variation of a Classic French Sauce.","I followed suggestions already posted - 1/2 cup quality balsamic (I used pomegranate balsamic, it was delicious), 1/4 cup dry sherry, heaping tablespoon brown sugar, and 1 minced garlic clove. I cooked the sauce separately until it was syrupy. Let the filets rest at room temp for 45 mins or so (30-60 mins is good), then seasoned with sea salt and fresh ground black pepper on both sides. Cooked on med/high heat for 1 min on each side, then about 4 mins with the saute pan covered (for medium rare). Added about a tbsp of crumbled blue cheese and broiled for a minute or so. Then, drizzled the sauce on it. Had asparagus and mashed potatoes with it. Absolutely phenomenal.",Made filet mignon taste like cheap meat.,Very good. At the end after the steaks are removed add a pat of butter (or a little more if you like) to the sauce and swirl it around just until melted then spoon it over the steaks. Even better!,"I was looking for a quick, easy filet recipe and decided to give this one a try, with a few changes. The ratio of wine to vinegar seemed way off and the technique suggested wasn't exactly what I was looking for. Here's what I did differently: 1) took the meat out of the 'fridge a little over an hour before cooking time 2) seasoned liberally w/ s&p right before putting into into the med-high skillet for 3 mins per side 3) removed the meat and let it rest 4) deglazed the skillet with 1/2 cup red wine (I had bottle of Valpolicella ripasso open, so I used that) until reduced to about half 5) added 1 T balsalmic, 1 clove garlic (chopped), and juices from the resting meat and simmered for 1-2 mins 6) added 1 T butter & added s&p to taste (mostly just p needed) 7) returned the meat to the skillet and basted it repeatedly for 1-2 minutes 8) plated filets and drizzled with sauce.","After cooking the steaks, I removed them from the pan and set them aside. I reduced the heat to medium low and added 1/3 c. of balsamic, 1/3 c. red wine, sliced mushrooms, and 1/2 tsp. of cumin. I let the sauce reduce for about 15 minutes and then added 1 Tbsp. of butter. I put the steaks back into the pan for a couple of minutes to bring them back up to temperature. Delicious!!!!!!!!!!","I let my filets rest while I prepared all of the other parts of my meal, approximately 1 hour, helps keep the meat tender, like others have said. Then I salt(sea salt) & peppered them. I decided to pan fry them, as called for in the recipe, and they turned out beautiful. (Thank God, since they where Omaha filets) I did not cook the steaks in the balsamic glaze. I listened to the other reviewers, and I'm glad I did. I doubled the amount of balsamic, added a bit of brown sugar & garlic, used merlot and doubleed it, & reduced it on the stovetop for about 10 minutes until it was kinda thick, I started this before putting the filets on at all. After the filets had cooked, a poured the glaze over them, and it was amazing. My better half can't wait for our next anniversary!",,,,,,,,,
205,"I loved this recipe! I did mine in the crock-pot and it turn out wonderful! I used 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup (healthy request), 1 packet of beef onion soup mix, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup water and fresh button mushrooms. I put everything together and popped it in the crockpot for 8 hours, and the meat was falling apart. Also I cooked the noodles aldente and then threw them in the crockpot for the last 10 or so minutes. The noodles soaked up the sauce and it was wonderful! Loved this recipe!!!!","This recipe is delicious and is great as is. However, this time I decided to do things somewhat differently. I love garlic and onions, so I added one tablespoon diced garlic and a small onion, chopped. I make the cream of mushroom soup using 1/2 can of milk, then add the onion soup mix and a little more water than called for. I also add about a tablespoon of concentrated beef broth. I added the onions, garlic, and mushrooms to the mixture and than poured over the meat. I have plenty of sauce to mix in with the noodles this way. Just a suggestion for those of you who said you didn't have enough gravy at the end.","This is a long time favorite of my family. We usually add more meat, and use 1/2 cup of red wine in place of the cup of water. Better when cooked at a lower temp for a long period of time (preheat oven to 375 and then turn down to 250 and cook for several hours). Perfect slow cooker recipe - can be left on low all day long! Try serving over rice, rather than the noodles.","This recipe is THE BOMB!!! Not only did my husband love it, but my sister's husband loved it as well. I took the advice to use fresh mushrooms sauted in butter & garlic, browned the meat, then threw everything into the crock pot to simmer for about 5 hours. The meat was SO tender & flavorful...I could eat this stuff forever!!",This ia a Great recipe. It is so simple. I cut up Round steak (extra). I simmered the Round steak with chopped up onions. I added extra cream of mushroom soup (2 cans) because the last time I made it I ended up covering it half way through cooking. Also it made more to go with the 16oz bag of noodles I cooked. I used a can of milk instead of water and added sliced fresh mushrooms rather then canned. Served it with biscuits. My husband Loved it. YUMMY !!! Next time I make it it will be half the onion soup mix (Onion soup mix is very salty) Thank you for sharing .,"This was a good hearty meal. Rather than using canned mushrooms that taste like a can I cut up about 6oz of fresh. Instead of an entire packet of Onion soup mix I used all the onions and half the seasoning...that would have been a little salty. I browned the beef tips with a little butter and the soup mix in my pressure cooker, then added the remaining ingredients, put the lid on and cooked for 30 min. The beef couldn't have been more tender, and my husband loved it. I'd rather not heat the house with the oven...if ya know what I mean, plus this was quicker, and probably more tender. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy recipe.","I hate to rate this after the changes I made, but I have been looking for a decent beef tips and noodles recipe for so long now and am elated to have finally found it. So even though this recipe was a starting point for me, it deserves credit. I took lots of suggestions from others too. Browned stew meat (bite-size pieces), seasoned with pepper, onion and garlic powder. I doubled the recipe, so used 1 can of cr of mush and 1 can of golden mush. 2 cups of beef stock for the water, 1/2 packet of the soup mix plus some real onion (to avoid being too salty). Added maybe a tsp of Kitchen Bouquet, couple splashes of Worsey, 1/4 tsp dried mustard. Deglazed skillet with beef stock. All into crock pot for 4 hours. In the last hour, added the mushrooms and 2-3 pinches of basil (remember to crush between fingers while adding). At the end, 2T cornstarch in a bit of cold beef stock to thicken gravy (leave lid off, 30 mins). Total cook time in crock on High, 4.5 hours. Made 3/4 bag (about 12 oz) of egg noodles and ran a little short, so use a whole 16oz bag for a double batch. Overall, it was perfect! My guys ate this stuff up! Thanks for the recipe and to everyone for all of the added tips.",This recipe was really good. My husband and I made it tonight and he found it a bit salty. We added a bit of sour cream and mixed it in....that helped cut the salt and added some savory richness to the dish. We will definitely make this again!,"This was a wonderful recipe! We added 1 celery stalk chopped into the mixture and since I have never been a fan of egg noodles nor beef strognaff, we served over brown rice, which is a very nice taste. Needless to say, I am going to have to double the recipe next time as my family devoured the meal. Since I have made this a couple times already, some nice side dishes to this, which are also found on this site include Baked Vegetables or Honey Roasted Red Potatoes. Thank you for a great mix-and-go recipe Julie!","Excellent! I read a dozen or so reviews and noted the changes I thought I'd like. I used: 2 Cans Mushroom soup, 1 TBSP Concentrated Beef Broth, 1 Can milk vs water, 1 Chopped onion, 1 tsp chopped garlic, 1 tsp hot paprika, and 8 oz chopped fresh mushrooms and cooked it all on low in my crock pot for 5 hours. My finicky wife loved it over egg noodles as did I. More than enough gravy / sauce for 4. I'm looking forward to leftovers!!! DO THIS RECIPE !!!!! YOU'LL LOVE IT !!","I make this all the time, both when I lived alone and now with my fiance. I like it in the slow cooker with cubed stew meat and omitting the mushrooms (he hates them). By using the stew meat, I leave it in the slow cooker for about 9-10 hours and it is just falling-apart good.",This dish was easy and tasty but too salty for me personally. I know it's the soup mix that was the culprit but didn't see any other option on the store shelf. Will probably make again with more beef. Hubby doesn't do mushrooms so I'll keep those out next time too.,"This was a quick meal that I could just throw in the crockpot at the beginning of the day with meat I found in the back of my freezer and a can of soup I found in the back of my pantry. I used one ""family pack"" of stew meat, Healthy Request mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms, garlic and onions that I sauteed in a little butter and olive oil and instead of water, I used a cup of lemon lime soda (I learned this YEARS ago for really tender ""steak tips""). I did also add a little fresh ground pepper. I didn't serve this over egg noodles, I served this over whipped potatoes with steamed veggies. This was a good ""we're broke"", work-with-what-you-got dinner.","i gave this 4 stars because i did changed some things. i used 2lbs of sirloin steak (seasoned with fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and onion powder) cut into cubes, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, i package of onion soup mix, 2 beef bouillon cubes, half soup can of milk, half can of water, parsley, minced garlic, 2 tsps kitchen bouquet, big splash of worchestire sauce, 1/2 c. chopped onion and 1 lb fresh mushrooms. i browned the steak cubes in a little butter and olive oil and added the chopped onion and garlic the last few minutes. i put everything except the mushrooms into the crockpot on low. about an hour before serving i put in the mushrooms and turned it on high. the last 10 minutes i sprinkled some wondra flour into the crockpot since the mushrooms gave off extra liquid. this came out so good! served it over rice with crusty french bread and a green salad. i fed 6 people with this and they all raved about it! everyone had second helpings. this recipe could be changed up so many ways to suit anyone's taste. thanks julie for a great base recipe..so glad i came across yours!","Good flavor and very easy. However - I think I will rub - the soup mex on the beef strips first and let it sit a half day or so, beef need more umphf for my taste. Hubby loved it and so did my oldest kid, my youngest like the egg noodles with butter and salt best. Now she has a sophisticated palate! Ha ha. She's 5!","Ok, my fiance gave this a 10! He loved it and wants it once a week. Here's what I did: I did follow the heating instructions (400 deg) but I think next time I will do it at 375 deg for 45-50 min. I bought sirloin tip steak thin and cut it in squares and strips. I used fresh baby portabello mushrooms - sliced. I used one can of mushroom soup and one package of beef onion soup mix. I put one cup of whole milk and 1 cup of water. 1 teaspoon of beef seasoned cooking base (Glory Food Brand) Mixed everything together and cooked for 50 min. WOW! He's having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! **Next time, he wants me to put in long strips of onion. Thanks for sharing. It's a winner.","Flavor is good. I love how easy this is to make. Sauce isn't quite a full ""8"" servings though. We had 4, and that was about it. WOuld also be better with fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Needs a little something else too, not quite sure what though. Will play with this again, however., :)","My variation of this recipe includes skipping the onion soup mix and using chopped onion and lots of garlic. I also used fresh chopped mushrooms. I added a 1/4 cup of cooking wine as well for a nice depth to the flavor. I doubled the recipe and we ate half for dinner and the other half goes into the freezer for after the baby gets here. This freezes nicely, just thaw and warm in the microwave for fast dinner!","I make this in the crock pot. I throw in the frozen beef in the morning, cover it with cream of mushroom soup and onion soup mix and serve over either egg noodles or rice.","OMG this is too good! skip the water and use a can of french onion soup instead. also I seared the beef tips before mixing them with with the sauce.I also simmered everything on the stove rather than using the oven because its 95 degrees out. This recipe is super easy and definitely worth a try, you wont be sorry! :)","I tried this recipe last night---it turned out wonderful!! I sauted fresh mushrooms with garlic and some butter and then browned the sirloin a little in the mushrooms, I then put it all together in the oven. The meat was so tender and had a great taste. My husband Loved it. Definetely a keeper.","I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 soup can of milk, 1 can of water (instead of 1 cup), an envelope of brown gravy mix, and one chopped onion to the mixture. I served it over buttered egg noodles with parsley & my husband loved it. This is a keeper.","I made this with a large, very thick round steak, cut into cubes. I dredged the meat Wondra flour and browned them very well. Removed the meat from the dutch oven, then sauteed some chopped onions and garlic until soft. Added 2 cans of Campbells Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup (less salt), 1 can of carmelized onion soup, 1 cup of 2 % milk, 1/2 cup water, 1 Tbl. beef base and about 1 Tbl dried thyme and some freshly ground black pepper. I added the meat back and put into a 300 ºF. oven for 5 hours, until the meat was almost falling apart tender. (I stirred it once at about the 3 hour mark.) Served over buttered egg noodles. DELICIOUS! It made a very large amount, so I froze about 1/2 of it to be eaten on a later date.","I'm perplexed by all the ""surprised"" cooks re the saltiness. COM soup AND Lipton Onion Soup Mix tasting too salty. I bet many of us already knew it would be salty as written. However, I found a nearly Na? free version of COM by Healthy Choice. There, fixed the salt issue. Other than that, I really like this recipe. Yum says the expert cook.",Lacked one important ingredient-flavor. Needs tweeking.,"I ""tweaked"" the recipe a little. Browned the tips w/ fresh garlic and onions, only used 1/2 the pack of soup mix and used beef broth instead of water. Cooked in the crockpot on low for 8 hours - delicious. Family loved it.","This was really, really good. I took a few suggestions and did it this way...I used 1 Can Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic, equal amount of milk, 1 package Beefy Onion Soup Mix, and 1 package of Beef Gravy..WOW! Not salty and it made an awesome gravy!!!","Really good recipe, but as written you're not going to be happy with the outcome. #1 9x13 pan is way too big--I used a 8"" diameter casserole and it was perfect. #2 Cover it or else it will be dry shoe leather by the time the hour cooking time is up. #3 Add 1/2-1 cup of sour cream to the mix before baking--makes a delicious addition to the sauce. Served ours over mashed potatoes because they were ready to go bad--tasted quite good. Next time I'll try it over the egg noodles.","This was really good. I omoted the mushrooms because we don't really care for them. I did add a bit of cornstarch to thicken the gravy. Threw it all in the crock pot, kids even loved it. Will be added to the rotation...Yum!!",Saltier than Lott's wife!,"This was really good! I did change a couple things as other reviewers had recommended. I opted to use soy milk instead of the water, used fresh mushrooms, I added 2 tbs of sour cream, and I seasoned the meat with some pepper and garlic powder. I baked it in an 8x8 pan at 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hours covered. The meat was really tender and it was delicious. I served it over the egg noodles. I will be making this again for sure!!",,,,,
