0,"Excellent and Authentic recipe! A little more work and ingredients, but well worth it. Use FRESH basil for more flavor - I use about 1/2 - 2/3 cup fresh chopped basil. It cooks down and is sooo aromatic. The mix of sausage and beef is sublime, so no need for more salt. I always add a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture (an old italian secret!). I usually make this a day ahead for the flavors and herbs to meld in the fridge then let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking. Have made for company too, and always get RAVES on it's authenticity. Great, winter comfort food and feeds a lot of people. Another tip for lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles. Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min. Noodles won't be cooked but soft, and can complete it's cooking in the oven. I learned this from a caterer - try it!","I made this recipe using some tips and tricks from previous reviewers and from my experience having worked in an italian restaurant. This recipe does not have to be as time intensive as is recommended in the instructions. As another reviewer noted, it is not necessary to cook the noodles--just soak them in hot water while you are cooking the rest of the ingredients. You also do not need to cook the sauce. Sounds bizarre, but it's true. If you make the lasagna ahead and leave it in the fridge overnight, the flavors blend perfectly, no cooking required. For a chunkier tomato sauce, I subbed 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes with diced italian-flavored tomatoes. I layered everything in this order: sauce-noodles-ricotta mixture-sauce-meat-shredded mozzerella...i did 3 layers like this and then finished with a layer of noodles, sauce and shredded mozzerella and a generous sprinkling of parmesean on top. Following this method, I had the whole thing put together and in the fridge in less than an hour. It sat overnight and my husband had it in the oven when I got home from work. Fantastic recipe!","WOW! This really is World's Best Lasagna! From reading all the reviews, I made these changes: Added an additional 1/2 pound of ground meat, omitted the salt, doubled the onions, all the spices, the parsley, canned tomatoes, paste, and sauce. I also doubled the filling ingredients and made three layers instead of two. Everyone raved about the lasagna and I have sauce left over for another use. SIDE NOTE: For anyone who thinks they don't like ricotta cheese: Buy it at an Italian market. Brands such as Sierra or Polly-O. There is no comparison to the taste or texture of supermarket brands. I think that's why I see recipes with regular cottage cheese instead of riccota. I don't use supermarket riccota under any circumstances, it's just plain nasty!","I've convinced 3 (now-ex) boyfriends, my husband, and even a couple Italian friends at school that I make the most incredible lasagna they've ever tasted with this recipe. I make it pretty much as shown, except if I have the time, I let the sauce simmer on the stove as long as possible. I also add a bit of whatever red wine I have on hand to the sauce. And I try to make a double recipe, so I can use the sauce for other things - it works wonderfully for Chicken Parmesan, plain ol' spaghetti, and anywhere else you'd use a red sauce. Everything tastes better the second day, too. Oh, one more thing - I never boil my noodles. I simply buy regular dried noodles, and make sure I have plenty of sauce in the lasagna. It cooks long enough that the noodles boil in the oven, and you end up with a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well.","I read all the reviews and really followed ""Cookerbob""'s advise. Here's what I changed: used 1 lb. LEAN gr. beef, tripled the garlic, reduced sugar to 1 T., reduced salt to 1 t., used 9 lasagna noodles per pan and used 1 pound mozzarella (shredded) cheese per pan. I read the reviews about omitting the fennel and I have to disagree. I believe the fennel is one of the ingredients that makes this dish outstanding. I made the sauce the day before and simmered for 6+ hours. Sounds like a lot of work, but come on! How hard is it to check a pot simmering??! I had enough sauce for 2 pans of lasagna, so that's what I did. Made 2, baked one and froze the other. I just finally made my frozen one yesterday. I allowed it to thaw in the fridge overnight and then baked as directed. Just as delicious as the first batch!!! My hubby is a lasagna snob and says this is the best lasagna recipe ever. I totally agree!","I was so disappointed with this lasagna! I won't be using this recipe again. With such a high rating, I thought it would taste better. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only used 1/3 of the salt called for. (One serving of the original recipe is almost a full daily allowance of sodium.) It was still too salty. It tasted like something you'd buy in the freezer section at the grocery store. Why waste all that time making it at home if it doesn't taste any better than the manufactured stuff and isn't any healthier? There also seemed to be too much sauce and not enough of the ricotta mixture or mozzarella. Suggestions: 1. Leave out the added salt altogether. There's already enough salt in the sausage, parmesan and canned tomato products to season everything. 2. Drain the meat after browning and before adding anything else. All that saturated fat does nothing to improve the flavor. 3. Use oregano instead of Italian seasoning and leave out the fennel. Italian sausage already has fennel in it. 4. Leave out one of the cans of tomato paste. The condensed tomato flavor was so strong it drowned out the spices. 5. Use a full 16-oz block of mozzarella, and grate it instead of slicing it. You'll get more even coverage. 6. Double the ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg, parsley). 7. (Optional) Replace the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of red wine, preferably chianti or cabernet sauvignon.","I quadrupled this recipe for 32 men, and it went over so well ... they came back for seconds, and asked for the recipe for their wives ... now how many men do you know that ask for a recipe? I made a few changes to this recipe based on past reviews and am glad I did ... here are my suggestons ... use fresh whole wheat lasagna noodles (found in the deli dept.) ... no need to cook them and they come in sheets ... make 3 layers for lasagna dish ... therefore, you would require 8 fresh lasagna sheets ... I had to read through a lot of reviews to figure out what to do with the italian sausage, as it doesn't explan in the recipe how to cook that ... what you do is buy mild italian sausages (couldn't find sweet italian sausage and I understand through most reviews that most people can't) ... you then remove the casing around the sausage, remove the meat and fry the meat until cooked in a frying pan ... instead of using 1 tbsp. salt in the sauce, I used 1 tsp. ... and it was perfect ... I suggest going with your taste ... same thing with the sugar ... go with your personal taste ... the layers were a little difficult to figure out so here is what works ... make 3 layers ... first layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... 2nd layer is meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture (add a little nutmeg for taste), parmesan cheese ... 3rd layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... defiitely add the fennel seeds ... gives great f","This was very good. It didn't fit in my 9 x 13 pan, but worked out fine by placing part of the ingredients in a loaf pan. Caution: skip the tablespoon of salt! (Have you EVER heard of a recipe that calls for a full tablespoon?) Between the cheeses and the canned tomato products, no additional salt was needed. This recipe would easily be a base for your favorite additions: spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, etc. Other reviewers were absolutely correct: plan to make this the day before serving. It makes all the difference in the blending of flavors and incredible taste. I served this with homemade cheese bread and a crisp green salad.","I am giving this 5 stars b/c all of my friends liked it and asked me for the recipe! I made this for my women's group holiday dinner. I would personally give it 4 stars. It was a bit too meaty for me and there didn't seem to be enough ricotta (but I know a lot of peopele don't like ricotta anyways). I followed a couple reviewer's suggestions and soaked the noodles in a large roasting pan (try it -there is plenty of room to allow the noodles to lay flat) in VERY hot tap water for about 30 minutes. I added the browned meat / garlic / onion mixture to the tomatoes, paste, sauce, seasonings, etc. WITHOUT simmering. I assembled the lasagna the evening before (sauce, 6 noodles, ricotta, mozzarella slices, sauce, Parmesan, exact same layer again and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and rest of Parm). I purchased a 1 lb. package of sliced mozzarella and ended up using all of it (and it turned out fine). Also purchased mild Italian sausage (not the sweet stuff - couldn't find it). Be sure to use fresh parsley. It gives the dish nice color and adds a fresh taste that you won't get from the dried stuff. Also, be sure to add fennel seed. It really adds nice flavor to the dish. Leftovers were yummy. I took some to my parents, and my mom had one square. My dad ate the other 4! This one's a keeper, and is worthy of all stars because of the compliments - and shortcuts. Try them, they REALLY, REALLY work!. Thanks!","What a great lasagna. Thank you John Chandler for this recipe. After reading several of the reviews I did make some minor changes. I increased the ground beef to 1-1/4 lb, reduced the sugar to 1 Tbsp, reduced the salt to 1 tsp and only cooked 9 lasagna noodles. I made the sauce the day before, simmering it for about 5 hours and stored it in the fridge overnight. I assembled the dish the following morning, put it back in the fridge until ready to cook and serve. Cooked at 350, covered with foil, for about 1-3/4 hours and then another 15 minutes uncovered. The 9 lasagna noodles were just right for three layers in a 9x13 pan. This recipe makes twice as much sauce as you need. I froze the rest and will use it to make this recipe again. You reallllly should try this recipe if you are looking for an excellent lasagna.","Having grown up in a family of excellent Italian cooks, I admit I am a ""tough room"" when it comes to Italian recipes. Despite that, this one is so good that I am sure my mother and grandmother are smiling down from heaven in approval! I saw this same recipe on another site and it only called for 1 teaspoon of salt, not 1 tablespoon. It came out perfect with the lower amount of salt. It also did not call for any salt in the ricotta. I have some recommendations, below: Cut down the water to 1/4 cup. It makes a slightly thicker sauce and I felt the lasagna holds up better that way (although this recipe is good even with more water). Use half parmesan and half romano cheese. It gives a slightly more robust flavor. Put a few tablespoons of the romano/parmesan cheese in with the ricotta mixture. Add a half teaspoon of grated nutmeg in with the ricotta mixture. Increase to one teaspoon of fennel seed. Use 23 ounces of ricotta instead of 16. Use bulk sausage meat if you can find it. Otherwise if you buy link sausage make sure to remove it from the casing and mix it with the ground beef. And finally (and this is very important), make the sauce the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. The sauce tastes better and better as it sits and develops more richness of body and flavor. Trust me, all of these changes will improve the recipe! Mangia!",This truly is the best lasagne. I made it for a family party and everyone raved! I used spicy turkey sausage along with the ground beef and let the sauce simmer for about 4 hours. This will definately be my regular lasagne recipe!,"Great recipe! On the meat sauce, I followed a compilation of other reviewers’ suggestions: reduced salt and sugar by one-half, subbed fresh basil for dried basil, and kept the fennel seeds. On the ricotta mixture, I went to the Italian supermarket deli counter and got homemade ricotta. The only other modification to the ricotta mixture was a couple shakes of nutmeg to the ricotta. I also increased the mozzarella cheese slices and grated Parmesan cheese to a little over 1 pound each. I also soaked the lasagna noodles in hot tap water for 30 minutes before assembling the lasagna. It’s a great step saver, however, my cooked lasagna seemed a little “dry” because the noodles soaked up more liquids. Next time, I will increase the meat sauce to 2 cups per layer. So, this is how I divided the ingredients: 8 cups of meat sauce divided b 4; lasagna noodles divided by 3; ricotta mixture divided by 2; mozzarella slices divided by 3; grated parmesan cheese divided by 3. This is how I layered the pan starting with the bottom most layer and working to the top: meat sauce/noodles/ricotta/mozzarella/meat sauce/parm cheese/noodles/ricotta/mozzarella/meat sauce/parm cheese/noodles/meat sauce/mozzarella/parm cheese.","Great recipe, I'll be making this again and again. And finally, I found a lasagna that doesn't fall apart on a plate but isn't dry either! I read a lot of the reviews before deciding on how I was going to make this for the first time. I made the following changes: 1) used 1 lb of ground beef plus the sausage, 2) added a can crushed tomatoes to the sauce to make it a little heartier 3) substituted red wine for the water (wow did that improve the flavor!) 4) added only 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to the sauce 5) doubled the Italian Seasoning 6) omitted the fennel (don't like it) 7)used 1 lb of mozzarella cheese 8) added 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 8) cooked the noodles by placing them in hot water for 30 mins (worked well, they turn out perfect) 9) used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh stuff. The two things I wish I'd have known prior to making this: use the deepest dish you can find or you won't fit all the layers, and if you like the white cheezy part of the lasagna, you'll definitely need to double the ingredients for the ricotta cheese mixture. The recipe makes barely enough to fully cover my 9 X 13 dish. Hope this helps! Happy cooking!","I am going to write mt first review ever on this board, and it is for this recipe. I am from the mother country Italy, and this is the closest recipe to ones like home I have found. If you want to try a real italian lasagna, this is the one. The sauce is the key and would be great on anything. I added more garlic, but that was it. My family and friends thought this was a old secret family recipe. It is now and they will never know.","Absolutely the BEST lasagna I have ever made! Per others' suggestions, I made the following changes: 1) used brown suger instead of white 2) used fresh basil instead of dried 3) used red wine instead of water 4)didn't boil the noodles...just soaked them in hot water while the sauce was cooking. 5) added a couple dashes of nutmeg to the ricotta cheese mixture 6) used shredded mozarella instead of slices. This recipe makes A LOT of sauce. I had about 2 cups left over even after I was generous with it in my layering. My boyfriend LOVED it and said it's the best he's ever had. I didn't find it all that 'labor intensive' to make considering it is lasagna! Thanks for this recipe!","Believe it, everyone. This lasagna is amazing! I served it tonight to at a dinner party and all my guests raved and went back for seconds! I read all the reviews before I started cooking and here's what I did to the recipe to make it extra yummy - 1. I used a lb. of Italian sausage and 1 1/2 lbs. of lean ground beef. 2. I chopped a medium onion instead of using minced onion. 3. I used six cloves of garlic instead of two. 4. I used a 1/2 c. of red wine instead of water. 5. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. 6. I used fresh chopped basil and fresh chopped parsley instead of dried. 7. I used 1 teaspoon of salt. 8. I doubled the ricotta. 9. I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to my ricotta mixture. 10. I grated a lb. of mozzarella cheese instead of using sliced mozzarella. Even though this recipe is a little time consuming, it's absolutely worth it!! This is the only lasagna recipe I will ever use from now on!!","With all of the reviewers' suggestions, this recipe is definitely 5 star. As written, it could use a few improvements. Here is what I did (following others' suggestions in their reviews): - Soak noodles in very hot tap water for up to 30 mins while prepping sauce/ricotta mixture. - Use 1lb ground beef (they sell sweet Italian sausage at Trader Joe's, but I've used pork sausage with sweet chilis and that works, too). - Drain excess liquid after browning meat and before adding onions and garlic, then cook until onions are soft before adding the other ingredients to the sauce. - 6 cloves garlic instead of 2. - Only 6 oz tomato paste, instead of 12oz. - 1 Tablespoon of sugar instead of 2, and 1 teaspoon of salt (instead of 1 Tblsp). - 1/3 cup fresh basil instead of dried, if you have it (dried is fine otherwise). - 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. - Add 1 Tblsp parmesan and a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture. - I've used both sliced mozz and fresh mozz - both work great. - Layer as follows (from bottom to top): 2 c meat sauce / 6 noodles (overlap them) / 1/2 ricotta mixture / 2 c meat sauce / 1/4 c parmesan / 1/2 of the mozzarella / 2 c meat sauce / 6 noodles / remaining ricotta mixture / 2 c meat sauce / remaining mozzarella / remaining parmesan. - Cover and refrigerate overnight. - Let sit at room temp for an hour before baking. Everything else in the recipe that I haven't mentioned, I followed as written. The lasagna got rave reviews and disappeared","The very best I've ever made . . . with a few changes to the sauce - red wine instead of water, omit the sugar & salt & add 1/2 tsp cinnamon (from my Italian Nona). Save time & energy by replacing the cooked lasagna noodles with layers of uncooked won ton wrappers which are basically an uncooked noodle. No one will know the difference except to say how great it is because the noodles are not so thick.","Like many I have a very good lasagna recipe that I have used for years. Once in a while it's fun to change it up. I've tried a couple of the well rated others here but nothing was a great improvement over mine. I had thought this recipe was one I had tried, but it wasn't. This is simply fabulous. The sausage is wonderful in the sauce, subtle but noticeable. The fennel is another added flavour hint making the sauce taste homemade and unique. I like everything as is but do agree that the salt could be cut. I must commend the reviewers who explained how to build 3 layers. Now why didn't I think of that?? Liking the taste of regular lasagna pasta noodles over ""oven ready"" I have been using the soak in hot water method for a long time and would never do it any other way. Thanks so much for this wonderful addition to my menu","This was excellent and the sauce had a wonderful flavor! I mostly stuck to the recipe, except it calls for way too much salt. I only used one tsp. Also, when layering the lasagna, you need three layers of noodles (4 ea) to fit the divided ricotta mixture in between. 2 layers wouldn't even work. I used 1/4 of the sauce on the bottom, in between the layers and on top. These are very small changes about only the salt and assembly which I feel are mistakes in the recipe. Also, an ordinary, shallow 13x9 pan would be too small for this. I used a spacious lasagna pan. Thanks for the recipe!","This was awesome. I will only make lasagna this way from now on. Not that my dad's wasn't the best and he is from Italy but this is the recipe I will hand down to my kids. I only made a couple changes and they weren't even that big. I used about 1.4 lbs of meat and I used 1.25 lbs of sweet italian sausage and instead of 28oz of crushed tomatoes I used 14oz and used 14 oz of diced italian tomatoes seasoned with garlic, basil, and oregano. I made the night before so the flavors could marry and used no boil noodles. This is def traditional italian lasagna. Nothing american about this one. It's a must try.UPDATE The no boil noodles didn't work out so well. Just use traditional noodles and use the method of soaking them in hot water for 30 min. Works for me everytime. I also only added 1 tsp of kosher salt and not a tbl, I also added about a half a palm full of crushed red pepper flakes about a tsp to offset the sweetness. My kiddos and husband can't get enough of this. This is def money. Also the secret italian thing is to add a pinch of nutmeg to any sauce and it makes it pop. Why I don't know but my dad taught me and it has never failed me.","I have been on a long search and agree this is the best lasagna I have found. The sauce is fantastic, which is a big compliment from me as I'm very picky about my sauce. I read a lot of other people's comments. At the end of the day, I made the recipe as written except that I omitted the salt, use 1.25 pounds of ground beef, spicy italian sausage instead of sweet, and used only half the ricotta. How much ricotta you use is really up to personal taste. My view is a little goes a long ways. Several people mentioned doing it in three layers instead of two, but two took it up to the very top of the pan anyway. This recipe is great!","This is almost my exact recipe for lasagne - except I like to use hot italian sausage and add some chopped mushrooms to the sauce while it is simmering. A dash or two of a good red wine to the sauce isn't a bad addition either. This is an absolutely wonderful dish - a little time consuming, but worth every minute!!","No question this is an outstanding lasagna. I have had lasagna quite a lot in my life and this one is at the top. The secret, or not so secret, to this recipe is the sauce. I also love love love a good chicken parm and this will be the sauce I will use for my chicken parm from now on. I did make a couple changes that I don't think changed anything. One, reduce the salt content...it calls for too much. Two, use fresh herbs it worth the extra $. In building the lasagna, I tried to slash out some of the fat. It wouldn't be the same with any other meat than is called for so I went after the cheese to reduce the fat and cholesterol. I used non-fat ricotta cheese and lower fat mozz. I still went with the regular parmigiana cheese, however. Other than that I went with the recipe which I almost never do. Give this one a try if you like good dishes like this.","This recipie was time consuming but easy enough. I was so pleased with it - my husband and I were so busy gobbling it up that I forgot to serve the garlic bread that I had made. My 14 month old was just shoveling it in, going ""yum, yum."" :) Somewhere along the line, it ended up too salty, so I would adjust that. I used the oven ready lasagna noodles. Sauce would be excellent just over pasta. Couldn't stop stealing some as it was simmering! Am afraid to make this for my Mom - don't want to hurt her feelings - she's worked a long time perfecting hers, but WOW this one was better than Mom's. Thanks for the recipie!","THE REVIEWS ARE RIGHT! They all have good hints. 1. Soak the noodles for 20 minutes instead of boiling. 2. Omit the sugar and salt: the sausage has tons of salt/sugar as well as the tomato products and most of the reviews that were negative said that it was too salty or sweet 3. I used fresh herbs and LOTS of them including fresh marjoram and tripled the garlic (some of the bad reviews said it was bland so add what you usually like!). 4. Turn that water into red wine!!! 5. Add nutmeg to the ricotta mixture, I used lots of freshly ground nutmeg 6. MAKE TWO DISHES! You're going to be in the kitchen for a while, just double the recipe and freeze the extra one! I took care of 2 birthday parties with one stone so to speak... and EVERYONE RAVED!!!!!! This is not a light lasagna, I served a little portion with lots of steamed asparagus and a light salad (spinach with pomegranate seeds and goat cheese with champagne vinaigrette).",Too much Tomato Paste for amount of liquid. Bring to a boil impossible without burning. Saved it by dumping a lot of red wine and some water in. Drank rest of red wine and felt better.,"The secret is the Italian sausage. It really makes the lasagna so much better than the basic hamburger version. Freeze half uncooked for later, you'll crave it again in about a week.","I must comment on the reactions to the sugar in the sauce...the purpose of the sugar is to counter the bitter back taste of the various tomato products & not to sweeten it. Whenever I make a tomato sauce I taste and determine the amount of sugar needed usually it's about a tsp. I personally have never had to use that much sugar. Obviously the salt was a typo as many have stated, that much salt would give me a stroke. tip: In a small sautee pan put 2 or 3 Tb of olive oil and fresh minced garlic amount according to personal preference. (My family loves garlic so I use approx. 4 to 6 cloves and put it through a garlic press or simply smash) To this I add finely chopped onion, when the onion is tender I add all the seasonings minus the salt and seasonings are quite personal and differ as do people so use what you love, we like a little kick and use red pepper flakes. Turn down the temperature to low after it sizzles, put a lid on and allow to simmer. This is an important step as it infuses the flavors into the scant 'heart healthy' olive oil. Meanwhile cook and crumble desired meats. Lightly SALT your meat but not the sausage! Set aside. (drain the excess oil from the meat). NOTE a very small amount of salt brings out the flavor of your meats. The sauce however,should not be salted. I enjoy the Hunts flavored sauces and sometime will use their spaghetti sauce as a starter for my sauce only because it expedites time. Combine your sauce, meat and sauteed season., simmer/assemble.","It is truely wonderful, except.....WAY TOO MUCH SALT! I made the recipe to the chef's specifications. I give it 5 stars, because it is awesome, but will omit the salt. The canned items and the sausage give it plenty.","Made this last night and thought it was horrible! Way too salty and I love salt! I will go back to my regular sauce of 1 large can (28 oz) crushed tomatos and 1 can diced tomatos 3 Tbsp EVOO, 3 cloves garlic, basil, oregano and Tbsp sugar. I'm not sure what went wrong with this except perhaps the salt content in the tomato sauce was high and that threw the whole thing off. My family ate it but asked for me to go back to the regular sauce recipe for next time. It did hold together good and the sliced mozza is a great idea. Also placing the noodles in a casserole pan and soaking in boiling water works very well even with rice pasta, which I have to substitute due to my wheat gluten allergy.",Really the best!!! The only one that is truly like my grandmother's. The combination of ground beef AND sausage can't be beat!,THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS LASAGNA I HAVE EVER EATEN...TIME CONSUMING BUT WORTH IT !!!,"Not easy, not quick. But oh, it is sooooo worth the wait and the work. I used turkey Italian sausage to cut out some fat, and it was great.","This is a great recipe, but it's a rip off of The New McCall's Cook Book (1973)","This lasagna is great and the sauce itself is awesome too. My husband told me that this sauce is better that the one I usually make and that one was from his mother’s recipe. This recipe makes a little more sauce that you need so I use the leftover for some pasta or ravioli few days later. I followed some suggestions from the previous reviews and from making this recipe few times here are some things I changed. *Used 1lb each of beef and Italian sausage *Used less salt (only about a teaspoon) *Used only 1 tablespoon of sugar in the sauce *Used wine instead of water *Used fresh chopped basil instead of dry (about ½ cup) *Used “ready to bake” lasagna noodles *Used fresh deli grade ricotta cheese not the processed stuff from the container *Used freshly grated Parmesan cheese This is a 5 start lasagna recipe that it better than the one you order in the restaurant!! I often add spinach (fresh spinach wilted with some butter) to the ricotta cheese and it tastes great. Remember to always use as much fresh ingredients as you can – you will taste the difference (fresh ricotta and Parmesan, add fresh parsley and basil etc) Enjoy! Also, make the sauce a day earlier to save time.","This Lasanga is delicious. I used this recipe the first time I made lasanga, and I will probably never try another recipe. People beg for me to make it...",,,,,,
1,I grew up on this casserole. I have made it dozens and dozens of time for my own family. Modifications .... for sure.....I added a thinly sliced onion when browning the mushrooms. I make a roux with butter and flour (I like my flour to have that nice nutty flavour that it gets when you make a roux) that step really amps up the dish. Also deglaze your fry pan with 1/2 cup of white wine and then pop the entire meal into the oven and cook on 325 for an hour. Fall off the bone tasty.,"Delicious as written! My chops were thick so I did have to cook them longer but this is an excellent recipe. With the exception of bacon, pork is my least favorite meat so for me to give 5 stars for pork says a lot.","This recipe is very good. I added fresh Italian parsley for color and a bit of mild flavor. It is pretty easy and tasty. Just boil some potatoes and serve with the sauce. This is a truly delicious dinner. I think dried or fresh thyme could be used and will be just as awesome as it it. Will make it again. Have some crusty bread to eat the remnants of sauce. Update: If you want to add some richness and body to the sauce, before adding the garlic and mushrooms, try this: add about 2tsps of white wine, deglaze the pan, and let the wine dissipate before adding the garlic and mushrooms. Yum!","Made it twice. First as directed above. The second time I used portobello mushrooms and added red onions and halved the broth amount and added white wine for the other half, and it was amazing!!!!","KEEPER! We can't wait to have this again! Just follow the recipe and you'll be happy! I did add about another 1 1/2 teaspoons of flour to the mix, but that's all I did. This is really good! Thanks, April!",I’m new to cooking and made a couple mistakes but oh man this was an amazing recipe!,"Thank you for sharing this recipe! I am always on the lookout for quick and simple recipes and this one definitely fit the bill. I made mine with 4 thin, boneless pork chops and I only added 2 cloves of garlic. I also added a small chopped Vidalia onion and man was it delicious!! My husband spooned the extra gravy over 2 grands biscuits because he liked it so much. I will most definitely make this again and plan to share it with my daughter and daughter in law.","Holy Hannah this was awe-some!! I made the recipe mostly as-is, with the exception I didn't have beef broth so I used Campbell's beef consume, it was delish. I also used baby portabello mushrooms, talk about visually appealing! ?I would cook noodles or rice to serve this on.","This turned out very nicely. The only change I made was with the mustard. I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard. The pork chops were very tender, and the sauce/gravy was delicious. The only thing I might add is onions with the mushrooms and garlic.",Made for my husband birthday dinner and he loves it!. Thank you Allrecipes,"Don't know, exactly, what I expected from this recipe, but I was a bit disappointed in it. Tasted ""ok"", at best, with me adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder- repeatedly. My husband liked it....... Guess I was expecting more with the recipe note that it was close to one served to the author, at a restaurant. Probability of making it again, are slim.",This. Is. So. Good. Highly recommend.,The taste was very enjoyable and the recipe was easy and simple to prepare.,I doubled up on the mushrooms but stuck to the recipe outside of that. The whole family loved this.,No changes and will definitely make it again.,"I always add wine of some sort, white , sherry, or even red ! fourth cup is good. Yummy gravy","excellent but as just for me for a couple of meals, cut the pork in half and kept the mushrooms the same as I love them.","This recipe was easier to make than I thought it would be, and tasted great. No leftovers. I’m not a fan of pork chops, but I get them when on sale. This is a keeper, thank you!",I followed exact directions and it was delicious everyone loves it. I had scallop home made potato’s with it and was great with the gravy!,It is the second time I do it and it is always a success!,it came out very good and it was easy to follow. Had some left over for lunch the day after and it was even better.,"Didn’t take a picture.... but I’ll be making this again and again! As someone recommended, I added sliced onion rings when I added the mushrooms! So so good!","My sauce turned out a little thicker, but my family loved it! Thank you! Very yummy!",Wonderfully browned in butter. Good gravy. Made enough for a leftover. Very tender.,"I made this exactly as the recipe says to, except I used a little wine with the mushrooms. I also put the dish ( covered in foil), in the oven @350 for 30 minutes. It was so tender & delicious! I will make this again & again!","Too much paprika for me, other than that it was delicious",This was an easy inexpensive meal. I know how to make gravy but the beef broth took it to a whole nother level. Will make again for sure!!,"I had to use 2 pans bc my family is big. I used EVOO for one and butter for the other. Definitely will use butter as it made for a better crust with butter. So flavorful, and I used a lot more garlic as we love garlic! Will be making this again!!",Really good without altering the recipe.,No changes have made it twice.,Very yummy! I made double the sauce but it was not necessary. 50% more would have been sufficient,"Great recipe; it also works with chicken cutlets and chicken broth. Serve with noodles, rice or mashed potatoes as the sauce is delicious. Like others, I usually add some onion or shallot with the mushrooms, and sub wine (up to 1/2 cup) for some of the broth. Definitely a keeper!",It's one of our go-tos for pork chops.,Followed the recipe exactly.....with a picky husband and girls....there was nothing left! We will definitely be enjoying this again soon.,This was very good. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I am making another batch this weekend of just the cause. I have a bunch of chicken I need to use. This is so easy and inexpensive to make.,,,,,,,,,
2,"This one is a ""keeper""! My husband said he'd like it again! This stroganoff was different than the tomato-based one that I usually make, and we loved it! It has a hearty, rich flavor. I didn't have to adjust any of the seasoning, and the thickness was perfect, which doesn't always happen in a crock-pot recipe. I had all of the ingredients, and didn't change a thing. Looking forward to more recipes from Ann. Thanks, Ann!","I should probably start off by saying that stroganoff is one of my favorite meals but I'm pretty picky about it. I looked through this website for a while looking for a recipe that looked good and not too complicated. This was the perfect sunday recipe, just layer and let it go for a few hours. I wasn't sure what wine to use so I just used the cabernet sauvignon I had on hand. I did follow the recipe except two small changes. When I was putting salt and pepper on the stew meat I also added a bit of paprika. I also could not find dried chives so I just left them out. I think the way it was written the recipe is great, but it came out delicious my way too. None of the changes were very large. I just have a few things to point out. 1) warm the cream cheese up to room temperature to let it soften and consider breaking it into small chunks. 2) a tablespoon of paprika really adds some nice flavor to red meat dishes. 3) I really like a savory flavor so I might double the Worcestershire sauce the next time I make this. This recipe is definitely a keeper too. Satisfying, and quite simple but also I believe it is a bit healthier than some of the other recipes I have seen. Update: I’ve made this recipe many times now. Everyone I’ve fed it to loves it. I do add the paprika, and double the Worcestershire sauce. I add chives when I have them but that isn’t a deal breaker to me. This is one of my favorite recipes to come home to after a long day.","I can't tell you how appreciative I am that pretty much all of you, save a few, love my stroganoff. I get excited every time I get notification that someone else has posted a review. I wish you all a very happy, safe, healthy, & prosperous new year!",This was wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the red wine because I didn't have any. Used water instead. I found that the sauce was a little thick but maybe some of the moisture cooked away. Will watch and maybe add some additional water next time. Flavor was fabulous! My guests loved it!! Will certainly make again. Thanks!,"L O VE D this recipe. Family is of German descent and everyone loved it. Stroganoff should be more than beef and gravy enhanced with sour cream..this truly is! Made to the recipe for a double recipe and a single recipe leaving out onions and chives. Truly didn't make a lot of difference. The red wine was the answer to a full flavor! Awesome ,.. This will be my GO TO stroganoff from now on! Thanks","I'll be honest, I have NEVER rated a recipe before online, but this was absolutely too fantastic not to rate! The only thing I added, which probably wasn't necessary, but I did anyway, was added about 3/4 can of Golden Mushroom soup. This recipe is definitely the one and only crockpot/slow cooker beef stroganoff that we will use over and over again! Thank you for posting this masterpiece!!","Recipe was delicious! Made a few modifications. Used trader joe's cream of mushroom soup and sautéed mushrooms, onions and garlic in butter, then added red wine and reduced until thickened. Still added red wine called for in recipe to stroganoff sauce. Best stroganoff I've ever made....thank you cwmom98.","This was okay, but I guess I was expecting more, considering all the ingredients that went into. However, I did make the mistake of adding 1/3 too much sour cream because I read the directions wrongly. Then when I taste-tested it, I found it to be quite bland, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon of extra worchestershire sauce. In the end, it still didn't have quite as much flavor as I was hoping it would. I think I'll go back to my much more simple and much more flavorful stroganoff recipe, which is basically just some sour cream mixed with a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.","The Wine, Cream Cheese, and Chives really set the recipe apart from the meager fare so often associated with an easy dish. This is worth keeping, and really enjoy it!","Instead of using mushroom soup, I used Golden Mushroom. Otherwise, I followed this recipe to a T. By far, the best Stroganoff I have ever had. It was, well, super duper. :-)","This is an absolutely fantastic recipe. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful. If you have time, there are a few things you can do to make it even better. I seared the cubes of chuck in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a bit of vegetable oil until each piece had a nice brown crust (Don't buy ""stew meat"" in the package if it's more expensive per pound than a chuck roast, it only takes a few minutes to trim and cube it yourself.) I transferred the browned meat to the slow cooker and reduced the heat to medium. I tossed in a couple tablespoons of butter and added the onions and a pinch of salt. Once the onions are soft and taking on some color, I tossed in the mushrooms and cooked them until they release their moisture and then get nicely browned. I then deglazed pan with the wine, and poured the mushrooms, onions, and wine to the cooker. The only other change I made was mixing the cornstarch and flour with water instead of the wine, since I used the wine for deglazing the pan. The result was even better than the first time I made it, so the extra steps are worth it, but this is super delicious if you just throw everything in the slow cooker. I served this mixed with some old-fashioned egg noodles, and it was to die for!","This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and both stepkids and husband loved it. Do yourself a favor and don't deviate from the recipe-- there's no need to! When I make this again I will double the recipe, as everyone was fighting over the small portion of what was left over. :-)",Very good! Thank you! I did increase the amount of meat and used sirloin. Baby Bella’s are amazing in this dish! Even better the next day.,"Made this last night. My husband actually stopped eating to look at me and say, ""This is REALLY good. Thank you!"" So we will definitely have this again. Great recipe, thank you for sharing it.",I made this exactly as described and we loved it. Next time I will double the recipe so there is more leftovers.,"Very good, I would like to see something other than canned soup used, but otherwise good","Very good! Beef was tender, sauce was super creamy, and the wine and worcestershire sauce added a well-rounded flavor. I even screwed up and cooked on high for 7 hours and it still turned out GREAT! Served over egg noodles. Yummy!",No mushrooms . No wine I use beef broth,"Spectacular. Made it just as the recipe said and it was phenomenal, full of flavor, beef was perfectly cooked, creamy and thick sauce. Just awesome! Thank you!!","Fantastic dish, juicy tender beef with a rich, creamy, complex sauce. Don't change a thing, excellent recipe just as it is. Thank you from the bottom of my taste buds. I will definitely be adding this to repertoire of winter comfort food meals.",Loved it.,"My family honestly did not like it. I don’t know if it was the wine, the sour cream or both, but I won’t be using this recipe again. Sorry!","Fabulous recipe! I paired it with an Old World French Bread. Amazing dinner! I may leave the parsley out next time, not a huge fan. I also used Oak Leaf Brand Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine.","Turned out great! I made it exactly as stated, but I did add a dash of paprika out of curiosity from the other reviews. Did 6 hours on low and cranked it up to high after I added the other ingredients for the 7th hour as I was hungry and impatient. Meat was tender and the flavors were developed. Will definitely make again!","I think it could have used more meat. The sauce to meat ratio was off. I'd probably put 2-2.5 lbs. in next time. Also, I didn't have red wine so I used a half cup of cranberry juice with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and it tasted great.","This recipe, as written, is delicious! Dummy here forgot to add the parsley at the end but it didn't detract any from the flavor. So I have a nice bunch of fresh parsley hanging out in the fridge... maybe I'll dress up the oven roasted potatoes I'm making tonight with them. Great job cwmom98! :)",This works quite well. Follow the recipe. Tastes fantastic. Don't forget the sour cream,"No. I followed this recipe step by step. My 2 girls loved it. Just to show off, I even had my soon to be ex-wife over for dinner. She's gonna miss me and my cooking. This was a perfect dinner on this winter day.","I used Sherry instead of Red Wine as that it what I had on hand. I also forgot to whisk the corn starch and flour into the Sherry, but it turned out fine. Flavors were amazing, prep was relatively easy. Will definitely be making this one on a regular basis.",This was great! I swapped out the condensed cream of mushroom soup for golden mushroom soup. I also used beef stock instead of water. Everything else I kept the same.,I used Sirloin...cleaning out my freezer. Will make it again.,"Every recipe needs tweeting according to personal taste. That said, it was decent, but unless you ""need to use a slow cooker""...cook it classic stove top...subsitute ""plain cream cheese with ""cream cheese and chive flavor...for more intense flavor instead of chives.","I love stroganoff and this was lovely. I like a really tangy stroganoff and add some finely diced gherkins and green peppercorns, but as it is it's a winner.","As always my husband said, ""the meat has no flavor."" So I said, ""that is what the yummy sauce is for!!"" I thought this this was delicious and will make again.","Delicious, richly flavored beef stroganoff!",I added frozen peas about 30 minutes before it was done. This was enough for about 5 meals for me. I froze some for later. Sometimes I pour this over rice.,Sooo good!,"Just made this tonight! It was very good however both my husband and I agreed, a sirloin would have been better. We weren't huge fans of the stew meat.",,,,,,
3,This works well for certain ovens. Here is the fool proof plan! After your calculated 500 degree blast turn off the oven. In 30 minutes check the oven temp by setting it to bake at 325 degrees. If your oven is below 325 and begins to heat up your oven either has a vent fan or cools off too quickly. No problem. Set it to 275 and leave it for the next hour. You are now at 1.5 hours after the blast. Turn oven off for the last half hour. Perfection. If your oven is over 325 one half hour after the first half hour blast you should be good with original recipe.,"This is a fool proof method for making the best medium rare prime rib. Your seasonings can be changed according to your preference, but what's listed works perfectly. It's the cooking method that is the key. It cannot be stressed enough, the roast MUST be at room temperature in order for this to work. If it is the least bit cold in the middle of the roast, you will come out with a very rare roast. A mistake I only made once because I was worried about leaving it out to get warm. Don't worry! It will be fine! I usually purchase 4.5 to 5 lb roasts and take it out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to be sure it is room temp. It comes out absolutely PERFECT and juicy every time.","I know this is a culinary no-no, but we don't link pink meat, so while I partially use this method, I didn't do it exactly as Chef John suggests. I had a 4 lb boneless rib roast, which I let sit out at room temp for 4 hours. While the meat was coming to room temp I also let my butter sit out to soften. I placed the butter in a small bowl, added about 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, 4 tsp of coarse kosher salt, 2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 6 minced garlic cloves, and 2 tsp of thyme. (We don't care for Herbs de Provence.) I mixed this up with a fork then slathered the meat all over with it. I roasted the meat for 20 minutes at 500 degrees to get a nice crust, then I reduced the oven temp to 325 and continued roasting for another two hours. This gave us meat which was almost well done. It was still absolutely delicious this way, and perfectly flavored and juicy. Served with some twice baked potatoes and green beans. Perfect meal!","I have used this recipe for years and it works perfectly- ONE THING that will cause the meat to be less than medium rare, besides not having the rib at room temperature, is the fan in newer ovens!! I had no issue for many years until I got a new oven in 2012. Many new ovens have a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off. It quickly lowers the temp, which, obviously, will not work for this recipe. Since I have a built-in oven, I actually shut off the breaker to the oven so the fan doesn't come on. Otherwise you can just unplug it. I guarantee that was the problem with folks who had theirs come out rare!","I was really skeptical - I'm a thermometer checker with my meats and keeping the oven off for two hours with the door closed about killed me! I had a 7 pound prime rib roast and with the exception of the seasoning (I make my own), I followed the recipe exactly as written - roasting at 500 degrees for 35 minutes and then oven off for 2 hours. Turned out perfect. My husband was beyond impressed. I also made Chef John's Beef Au Jus. A meal my entire family loved. Thank you!","I wish there was an ability to give 10 stars! Chef John, I followed your directions... (except I was all out of Kosher salt so I only used sea salt, dang it)...and I got rave reviews. Due to having big eaters and more people than normal, I made an 11.13 pound rib roast and the directions worked for that big of an item. I couldn't believe it. Thank you so much. I have deleted the other prime/rib roast from my recipe box and now only have yours. Words cannot express my gratitude.","Absolutely, the easiest way to make perfect prime rib every time. But do not be tempted to open up the oven door until time is up.","OMG .. I have never been able to do Prime Rib correctly and I finally cracked it using this recipe. Thank you thank you thank you! The only alteration I made was to do the math (# of lbs by 5 mins per lb) and then I added about 5 extra minutes to the total time (ie my roast needed 19.5 mins in the 500 F oven, and I did it for 25 mins) this was simply because I wanted some meat on the outside edge closer to medium (for me) and medium rare inside for hubby. The plan worked to perfection and gave us exactly what we wanted for a fantastic New Years Eve dinner. I have never been a huge fan of prime rib and this recipe has won me over. I'll prepare this again and again, a big hit! (I might cut back on the pepper next time, but this wasn't a huge issue, just personal preference I also made Chef John's Au Jus to go with this and it was incredible; like liquid gold as my husband said! )","Prime rib was perfect, juicy and perfectly pink. Followed the recipe exactly with a 4 lb prime rib. Loved it! Love the video to really get a good sense of how to apply the butter and herbs. I'll be trying more of your recipes in the near future for sure!","I've never written a review here before, but I just had to for this. Today I cooked a 6.2 lb rib and it was perfect. The only thing different that I did was to use fresh Rosemary and Thyme, minced, and 10 cloves of garlic, minced, in the butter. I didn't have Herbs de Provence, and did have the fresh herbs, so that's what I used. I'd seen the garlic idea from the Garlic Prime Rib recipe on this website. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly! We do a rib for Christmas every year and before, it was a shoot, it seemed, as to whether the roast would come out medium rare or too done. This recipe has changed that for good!! The hardest part was not opening the door until the 2 hours was done. Otherwise, it was easy peasy! And SO good. I've attached a picture. Thank you so much for giving us a foolproof way to perfectly cook a standing rib! As a few others have said, I'd give it more stars if I could.","UPDATE: Christmas 2019 and I'm trying this method in a brand new oven. I forgot to disable my smoke detectors, but the brand new oven door is sealed well. Still do not have a high-temp meat thermometer but again, with a brand new oven, 500 should be true. My roast was 4.03lbs so 21 minutes then 2hrs in 'off' oven. The roast is perfect!","Love this recipe. But, I need such a big roast that I'm using two in the same oven. Does anyone know if I'm to use the roast time formula for just one of the two (they're both approximately same weight)?","I made this recipe last night for our Christmas Eve dinner. I must say that I was extremely nervous because I prepared a 14.7 pound 5 rib roast! Even though the recipe claims that the ""math"" is the trick, I was concerned that putting my roast in for 74 minutes at 500 was going to burn the outside. Well, just to let you all know, it was perfect! I was amazed! My family was definitely enjoying the meal. Thank you for making me look like a pro. :)","I had a great result. Preheated to 500...(hint to the one that complained of a smoking oven, a clean oven should prevent this, I learned the hard way lol.) My roast was exactly 5 lbs. 5x5=25 and I added 5 minutes to err to the side of caution. Solid 2 hours later, removed from oven, set aside and lightly covered in foil while I made the ""jus"" that he also has a recipe for here. The meat was a perfect tender pink throughout and just delicious. The jus took it over the top. This was my first prime rib but it sure won't be my last. I couldn't have asked for a better result.","This is a perfect recipe. My roast was almost 8# bone in....I stuck slivers of garlic in the top, rubbed it with soft butter, crushed garlic & rosemary....then topped that with kosher salt! I will never cook this any other way!","We just did 3 18 lb standing rib roasts for a catering gig and people couldn't say enough positive things about this. Used my secret blend of spices but followed roasting directions and was the most tender, moist, evenly coked medium rare prime I have done in ages. Was a little afraid that wouldn't work with roasts this size, but a dream! Thanks, Chef John, you saved my bacon!","My family celebrated Thanksgiving with my wife's sister, while I shivered and shook with with some kind of crud. On Friday I followed the recipe and technique and was able to present a very good prime rib for the family. Our oven is a good gas unit and the meet was a bit undercooked for all but me. The next time I will increase the minutes at 500 degrees and make some changes in the seasoning. Tonight the leftover roast is simmering in the stock pot with potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and onions for a great beef stew for the family.","Our family actually learned this same method of cooking prime rib at 500 degrees, multiplying the weight by 5 for the minutes to cook, etc. from our butcher in Indiana back in the 1980s. Needless to say, this method has been around a while. This recipe never fails and has served us well with Prime Rib for over twenty years...it's amazingly accurate and delicious.","I would truly love to give this the 5 Star Rating I was expecting to give when placing my two 8# roasts in the oven on Christmas Day. Unfortunately after the 2 hours we pretty much had raw beef on our plates. The flavor was great (I knew enough not to attempt butter at such a high temp for that long) and there was plenty of salt/seasoning adhering to the roasts so that wasn't a concern. The Au Jus turned out too salty ~ I wish I'd thought to use some wine to mellow it out before serving although noone other than myself seemed to think it was salty. I can only conclude that the meat must have NOT been as room temperature as I thought it was after hours of sitting out. I will make it a point of trying this method again with another rib roast and plug in a remote reader digital thermometer to watch the interior temp during that 2 hours. Good excuse for making another roast for my birthday, right? In our house, we choose our special dinner entree (or restaurant...) hee...hee.... I'd love to be able to revise this rating with a 5. I'm giving it a 4 only because I'm assuming it was something I did that kept it so rare. Chef John, if you have any comments about roasting 2 separate same weight cuts of roast at the same time, please let me know. There was enough separation between them to allow for heat circulation ~ I'm just stumped.",I was really nervous making this. First time I tried to make prime rib a few years ago using a thermometer I ruined a 143.00 rib roast. ( over cooked) so I watched Chef Johns video and printed out the recipe and proceeded to follow it to the letter. This was AMAZING!!!! I could not believe how great this was. My mother loved it. My daughter and her fiancé really enjoyed it too. Thank you so Much Chef John you've just gotten yourself another fan. I let the roast sit out for 6 hrs as suggested. And did the math for a roast that was 9.22 lbs. the hardest part was not opening the oven door. What a great way to make the perfect rib roast.. I did pull it out 15 min earlier because it was a big roast and was afraid if the bones got to hot might over cook. It was perfect. Pink moist and delicious. Also made the beef au jus from his other video. So easy and made me feel like a culinary king.. Thanks again Chef John...,"I tried this recipe on Xmas Day 4 years ago after I read a dozen reviews so I made a couple of adjustments. First, I did leave my roast out of the refrig for 6 hours before I cooked it. Take your roast out at 9:30AM, wait 6 hours. I started cooking at 4PM for a 7 lb 1 oz roast (bone in) that I ran longer than the prescribed time. The calculation would have dictated 35 minutes at 500 degrees, I added 4 minutes for a total of 39 minutes and it came out a PERFECT MEDIUM (hot pink, very slight red center, with the outside being close to well done but nice and crisp). Roast was on the table at 6:45PM. During the afternoon I prepped the rest of my meal easily. For me, I have now used this 4 more times since then as of Dec 1, 2017 with the following formula: 5.3 minutes for every pound of meat (bone in). I have gotten a perfect hot light red/pink center with no blood every time (now 5 times). Perfect outside color and even a bit warm when served after sitting 2-3 minutes before carving. I have roasted sizes between 5.6 lbs through 8.4 lbs without a problem - can't speak for anything smaller or larger than this size. You MUST get your roast to room temperature before cooling for this timing and oven setting to work. Also, if you don't watch the video, roast your meat with the ""bones down"" so the top fat layer crusts and gets crispy because it is exposed to the searing of your hot oven elements. I hope this refinement of the recipe helps people avoid the undercooking that","Ok I had a 20.14 lb prime rib big one I was so worried. I followed the receipt along with the seasoning and cook time, yes had to do some math to figure it out 1hr and 30min in the oven at 500° shut it off and did not open till 2 hrs 30 min, yes house filled up with smoke had to disable the fire alarms. Prime rib came out perfect so delicious and medium rare. Rave reviews I had to share.","This is a great recipe....and I love the method. I used some crushed garlic in my butter compound and also added a bit of olive oil to bring up the smokepoint. At 500 degrees, butter smokes in my oven....but it is a bearable amount and if you have good ventilation, the results are well worth it! Because I have a smaller electric oven, it cools a bit too quickly for this recipe. (which I knew going into it and the Chef's instructions are quite clear about a full size oven). After my sear time of 5 minutes a pound, I reduced the cooking temp to 250 degrees. Since I did not turn the oven off completley, I also let it rest about 20 minutes before carving. I took a nine pound roast out at 134 degrees and it rose to 136 over about 20 minutes. Meat was perfect. Great recipe and easy to make!","Despite being skeptical, I made this for Christmas Dinner. I put a rub of butter and Montreal Steaak Seasoning instead of Herbs de Provance. 4.5 roast, 22 minutes at 500, then l hr and 40 minutes until the therm. read 130. I took it out then as I didn't want to overcook it. It was perfect. I had enough drippings to make a thin gravy. I let it sit out overnight and the internal temperature was 63. I put bunjie cords on the oven door so I didn't open it by mistake. It was amazing to me that the meat actually cooked with the oven off. It was beautifully pink. I will use this recipe from now on. I can always rely on a recipe from Chef John.","This 78-year old (79 in eleven more days!) cook has made many rib roasts in her day. This is the third time I have used Chef John's fail-proof method for preparing a rib roast and every one (from 3-6 lbs.) has been PERFECT. I have been a bit more adventurous with my seasonings than the recipe calls for and the taste has been miraculous! My almost 75-year husband thinks he has died and gone to heaven each time I've made this meal! But it is the 5-minute per pound rule that is priceless! There is absolutely NO guess work, you don't need a meat thermometer and the results are great each time. I will never again make a prime rib with any other method!!!! Thank you so much, Chef John, for this recipe and the many other recipes that I've ""borrowed"" from you. You make me look good in the cooking department!! (People seem to think I can cook!) ;-)","I really wanted to love this. I followed the recipe to the letter. Like another reviewer experienced, my smoke alarms went off which always scares all of us. (Especially the dogs with their super hearing) After 2 hours when I took it out, it was way, WAY too rare. The only part that was cooked was the outside of it. It also still had that wiggly consistency. Had to cook it again the next day. Was really awful, and we both like rare-ish roast beef! Will never make this recipe again. Sorry Chef. Just wasn't edible to us and creeped me out looking at it.",First time I didn't have to worry about a thing! Perfect!! Thank you Chef John!!,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!! As many other reviewers, I was also nervous. I did however keep a meat thermometer in it while in the oven....one that has a cord to outside the oven so you can read the temp! And I let it get to 120 and took it out of the oven. So it was rare, instead of medium rare. Served it with his recipe for au jus! YUM!!! Prime rib is at a local grocer now due to Easter. I will be going back and getting another to make this recipe again! AWESOME! And I did find Herbs du Provence too! YAY! Everyone loved it!!! It is foolproof!!!","It was flavorful and tender- but it can't be emphasized enough that this will not work unless you bring the roast to room temperature. I ended up with an extremely rare roast that was cold on the inside- I love rare but I definitely don't like cold meat! My guests wanted medium rare and it was a hassle trying to microwave everyone's plates- plus it ruins the beef. Also, I am very reluctant to leave any meat sitting on the counter until it is room temperature. In summary, great taste but does not cook as presented in the recipe unless you warm the meat first- and you do that at your own risk.","Perfect, and so easy. Echoing other posters, do not open the oven, not even just a tiny crack. Highly recomend watching the video; even though the recipe is simple, there are a some very helpful hints (such as the salt...) I used pepper and rosemary in the rub. My roast was still a tiny bit frozen in the center, so I increased cooking time by 10% (33 minutes vs 30) and that did the trick. Also made Chef John's au jus which is simple and very delicious. Thanks, John for a wonderful Christmas Eve meal!","This recipe has totaly become a staple in our household and has a place on our Christmas table. I do have to admit, I was terrified the first time I cooked it. But as long as you follow his instruction to a t, yours will come out perfect like mine did.","This recipe is all about the method. If you don't like the salt, butter, etc., season it the way you want. But if you want a perfectly cooked prime rib...follow this method. I've cooked our Christmas Eve Prime Rib four times, and this method worked best for me. Also, note: the same method works no matter the size of the roast. I usually cook for 20-25 people so I use the full rib roast - 16 to 18 lbs. Multiply by 5 and I'm putting that baby in a 500 degree oven for 80 to 90 minutes! Also...very important. Getting the roast down to room temperature is crucial for this to work! Seems weird to have a slab of meat just sitting on the counter for 4 to 6 hours, but you have to get the internal temperature to a good starting point. Don't worry, it won't go bad.",I have a new Electrolux Induction stove w/convection oven and I guess it's better insulated than most because I had to pull the roast out at 1:15. when it had already hit 135 degrees and was climbing. Instead of medium rare the prime rib was medium well / well done.,"Thank You Chef John, I' m so impressed! I made a Standing Rib Roast (4 bone - small end) according to your recipe for Christmas Eve and my Husband is still raving about it! When we sliced the roast my guests ooh'd and ahh'd then proceeded to devour it and raved about how tender and juicy it was. I was a little aprehensive not only about cooking the roast for the such a short period of time (7.59 lb. roast - 38 minutes @ 500 degrees) then turning the oven off, but by also leaving the roast at room temperature for 6 hrs prior to cooking. (A must!!) I cooked the roast according to the recipe and the roast came out a perfect medium rare. I did use a digital thermometer (just to be on the safe side) and I watched as the internal temperature started to rise and after two hours the temperature was a perfect 134 degrees! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this recipe to anyone. Honestly, you won't be disappointed....perfect with Chef John's Au Jus recipe.",Amazing! I used a boneless roast but the color and flavor was perfect. Next time I might cut back on the salt. It was great and very flavorful. The video was a great primer on how to do this.,OMG I had a 2.5# bone in prime rib roast and used the 5 minute per pound thing for the first time - genius!!! The last time I cooked a small roast like this it was totally overcooked (using another recipe) so this one was definitely a welcome success!!! the only way I will cook prime from now on!!!,,,,,,,,

5,This is a delicious summer dish! It smells amazing on the bbq. I paired it with cilantro lime rice and a nice white wine on a summer night - yum! I took the chefs advice and used the jumbo shrimp. A good idea if you are making this as a main dish. Will definitely make this again.,My husband loved it. Will be making again and again.,This was fabulous! Made lime cilantro rice to go with it.,"Don't know if I did something wrong but after cooking, it tasted like the shrimp had a pasty texture to them. Flavor was good and the grilled pineapple was excellent.","I can't say that I loved it, But, It was very good",Very disappointed. Recipe was easy but tasteless. It definitely needed something to kick up the taste. Won’t make again.,I made it according to the recipe and it was delicious,"No changes, did mine on grill , have a covered deck. Smells good in winter.",great service,"Like one of the other commenters stated, the larger the size of the shrimp is better for a skewer but you can go as low as 31-40 count size. I have done it with 51-60 count but you need to put a lot more shrimp on the skewer (almost double), plus the smaller size shrinks to tiny shrimp when cooked. Great for the grill this recipe or the oven.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,this was my absolute favorite meal I have made in a long time.,Dish was so good!! I didn’t have any poblano peppers so I didn’t use them. My kids don’t like spicy foods so it was fine. I also didn’t have pork so I used hamburger. I think it would have been good either way. I ate it alone but you could put it in tacos shells or burritos and would be great. Thanks for sharing!!,Had to add additional broth to finish cooking the rice. Adding the salsa and corn caused the meal to cool off too much. Had to microwave. Overall was good.,"One of my 2020 New Years goal is to try a new recipe each week. So I started with this one! I’ll make again. I’ll try it with brown rice next time, and I’ll throw in a can of black beans too!",When do you cook the corn?,"It was very good, i love pork chops, but this is amazing",Awesome recipe and very tasty dish. Wife and Father-in-law approved meal. :),This is a very simple recipe and has good flavor even when heated up. And it is mostly cooked in one skillet. Loved it!,"The whole family enjoyed it, and it was easy to make.",I was worried about the rice cooking in the oven. The rice cooked perfectly. The recipe was full of flavor and I can’t wait to make it again. I did cut the recipe in half for 2 people and we were full.,"Super easy & delicious! Used ground beef instead of ground pork. Made this for the adults. And, made a second batch but omitted the poblanos for the kids since the poblanos gave it a pretty good amount of heat/kick.",good - had a personal problem - I didn't turn oven from broil to bake. took forever until I figured that out.,"I made it using ground chicken sausage and it was delicious!! And so easy to make. I also didn't roast the peppers, because I forgot, and just added them in to bake with the mix. It was still great!","My husband dove into this before I could take a photo. It was delicious. He said the salsa added so much brightness and added flavor. Next time I’d double the salsa. I used a SouthWest veggie combo by Birdseye ( or Green Giant ??) with cirn, black beans and peppers. It was perfect. I made the poblanos but did not use as I did not like the taste. I will try this again with chicken or ground beef. But definitely the pork again! We loved it","This recipe is so forgiving it's worth noting how easy it is to adapt. I didn't have roasted corn, so I used plain frozen corn. I also added a can of black beans, a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chilis, instead of fresh, because I had it all in the pantry. All this went in before it went into the oven. I also used jarred salsa to top it. It was delicious, and it used up stuff I had in the house. Regardless, the original recipe is very easy and very good. It's a keeper.","Took a lot longer time to make. Tasty, too much rice. Husband said,it was just ok.",We don't care for peppers so we left them out and it still worked great! It has a wonderful zesty Mexican flavor! We've even tried doubling the salsa and making soft tacos with the recipe. Same great flavor!,"Excellent for a family dinner. I couldn't get Poblano peppers so I used orange and yellow - still good. I am sure the Poblano would give it an amazing flavor! Also, i had to use ground beef instead of pork but I loved it. I hope to find both original ingredients next time I make it!",Whole family loved it! That never happens! I had some leftover chicken that was marinated in a carne asada (so I guess it’s pollo asada...? Lol). Turned out great and got to use up some leftovers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"I made this for Christmas and my family loved it. I used the baking instructions from the ""Perfect Prime Rib"" article found on this website. I chose to sear the meat then do cook the meat at the low temperature for a long time. It turned out great. Here is the information: Time and Temperature There are two ways you can roast it: At a low temperature for a long time, or At a high temperature for a shorter time. Your roast will shrink less if you cook it low and slow, but you won't get the same flavorful, well-browned exterior that a high roasting temperature gives you. It's possible to combine the two methods by starting the roast at a high temperature to sear the outside of it, then turning down the oven after 30 to 45 minutes to finish the roasting. If roasting at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), the meat will take about 17 to 20 minutes per pound. If you start the roast at 450 degrees F (235 degrees C) for the first 30 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), allow about 13 to 15 minutes per pound. The meat was tender and delicious. Thanks!","Wonderful! Even though I cooked a 4.5 lb roast, I made the amount of garlic mixture called for in the recipe, which covered the fat very generously and produced a delicious crust. One reviewer mentioned their garlic was bitter. I imagine that the high initial temperature of 500 degrees scorched the garlic. I seared my roast at 460 for 12 minutes, and then since the fat seemed like it was on the verge of smoking, I turned the oven down to 400 for the last 8 minutes. I then roasted at 350 degrees rather than the 325 in the recipe, until my meat thermometer read 130 degrees. It was juicy with beautiful pink color in the center. Thanks Chen!","who knew making prime rib could be so simple! I have to say that this is the best piece of beef I have ever prepared. The au jus was eloquent! Just the right proportion of ingredients. The combination of the thyme and garlic gives a lovely flavor to the meat. Had a 4# piece, so halved the recipe for the marinade and it was spot on. Used kosher salt and ground the paste with my mortar and pestal. Scored the fat and placed the marinade on top pressing down on the marinade to soak into the cuts. Marinated this morning and placed in fridge, took out 1 hour before making. Thanks for the recommendations of turning down oven; did at 450 for the 20minutes then proceeded. I did add some beef broth to the bits at the bottom of the pan and it made a lovely thick, rich, dark au jus. I would love to use this on other cuts of beef using the same method. thanks so much!","My first prime rib, but not my last, I can't believe how easy this was, and so good. I made this for 8 adults and it got rave reviews, my husband said it was the best he ever had. I was so nervous, I've been known to overcook many a roast, but not this one, it melted in your mouth. The only changes I made were like some of the other reviewers stated and I browned it at 460 for 12 min. and then another 8 at 400, reduced it to 325 and cooked for 20 min per pound. I took it out when the temp registered 125 (was getting nervous), and let it sit out for 20 min. It was definatly a perfect rare in the center and med-rare on the ends. Terrific! The only change for me would be maybe take it out when temp reached 130, because I like more med-rare to med. But trust me no one complained, it was high 5's all around.","Very good!! I personally think that an instant read digital thermometer is key to making a perfect prime rib. I cooked a 5 pound prime rib and used the same amount of mixture ingredients as a 10 pound roast calls for. I followed other reviews and cooked at 460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes & 325 for the remainder. I cooked it for 20-25 minutes a pound and took out of the oven when the internal temperature hit 125. I covered it in aluminum foil and let sit for about 10-20 minutes, until the internal temperature was about 135. It was a perfect medium rare.",I tried this recipe and it is awesome! I used a smaller cut of meat and adjusted the seasonings. Use an instant read thermometer and you cannot go wrong. I'm planning on using it again for our Christmas dinner. Thanks!,"Excellent flavor and easy to do. (Though I'm always a wee bit nerveous when making Prime Rib.) I followed the other Reviewers suggestions and dropped the searing temp. to 460 degrees and increased the roasting time & temp: 15 minutes & 350, respectivly. **I cut the thyme to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary. Use a meat thermometer and you really can't go wrong. Came out fabulous! I'd do this again in a minute!","Oh, my! This is absolutely fabulous, I can't believe that I made it. I used a 5.44 lb roast and followed the suggestions listed below. Thanks, Chen!!","This was the absolute best Father's Day meal I have ever fixed my husband of 15 years. After the smoke cleared out of the house (I gotta clean that oven!), it smelled like heaven in here! The crust was perfection! I was afraid the garlic and salt would make the drippings too strong to make a good gravy, but I was so, so, so wrong! After using some of the goodies from the pan to make the Yorkshire pudding, I only had about 1/3 cup left. I poured some cold canned beef broth into it, which was great because the change in temp made some of the fat coagulate so I could skim it off the top). I then thickened it with some cornstarch and served the BEST beef gravy I have ever made. Next time, I'll take the beef out at 130 so it is truly medium rare after the carryover cooking stops. I'll also get a bigger roast as my first-grader declared it his favorite meat and has been gazing longingly at the leftovers that will be tonight's dinner. Then again...maybe we'll have the beef for lunch and make Dad stop for a pizza on the way home. Hmmm! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.","Fairly standard roasting directions. Marinade nothing special. I'm curious as to what makes other reviewers believe this average ""recipe"" is 5-star caliber.","I had a 5 lb. rib roast and made half of the rub. I put the roast in at 450 for 20 minutes then reduced to 325 for the remainder. (I thought 500 degrees might burn the garlic like some other reviewers mentioned and didn't want to take the chance.) I took the meat out at 135 degrees, it rested for exactly 15 minutes, and it was a perfect light shade of pink. While the roast rested I made the following au jus: I removed the fat from the pan and added 1 cup of beef stock and a 1/2 cup of cabernet sauvignon to the drippings, and gave a light sprinkle of dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt and pepper and reduced until it thickened up a bit. Then I added 1 T of unsalted butter off the heat. The roast was tender, juicy and just perfect. Thanks, Chen!","I've done this with both a boneless and bone-in prime rib but both needed more cooking time than stated making dinner a little late but definitely worth waiting for. I made the full amount of marinade mixture for my 5.25 lb. roast. I cooked at 450 for 15 minutes to sear the outside, then lowered the temp to 325 for about 2 hrs. and 20 min. till it reached an internal temp of 140. I removed from the oven, covered it in foil and let sit for about 10 minutes. The slices on the outer edges were slightly pink and the slices towards the center were slightly more rare. Other reviewers mentioned taking the roast out at 125 or 130 which I think is too early. Cook time probably has to do with how cold the piece of meat is when it goes in the oven. I had mine on the counter for 1 hour but it was still quite chilly. I vow to get this in the oven earlier next time! I made a very simple au jus to serve with the meat by pouring off all but about 1-2 Tbsp. of fat from the roasting pan and placing over heat. I whisked in 3 cups beef broth and 1/4 cup red wine. You may need to strain through a colander to remove the blackened pieces of garlic. I also make a creamy horseradish by mixing sour cream with horseradish. We made prime rib french dip sandwiches with the leftovers. Spread the horseradish on the buns and serve with au jus. So good!","These are fairly standard seasonings for a rib roast, unfortunately though, roasting this piece of meat at such a high temperature (500 degrees) will make the garlic bitter and ruin a very expensive cut. Practice tells one to reduce the heat to 450 - 460 before putting the roast in. Pull the roast at 125 degrees and tent with foil for 10 + minutes which will allow the roast to continue to cook and the juices to absorb. It should settle at 135 degrees for a perfect medium rare!!! Good with changes....","AMAZING!!! AMAZING!! Prime rib has always been my favorite cut of meat and my grandmother would make it for me on special occasions. And although I couldn't contact my grandmother for her recipe and cooking tips, I decided to rely on this recipe and hope for the best. The results were OMG! I followed everyone's advice of 12 mins at 460 and 8 mins at 400 and then 15 mins per pound at 325 and then took it out and covered for 15 minutes. Each piece of roast was the perfect shade of pink on the inside and a bit less pink on the outsides. Even the end pieces were juicy and perfect. The roast melted in our mouths. It was a 4.5lb roast for 2 people (I wanted leftovers!) and we ate about 1lb per person cuz it was too good!! This is definitely a 5 star recipe!!! THANK YOU Chef Mike!","This was very good, but I did use different tempatures than recommended. I cross-referenced this recipe with the one in the America's Test Kitchen (ATK) cookbook. I mixed everything for the garlic topping as shown here, and it was delicious. Change nothing about it. I also then salted and peppered the rest of the prime rib. For the the temps, I did sear it in the oven at the beginning at 475 degrees, but then I turned it way down to 250 degrees. ATK recommended this to keep it juicy, and boy was it ever juicy. It will take longer to cook this way, but the slow cooking resulted in the juiciest beef. It took me about 1.5 hours to cook a 3.5 lb. roast to rare. Also the final temp of the beef I think is a little high here. ATK recommended taking it out at 125 degrees for rare, and that temp was perfect. The most important step is to take it out of the oven at the end, and tent foil over the top. Let it stand for 20-30 minutes before carving to retain all of the juices. All of your hard work will be for nothing if you don't do this most important step! Finally, I served it with a basic horseradish sauce - 1 c. sour cream, 4 tsp. prepared horseradish, 1/8 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper. Perfect for our Christmas dinner!","This prime rib was wonderful. I made it for Christmas dinner and it was the most tender prime rib I've ever had. I followed the directions exactly and couldn't have been happier with the taste. My prime rib was 8.5 pounds and unfortunately did take a little over an hour longer to cook than the stated cook time of 1:30 for medium rare. I took the roast out when the meat thermometer read 145° and that was at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I am only mentioning this for the future makers of this recipe so they can have a meat thermometer handy so they can judge when they should start to prepare their side dishes so everything will be done at once. All in all, an amazing recipe and the taste and tenderness more than made up for the late dinner :o) I highly recommend this recipe! Thank you for posting it!","This is the best roast recipe ever, look no further!!! I use a 2.5 - 3 lb. prime rib roast and half the ingredients. It has been suggested to use half thyme and half rosemary, but I always use both in equal amounts. I usually let the roast sit out for the full hour with the mixture on, I find the flavour to be more full that way. I also find the cooking time to be off (good idea to use a meat thermometer), for a 2.5 lb med-rare roast I bake at 500 for 20 mins, turn oven down to 325 and roast for an additional 50 mins, then tent the roast for 15. Enjoy!",there was a lot of smoke coming out of my oven at 500F which scared my dog like i never seen before but i stuck to it and it came out beautifully. i've used this marinade on rib-eye steaks too. works great!,"After searching the web, I stumbled across this recipe and saw soooo many good reviews of this recipe so I decided to make it. Boy am I glad I did. The taste was great, but I overcooked my prime rib roast. Lesson learned. The details are below. The only modifications I made were: -I put 6 slits on top of roast and stuffed 3 cloves of garlic (cut in half) in it. -I used kosher salt. -I used 10 cloves of garlic instead of recommended number. -I used the seasoning all over the roast. Meat: -4.5 pound prime rib roast from Costco Thermometer: -Pyrex Pro Digital Thermometer from Bed Bath and Beyond ($20) Prepared seasonings the night before and rubbed it all over roast and put in fridge overnight for a total of 16 hrs before taking out for room temperature. Left out side to come to room temperature for 2 hours. (I live in the Bay Area and my house is colder than most houses) Put in 500 degree oven for 20 minutes. (The first 10 minutes made my kitchen smell sooo good of garlic. There was no burning smell or smoke.) I then put in the thermometer (because of warning from thermometer) and put in 3 large brown potatos and 1 large sweet potato on the sides of the drip pan (not inside the drip pan). Lowered temperature to 325 degrees and cooked until internal temp hit 135 degrees. I took it out of oven and tented with foil until 145 degrees. I cut open the roast and served dinner. The meat came out perfect medium (my guests and I prefer medium rare, but it was still very","When you pay that much for a good cut of meat these days ($6.99/lb) its hard to risk trying a new recipe, but after reading all of the reviews on this one, I felt I couldn't go wrong. Boy, was I right! I had a roast of just over 4.5 lbs but as others recommended, I used the same amount of ingredients and rubbed it over the entire roast. I let the roast sit at room temp for about 45 mins. and then seared it in the oven for about 18 minutes at 425 degrees. I turned the oven down to 325 and it took another 2 hours or so to reach a temp of 140 on the meat thermometer. I took it out of the oven and let it sit, and it reached 145 on its own. Part of the roast was on the medium side while the rest was a perfect medium rare. Will definitely do this again. Update: Tried this with a 4lb New York Roast, (hubby bought it on sale saying it was half the price of a rib eye and just as good... yeah right)... The flavor was just as great (due to the marinade, of course) and the meat was very tender, but the general quality of the meat just does not compare to rib eye. Sorry honey! Don't skimp on the cut. It is well worth the price.","This was my first attempt at prime rib, and it turned out wonderfully! I had a 4 pound roast, so I lowered the initial cooking temp to 450, for fifteen minutes. I lowered the temp again to 325 for about 1 hr and ten minutes and used a foil tent. I agree with other reviewers in that the key is watching the thermometer! The roast was taken out at 130 degrees, and in fifteen minutes it was juicy, pink, and delicious. Can't go wrong with this recipe! Thanks!","First prime rib was a major success. To die for! Chose the 460 for 12, 400 for 8, 325 for 20 mins per pound. Sat 35 mins. Perfect med rare. Garlic did burn in spots but the crust was soooo delicious just the same.","Delicious! I used a 5lb prime rib. Cooked in a 460 degree oven for 12 minutes, turned down to 400 for 8 minutes after that I then turned the oven down once more to 350 and cooked it 20 minutes per pound and then an additional 15 minutes because we like OUR prime rib cooked to medium... light pink in color! It was perfect and I made an AU JUS for dipping...I added 1 cup of beef broth to the pan and and put it over heat till all the brown bitscame loose from the pan. I then strained it. PEFECT! =)","I used the recipe substituting tenderloin for prime rib due to my personal preferance, It was absolutley perfect. What a great recipe","I consider myself an expert when it comes to EATING prime rib. It's one of my favorites. So I figured it was high time for me to learn how to make this for myself. I went to the grocery store and ask the butcher for a really good cut of prime rib roast. He suggested a five pounder that was $12.00 a pound!! Now I know why it's so expensive at the resturants! So I take my little treasure home and mix up the stuff to season it with exactly per the recipe. Then I covered the entire roast with the mixture instead of just the fat part. After reading about smoking up the house at 500 degrees, I put the roast on the BBQ. I checked the temperature after two hours and it was 150 degrees. I had dinner ready for my wife when she got home complete with mixed veggies, squished taters, champagne and flowers on the table! We both thought it was one of the best tasting and juiciest prime ribs ever. The next day I made sandwiches on french bread and that too was excellent. Our BBQ has three burners and I set the front and back one to medium heat and the center one off and put the roast in the center of the BBQ and didn't open the door for two hours and it was medium with a little pink in the center. I think one and one half hours would be right for it to be rare. Absolutely, positively delecious!!!!","Everyone kept saying it was the best prime rib they ever had! And I agree! I made two 5 pound roasts and timed the cooking as a 5 lb cut. I used fresh thyme. As others suggested, I did 12 min at 460, 8 at 400, and 1 hr and 40 min at 325. Came out perfect at 125 degrees. I can't get over how good this was!","oh yeah! this was the first time i've used the ""high heat"" first method. i have to tell you that it was the best prime rib to ever grace my oven. the garlic and thyme were spot on! i did use a probe/thermometer which helped with the timing. it was pink and oh so juicy and flavourful and the gravy made with the pan juices were dynomite!!!! thanks so much Chef Mike!",I have never cooked prime rib until I tried this recipe. I cooked it for my husband's office Christmas party. Everyone loved it! I cooked a 12 lb. roast and just adjusted the cooking time. I will definitely use this recipe again. I have no fear of cooking a rib roast now!,"This is my absolute favorite recipe on this site! I can't give it enough stars. I make this for Christmas and my husband's birthday and he tells everyone how delicious it is. Of course the cut of meat is very expensive, so this meal is for special occasions in our house. I've also used a standing rib roast with great success. I altered the temp and timing a little: 450 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes, and 325 for 23 minutes per pound. EXCELLENT! Don't be intimidated by the cost of the meat - if you follow the instructions you will be rewarded! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! Did I mention that it's my favorite?! :-)",Simple and absolutely delicious! Made this recipe for the 4th time this Christmas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Great recipe! Juicy and flavorful exactly as written.,I use a little more flavorful breading 1cup of panko 1cup of seasoned bread crumbs and a cup of parmesan cheese with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh parsley a teaspoon of fresh chopped Thyme and a teaspoon of garlic powder. I brown the chicken in half butter and half olive oil. I also cook some angel hair while the chicken is browning and put it under the chicken in a casserole dish cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes remove foil add cheese and bake another 10 minutes,3 stars because this was good with my common sense modifications. I do not know how any one of you got a good result as written. #1 - 4 c. of breadcrumbs?! Whoa! Not right. I used 1 c. plus 1/2c. shredded Italian cheese blend. #2. Recipe calls for 1/2c of sauce yet in directions you are to use 1/3c. x 4 chicken breasts...? You need to 'eye this up' and put enough sauce on each piece. #3 - You cannot use 1 c. of olive oil! Did you all do this? And you had a good result? The chicken would be swimming in oil! I used a little olive oil (maybe 2 TBS?) along with a TBS of butter. #4 - Flour is not needed. #5 - Mozz cheese should be shredded not 'fresh' for best melting result. #6- Don't put fresh basil on so early. It will burn - leave it for the last 5 min or use dried. Now with these changes the dish was delicious - but I guess it is now my own version of chicken parmesan.,This recipe was really easy to follow & turned out great! My 1st try at chicken parmesan total success:-),Have to admit if it's not easy and/or tasty I won't put the effort in. The WHOLE famiily loved this and every recipe gets easier each time its' made right? I only used 1/2 the Panko. I didn't use the crumbs sparingly either. I only put 2 c in and had the other 2 c in a bowl in case they were needed. I cut the chicken breasts in half before using the meat mallet. The fillet seemed too big without doing this and it was easier for someone to have a second helping. I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I Loved the sifter for the flour; that worked great! Given that I had twice as many fillets next time I would probably use half the oil so I could have clean oil and maybe do the chicken in 2 batches. (I also used paper towels for excell oil.) As much as I loved this recipe given the calories/fat I would not make it as often as I'd like. 10/2012- Just made this again for Sunday dinner the family LOVES this recipe! I skipped/forgot the provolone this time around and used shredded mozzerella. Even though it's not as crispy I made sure to have enough for leftovers. Also- use paper towels to collect extra oil after frying. TIP- If you buy chicken in bulk then cut trim and pound with mallet before freezing for later use this saves lots of time during actual recipe.,Some time ago I learned a useful trick: instead of steps 3-6 above after the chicken breasts have been pounded and seasoned as in step 2 lightly brush both sides with heavy 33-35%MF whipping cream (use a pastry brush). Then transfer breasts to breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture as made in step 4 pressing the crumbs into both sides. I now use this method for virtually all recipes which call for breading including fish pork veal etc. It is easier and less messy than using flour eggs and milk to bind the breading to the meat and I have found that it works equally well.,All I can say is Wow! I have made chicken parmesan using the most popular recipe from this site but this recipe blew the other out of the park! This is a no brainer. My goal in writing this review is to let Members know that just because a recipe has a thousand hits/reviews does not always mean its the best. I followed this recipe for the most part however made a few changes. I substituted regular bread crumbs and a jar of Classico traditional sweet basil. This turned out amazing! I used the entire jar of sauce because I served it over penne pasta. I put a thin spread of sauce on the bottom of the pan prior to placing the chicken inside. This recipe will definitely be a keeper and I won't hesitate to forward this recipe on to others. What a treat!,Incredible dish! Great for dinner guests. For those folks cooking in high altitude 15 or 20 minutes is not quite enough to cook the chicken breasts. You might want to cook them a little longer (6-7 minutes) on top of the stove or microwave them for several minutes (3 minutes)before serving. Cut them in half to check doneness before serving. If you put them back in the oven for too long the cheese might burn.,I made this exactly as directed and it was GREAT! So easy and fast - fabulous use of bnls/sknls chicken breast. It came out moist & tender with the crunchy top - perfect. Served it on angel hair pasta with buttered italian bread and it was a hit. Thank you John - your wife is lucky to have you! I love your videos & sense of humor and your food is excellent! (swoon...get me the fainting couch!),"This Chicken Parmesan was so good that I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day. I'm writing this review and giving my rating provided that I followed the directions of the recipe exactly as stated. I don't like reviews where people make a bunch of changes then rate ""their"" version. No thanks. This recipe is absolutely fantastic. There is not much more I can say. I have four kids ages 2-8 and they all loved it. I would stress the importance of pounding the chicken between the two plastic bags. It sounded strange to me but it makes a difference. Give yourself lots of time to make this meal. Its time consuming but worth it. I served it over angel hair with sides of steamed broccoli and garlic bread. Yum!",Absolutely perfect! I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and my very picky fiancee loved it! The crispy chicken was great!,Wow! The best part is that it doesn't have any ingredients only found in one store in a hidden back ally in an unknown town 40 miles outside of Paris.,This was great. My teenage grandson keeps asking me to make it again and again and he is so fussy about food I can't believe it. My other grandson made it first and served my daughter and I and then told me where to find the recipe. I have made it three times already. The only change I made to the recipe was adding garlic powder and seasonall to the chicken before flouring it and adding garlic powder to the panko. Deliciious!!!,This is very easy to make! It is very delicious and turns out just as it should,I made this tonight gluten free and it turned out amazing. Even my husband that is not a fan of gluten free food thought this was delicious. To make panko crumbs I used rice chex cereal and crushed to the consistency of bread crumbs. I also used gluten free flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Thanks for a wonderful easy recipe that I will make many times in the future.,I made this for dinner tonight for a bunch of teenagers. They LOVED it! i didn't have enough panko so I topped the panko off with bread crumbs. I had to use an extra egg. I added about 1 T garlic power and 1 T onion powder the bread crumbs. The chicken was juicy and tender. The breading was very tasty. And most importantly like I said...the picky teenagers LOVED it! It's definitely a keeper!,Nice recipe! Was very much enjoyed at my house. I took some advice from other reviewers though and spiced up the breading process a bit. Simply add a half teaspoon of salt paprika and pepper to the flour mix and a dash or two of worchestershire to the beaten eggs. Easy peasy!,I made this exactly like the recipe called for except that I used a spaghetti sauce. The chicken had no flavor at all and lost what seemed like a nice crust after being soaked is sauce. If I would make this again I would cook the chicken in the pan instead of transferring the chicken over into the oven. Then heat sauce separately and top at the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"I made Chef John's meatloaf a week or so ago and it was quite tasty which made me excited to try his meatball recipe. The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I'd double the italian seasoning but that's really just personal to our family.","These meatballs were awesome! I added more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, left out the red pepper, and used beef broth instead of milk. They were a big hit and I even posted a picture! Thanks Chef John!","CJ's Italian Meatballs Haiku: ""I can't believe it. These beat 'Meatball Nirvana' And they held up too!"" So my biggest praise for these meatballs is that after I made a double-batch, w/o changing the recipe, I froze them into weekly portions, but after thawing a handful of them in sauce last night, I couldn't have been more delighted that they held their meatball shape and didn't fall apart! So I don't know what of CJ's method, or ingredients, resulted in a firm (oh yes, and scrumptious!) meatball, but I think this recipe has replaced AR's 'Meatball Nirvana' in our house from now on.","Excellent meatballs! They are perfectly seasoned! I prefer to mix the bread crumbs with milk in a large bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes then mix in the eggs, parsley, parmesan cheese, the sautéed onions with garlic and all of the dry seasonings into this bowl. In a separate large bowl, I mix the beef and pork together then mix the contents of the previous bowl into the bowl of meat and place it into the fridge for an hour or so before forming the meatballs. I think that by doing so – everything mixes together more evenly. I find it impossible to mix the beef and pork together without using your hands, same goes for mixing the meat with the remaining ingredients. I didn’t notice any toughness in the meatballs by doing it my way. I’ve heard numerous times to not work ground beef too much otherwise the meat will turn tough. I don’t believe that myth. I use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and pack them into balls with wet hands. I added half of the cooked meatballs to a simmering pot of marina sauce and finished simmering them in the sauce for an hour. The remaining meatballs were put in a freezer bag and frozen for later use.","These are FANTASTIC meatballs! I used meatloaf mix, b/c it was cheaper (believe it or not) than buying the beef and pork seperately. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain and dried parsley in place of the fresh. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise and would not change a thing next time. I was scared b/c the mixture was so soft (even after refrigeration), but I proceeded on, and I am so glad I didn't add extra breadcrumbs like I wanted to...these held their shape and were so moist, tender, flavorful and delicious...one of the best I've made/eaten! I used my large cookie scoop and got 26 out of this recipe. My family RAVED over these...even my 10 month old twins couldn't get enough, lol. Seriously, these are sooooo good! I will def be using this recipe over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)","These meatballs were excellent! I followed the recipe as is. No problems with it whatsoever. Thanks Chef John! Fellow members, please refrain from changing the recipe to suit yourself and rate it as if its the exact recipe that is posted. If you make changes, any changes to the recipe, you're rating your own recipe..Doesn't make sense.",I just took these out of the oven and they were swimming in liquid!! They weren't browned or even close - the flavor of the meat is good but the consistency of the cooked meatballs is wrong - won't make again!,"These tasted really good and were super easy to make. Just a couple of things: I think next time I'll use maybe a 1/3 cup of milk as they were almost too juicy to form into balls. Also, next time I will try baking them with a rack in the pan as they really did make a lot of grease and I think they would taste better without sitting in it. Third, I wish they would have browned up a little better. I even kept them in the oven for a few more mintutes at 450 and that didn't help. But, again, the best tasting meatballs I've ever made. Nothing wrong with the recipe as written, just personal preference, a five star recipe for sure!","Wow. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe to a T and I wasn't disappointed. These meatballs were intended for sub sandwiches with marinara, but after tasting them fresh out of the oven, I felt like I was doing an injustice to this fine specimen of meat by slopping marinara over it. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be using this for years.",Amazing!! Made these to add to my spaghetti sauce and they were delicious exactly as written! We froze half of them and I can't wait to use them for meatball subs!,"I made these mostly as written though I halved the recipe for my small family. They were the tastiest meatball I've ever tried! I chose to use all ground beef instead of with pork, and used 93% lean for a healthier choice. I loved that this didn't require the pan browning first. We ate these plain without a sauce with herb roasted potatoes and a salad, and it was such a tasty meal. The meatballs were very moist with a perfect texture. I'll make these from now on, and will also add these to my spaghetti sauce!","Ok I have already reviewed the Recipe, but I had to add this one too. I came home from work and we were having Spaghetti with Meat Sauce. After a couple of bites, I said this was a terrific sauce and asked where my bride had gotten the recipe. She smiled a little then told me how she was a little distracted when making the meatballs and how she just added the meat to the sauce pan with the onions, and when she realized what she had done it was too late. Very Funny, so I think we stumbled on another Recipe ""Chef John's Meat Sauce"".",This was my first time ever making meatballs. I thought they were a bit of a pain and did not add anything to a recipe. But my husband specifically asked for meatballs with his spaghetti so I decided to try this one since it did not call for them to be cooked twice like every other meatball recipe I have ever read. I could not be happier than if I had not had to make them at all! This recipe was super easy and super tasty! These were as easy as making meat loaf and tasted better! I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us and put the full recipe amount of the herbs as my husband likes things spicy. Even the red pepper flakes. They were not too hot even for me and I cannot tolerate a lot of hot. I would cut them in half for children though. I was worried about the salt because I don't care for a lot of salt but I left it alone this first time except for cutting it in half thinking if it was too salty I would cut it next time. It was just right. We both loved this recipe. If you try only one meatball recipe make it this one you will not be sorry! Thank you Chef John for sharing this super good and super easy meatball recipe!,"These meatballs were awesome! Like most other people, I did change a few things, but only because I didn't have the exact ingredients listed. I had 93/7% ground beef so I used 1 1/2 lbs of that and I was going to use 1/2 lb Jenni-O Sweet Italian Sausage with casings removed. But by accident I had bought Turkey Bratwurst. So I used 2 of them and mashed them thoroughly into the ground beef. I also used about 1tablespoon of dried parsley instead of fresh, only 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. And when the onion was about finished cooking, I added the chopped garlic to bring out the flavor. For me, it made 28 meatballs and each was 2 Weight Watcher points plus. Since it's just my husband and myself, we have 2 more meals now in the freezer already in the sauce that I made and 16 more meatballs (without sauce) bagged in the freezer as well. Now we can have these delicious meatballs any time we want.",Best meatballs ever! These were delicious and hit the spot for the hubs who was craving spaghetti & meatballs. Instead of using plain ground pork I used groung italian sausage (mild). After baking them I let them simmer in marinara with sliced italian sausage to meld the flavors. We had leftover meatballs so made meatball subs for lunch the next day. Even better the second day. Will definitely make this recipe again!,"Huge hit w/the boys here! Easy & quick to make. I didn't precook the onions, just chopped them fine in my mini chopper & threw them in. Decreased the salt & pepper by 1/2 as a personal preference.","This recipe is perfect!! The meatballs held together very well, perfectly spiced!! I scooped with a cookie scoop to make sure all meatballs were even sized.","Fantastic recipe - made GREAT meatballs sandwiches! I love the red pepper flakes, they gives the meatballs a little added punch!","My husband hates italian food, but he will eat it occasionally for me and the kids. He LOVED these meatballs!! He actually went back for 2nds and 3rds!! Thank you Chef John!!!","Delicious meatballs. I have always baked my meatballs. It gives them a great flavor and makes it easier to cook and to cleanup. The only change I made was to use only ground beef instead of beef and pork mixture, its just a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe Chef John.","O so delish. Loved them. I did add more Italian seasoning, about TBL. Also added more garlic, about 4 gloves. Served them on steak Italian rolls. Put provolone cheese on rolls then put under broiler until melted. Um Um good. Thanks Chef John for the recipe.","I've made big batch meatballs this way for the freezer for years, and I use all the ingredients here except for the olive oil and salt. I never make less than 5 lb meat at a time, and this makes about 6 quart size freezer bags of 30 meatballs each. I don't really measure seasonings anymore, I just eyeball them. I do have a rule of 1 egg to 1 lb meat, and no more than 1 C of filler to 5 lb meat. The rest I wing to taste, as many of the 600+ reviewers also do. I mix the fillers, seasonings, liquids, and eggs in a big mixing bowl, then add the meat and mix thoroughly. I don't precook anything, and it all comes out of the oven very tender. I use cookie scoops, small for spaghetti and large for subs, to scoop out a half sheet pan of balls, then go back and roll them. I bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, pull out the tray, drain grease, then use a spatula to loosen the balls and shake them around at bit. Back in the oven until well browned (sometimes need to broil a bit), and drain again before cooling and packing in freezer bags. My husband likes meatballs, and this is the most painless way for me to satisfy his craving. I think this recipe is more about process and less about amounts as everyone's taste is a bit different.","I tried these meatballs for the first time today. I made them exactly according to the recipe like I always do when I try something for the first time. Whenever I am looking for a particular recipe I always try Chef John's first so this was a little disappointing. I'd like to make a few comments that others can use or take with a grain of salt (excuse the pun): 1.The red pepper didn't make the meatballs spicy or hot so I wouldn't hesitate to use it again. 2.The meatballs were not ""Italian"" enough for me so I, like others, would increase the Italian spices or use fresh & 4 cloves of garlic would have been better than three. 3.The onions only took about 10 minutes to become transparent. You don't want them to brown and taste like ""fried"" onions so watch carefully. 4. The recipe had too much onion and made them taste like meatloaf. I would cut back or eliminate next time. 5. I felt 40 smaller meatballs would be better in the sauce. I made thirty but they seemed big. 6. Mine browned only slightly but I didn't keep them in longer as I didn't want them to dry out. May try 450 degrees & decrease the time if I decrease size. 7. I used at least 1/2 cup of parsley, pressed down, and it was fine. Question: Any tips on how to keep them from going flat on the bottom? All in all a pretty good recipe I will try again. Video shows good instructions for forming and mixing. Thanks Chef John.","This is honestly the best meatball recipe around! If you use the suggested ingredients and assemble the meatballs as Chef John suggests you will have tasty, juicy, flavorful meatballs every time! They also freeze well and are just as good reheated.","I made this recipe for appetizers, so I made the balls about 1"". I baked the meatballs on a cookie cooling rack on the baking sheet so the grease drains off, plus the heat circulates around the meatballs (350 for 12 minutes). They are perfect! Very tasty! I plan to reheat the meatballs in marinara sauce on New Years.","He knew the battle had been won, but at what cost? The destruction made the thought of a Pyrrhic victory pleasurable. An impossible luxury. The dust settled, the expectant groans and echoing screams of such a fight rang in his head but the grounds offered only silence. There were no survivors. Evil incarnate. The scorched Earth salted by the blood of the aggressors sucked the spectrum of light into its depths, reflecting back the closest resemblance of Hell even Mother Earth could not comprehend of the once bountiful pasture. Lucifer himself winced at the sight, and far be it from any being to assume him a coward. You would do the same. Who is to blame, he thought. Blame? An irrelevant childish concept. Had simply one more meatball been crafted, baked, seared to absolute undeniable juicy perfection, perhaps I wouldn't be telling this story. The story of the time I served John's meatballs at my neighborhood potluck. Chef John's Italian meatballs.","Quite good. This recipe makes a lot. If you're not feeding a crowd, I recommend using the leftover meat in ""Chef John's Stuffed Peppers"", which are super good",This recipe is super and easy. It is the homemade taste I have been looking for. I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. I used 2 lbs. beef and 1 lb. Italian sausage. instead of fresh parsley and garlic I substituted with 3 teaspoons garlic salt with parsley in it and held the salt as well. The rest of the ingredients were increased by 50% to accommodate the extra beef. I got 60 meatballs out of my batch!,Followed this to the letter; makes fabulous meatballs! Family loved them! Thanks!,"These meatballs were the BOMB! I have never made meatballs before that were very good. I have tried with similar ingredients but never had a good result. These would also be great in meatball sandwiches, because they were so flavorful. FWIW, I did not chill the meatballs because my ingredients were already cold and I was hungry! I made them about 2"" in size. And I did use fresh parsley. Love this recipe!",These were some of the better meatballs I've had.,My boyfriend made these meatballs. He stunk of garlic for 2 days. My dog loved it because it was coming out his pores!,I have made this recipe three times and got great reviews each time. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I used bulk hot Italian sausage for the ground pork.,"My Sicilian husband said these were the best meatballs he ever tasted - even better than his mother's - and in 10 years of marriage, I've never heard him say that about anything! I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but did add a pound of mild Italian sausage and a package of chopped Prosciutto (and increased the rest of the ingredients 1 1/2 times to make up for the increase in protein). Sorry John, but I think that made a big difference in the flavor! I would strongly recommend at least adding the sausage - it makes a big impact!","I've made these twice now, and I don't think I'll ever bother to look for another recipe. For years -- well, decades -- I've gotten frustrated trying to fry meatballs without them falling apart, and they always turn out a bit tough if you get them dry enough to hold together. With these, the mixture is a bit wet, but it doesn't matter at all because they're baked, like miniature meat loaves, which is what good meatballs should be anyway. They're easy to make, turn out terrific -- tender and flavorful -- and cleanup is a snap as long as you use wide, heavy-duty foil so it completely covers the pan and doesn't tear. These will be a new standard in our house.",i have tried this recipes but would reduce the pepper in half. and do the same for the salt,I had to add more bread crumbs ( the good Italian ones that we all use.) I did not have parm cheese on hand ( oops.) I did his cooking method. I wanted to just throw them in the sauce uncooked. I only made 20 balls . wife loves big balls.......so I saved half the balls for another noodle journey. excellent balls!,"Best meatballs I've ever had. I made without he onion, and parsley after trying them with and liked them better without. Make them every time I make spaghetti now. The entire family loves them.","This was delicious! I will definitely be making these again. I halved the recipe, using 1 lb ground beef (I didn't have any pork on hand) and got 18 meatballs. I added the garlic to the onions about halfway through the cooking time, and used Italian breadcrumbs. Thank you, CJ!","BEST MEATBALLS EVER!!! My 6-yr-old hates meatballs, but I made her try one of these anyway. She went back & attempted to load her plate down with as many as she could get! I did make one major change to this recipe: Spinach. Instead of the ground pork, I used a 10-oz pkg of chopped spinach (squeeze all the water out after thawing). I had to stop myself from eating these before dinnertime! YUMMY!!!!!",These are EXCELLENT as is! I think that next time I will try doubling the spices to add more flavor. The taste and the texture were so good that we want more of that taste!,"I MADE THE 1/3 BEEF , 1/3 SAUSAGE ,1/3 VEAL !!! They came out fantastic !! I used my mother~in~laws family sauce recipe . It was a great compliment to sauce . I will use this ""meat ball' recipe from now on thank you for making it so easy for me !!!!",,
10,"Great flavor and wonderful seasonings but I made a lot of revisions. First I used 2 pounds stew meat rather than 1/2, and I didn't boil the beef, I dredged it in seasoned and browned it, then set it aside. I omitted parsnips (what are parsnips anyway?) and zucchini. Rather than go through the whole roasting pan ordeal, I dumped the browned beef & 1 can of beef broth into the pot with veggies, added a cup of water put the lid on & simmered for about 1 1/2 hours. The only change I will make next time would be to add the apples about half way through, because they were a bit soggy after cooking. Other than that, it's DELICIOUS! Wasn't too spicy for my kids either.",A good spicy meal. My hubby made it while I was out and I came home to the house smelling yummy! The spice was a little much for me but perfect for my hubby.,"This was heavenly! And wow, did it smell good cooking. I think you could use just about any combination of vegetables and it would work. We served it with saffron rice and naan, and it was delicious. Thank you so much for posting this!","This was a delicious curry and excellent way to use up left over root vegetables. I added a can of coconut milk to the recipe. It had a bit more spice than I like, but my husband found it just right. It was perfect for a cold winter night meal.","This is a great recipe!! We only used half of the recipe, the other half went in the freezer. So to half of this recipe, I added 1 can coconut milk, (just because we love it, and it makes a nice sauce) tablespoon of mango chutney, more curry powder, and used left over roast beef, which I added near the end of the baking time, with the apples. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!","Fantastic! A flavorful escape from our norm and even the kids enjoyed it. I forgot to buy the beef so we did just the vegetables and used beef broth as the liquid (also threw in a rutabaga). The house smelled so good while it was cooking. We used extra garlic but still found that the ginger was the strongest flavor. Looking for the 5 spice, I found Dukkah blend at Trader Joe's: almonds, sesame seeds, fennel seeds, coriander, anise seeds, and kosher salt. Used about a tablespoon of that with the curry and turmeric but forgot to add cinnamon and cloves. Overall, it was better than I thought it would be.","The spices are nice, but made it a stoup instead of baking, made few adjustments since I don't like the bland result. So I added 2 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoons Thai yellow curry paste, 150ml coconut milk (not too thick). I add in apple at the end. If you mix a bit of couscous or oatmeal, garnish with coriander leaves, it becomes a full meal and tastes wonderful, very light beef curry stoup, the coconut milk does wonders.",Just ok. Served this over rice,"In progress, ingredients are very appealing. Although much a pealing to do... looks great so far. I couldn't find locally sourced parsnips, so substituted a turnip. We'll see if turning up the volume does anything bad. check my other substitutions in the pic","Delicious! Floured and browned the beef first, then put in crockpot for 4 hrs., added 3/4 can of coconut milk as someone suggested, also doubled curry, last 1/2 hr. added cashews and raisins.",This is a very tasty and comforting food. I made it how the receipt calls for. Next time I will not boil the meat but sear it in the pan that the veggies get cooked in. Then cook it for less time in the oven. Also I might try to add coconut milk in it to sweeten it and add another depth of flavor.,"This was okay. The recipe was followed, with the omittance of cashews, as none were on hand. The beef needed another 30 minutes of slow cooking. We both felt it needed a bit more flavor, be it curry, garlic or seasonings.",Interesting. I made it with boca burger instead of beef and eggplant as I did not have zucchini. And more of potatoes instead of pasnips.,"Delicious! I added some vegetable stock and rosemary to the chicken (I had no beef) while cooking and substituted 1 extra carrot and 1 extra potato because I had no parsnips. I left out the raisins and used peanuts too. It turned out great, but I'm sure it would have even without the adjustments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Very tasty! I only used 2 Tbsp. of oil, and I think next time I will half the salt. I cooked it on medium for 6 minutes per side to avoid having the sauce stick to the pan. Very easy to make and great flavor!","What an amazing recipe! I made it exactly as written, except that I grilled it outdoors instead of cooking in a pan. The flavor was outstanding. The cardamom really takes this to another level, so don't leave it out! It's a pricey spice, but well worth it! I will be making this frequently, especially for guests because it will definitely impress. Next time I will try it with the orange zest, as suggested. Thank you for the great recipe!",I loved the flavor combination. Will keep in the rotation for weeknight meals. I like to buy a large tray of salmon at Costco and then freeze it in smaller portions - this is a great way to use the frozen/thawed leftovers.,"delightful! we eat a lot of Indian cuisine, so I had all the spices on hand. I added a little cayenne since we like heat. baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. To my taste the flavors were very subtle and didn't overpower the flavor of the fish, but rather complemented it nicely.","Wow! Fabulous flavor and so easy to prepare! I usually poach our salmon, so just made a half recipe of the sauce and poured it on top of 3 salmon filets from Costco. I only used an 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper, as some of the family have sensitive stomachs. I added perhaps one or two tablespoons of water, so there would be enough moisture to create steam to poach the fish when the lid was placed on the pan. I'll be making this again and again! UPDATE: I made this for a second time, poaching as before. This time, I sprinkled the dry spices over the salmon, and drizzled a bit of maple on each filet. I skipped the oil entirely and everyone liked it even better than last time. It's my new ""impress the company"" recipe!","My husband fishes in Alaska every year, I always have a freezer full of fresh Salmon and I am always looking for new recipes this one is a keeper, it is simple and simply delicious. Don't hesitate give it a try.","Ahhhhhmazing. But the Cordamom can be overpowering so my recommendation is to use a little less than the recipe calls for. Even so, I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. I cooked it for a friend and she couldn't get enough of it! She said to me: ""This is restaurant quality food."" Will definitely make again and again.","I’m always looking for new ways to fix salmon. This was a nice change from what seems like the same old boring seasonings. The spice combination complimented the salmon very well. My only problem was keeping the salmon from burning. Thank goodness hubby is a sport when it comes to eating charred food. I reduced the heat to a lower setting, but the longer cook time still resulted in a slightly burnt coating. I think this would be fantastic cooked on a grill.",Tasted great. Easy to make. Family loved it.,I used the sauce on a whole salmon I made on the BBQ. It was really good. Everyone in the family loved it though a couple people commented it was a touch too salty. I'll cut the salt back to 1 tsp next time.,"I really liked this a lot. My husband and kids were not as thrilled as me, but they don't enjoy salmon as much as I do, either. The flavor was great and it was easy to cook. I served this with soba noodles but I think rice would work better. I might reduce the oil a bit next time as well.","I made this yesterday with some spinach. It was excellent. Next time I make this salmon, I will not put so much salt. I think 1 teaspoon would have been enough.",Yummy!,"I made this specifically because of the cardamom. I was looking for more recipes containing cardamom. This sounded wonderful with the maple syrup. I rubbed the salmon with the oil and then rubbed the spices in. Then added the maple syrup. I did this about an hour before cooking Delicious and will certainly make it again, especially for guests. Quick and easy.",It was ok but nothing special to my taste,"This is a unique blend of smoky and sweet. Super easy! Will definitely make this again. Hint - do use the orange zest, really kicks the taste up.",I cut back on cardamom and it was still too much.,"Made this nearly as written, only I used regular canola oil as I didn't have the grapeseed and used half as much salt. Plus I added a bit of orange zest, which was a good choice. Turned out the orange zest was all I could taste! It was all pleasant enough, though mostly boring, but I really wanted to taste the cardamom. Maybe with some tweaking this could be better but I'm not sure if anything will make me remember it long enough to try it next time.",Tasty! I followed the recipe and enjoyed it.,"Very east to make and quite yummy! The taste is not too sweet, just right.",Really wasn't a fan of the cardamom :/,Holy moly! Super delish!!!!,This is the most delicious salmons I've ever eaten. My husband isn't a seafood person and he said he would totally eat this again. We had it with steamed snap peas and rice. Yum!,Very good exactly as written.,Very easy to follow recipe and a wonderful flavor taste,"Love salmon and this was awesome, will definitely make it again!","this recipe is great. I do it often, never disappointed",I cut way back on the salt and baked it in the oven at 350 till flakey. A nice change of flavors for salmon.,"I agree with another reviewer who said it was hard to keep from burning because of the maple syrup. If you lower the temperature, you'll have to increase the cook time which doesn't help much. I added just a small drizzle of oil to the pan. I also don't think the flavor was very strong. Seemed like a good combination of spices but I could hardly taste them. I would recommend marinating this before cooking.","Haven't wanted to try another salmon recipe since finding this one, just perfect. I cook mine on a cedar plank on the BBQ each time, delicious!","Thumbs up. Roasted it at 375 for 15 min. Served with asparagus and risotto. Husband said it was ""kinda amazing""and we eat salmon a lot.",Delish!,"So good!! Will probably be making once a week for a while!! I cut the recipe down for 2 servings and asked my boyfriend to pick up two 1/3 pound salmon fillets. Instead, he came back with two 10 ounce fillets. Poured half of the glaze over each fillet and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes. Served over a bed of mixed field greens with a side of roasted sweet potatoes in an indian spice blend. We couldn't stop talking about it all night. The only note I have is that I entered the recipe into my ""My Fitness Pal"" app and the calories came in way under the calorie count listed on this page... even with the larger salmon fillets. Not complaining about that :)","I liked it, but I think I didn't allow the fish to thaw completely because the glaze was watery. It had a decent flavor and It was a nice change from the ordinary. I think the next time I prepare it I will take the time to be certain the fish is completely thawed and towel dried before I glaze them.",,,,,,,,,,
12,My husband and I loved this entree and would highly recommend it! I substituted Bone-In Pork Shoulder Spare Rib meat and Yukon Gold Potatoes (what I had on hand) and found it to be delicious! The funny thing is...I'm not even a big pork fan by nature. L&M from MN,Very satisfying and easy to make.,"OMG, this was soooo good. Leftovers were good too. I made some changes only because I bought a 3.8 pound top pork loin on sale for $8 instead of the 1.9 pound pork tenderloin for $16. So I had to go to my good old Betty Crocker cookbook and to the internet to get cooking times. Did all of the ingredients the same, except left off garlic and doubled all the ingredients and increased apple cider to 2 cups. I did the rub ahead of time because I was home anyway and let it sit under a blanket of plastic rap for 4 hours before cooking. Betty Crocker said to cook Top Pork Loin at 325 for 30-40 mins per pound to get internal temp of 170. I cooked it for a total of about 2 hours at 350 with just the cider mix (no sweets or apples). Also had to look up Sweet Potatos = 350 degrees for about an hour. So added them after Pork loin cooked for one hour. And I looked up Apples = 350 for about 15 minutes (I did smaller slices - like 8/apple). Even though I did over cook it a smidge, when I made the first cut, liquid squirted out and I knew it would be juicy and tender, which it was. For leftovers, we put potoatoes/apples/juice in sauce pan on low. And my husband dabbed some of the juice on the pork slices and put brown sugar/ginger mix on each side. He cooked them separately in the oven on stoneware plate at 350 for about 7 minutes then broiled at 500 until a little bubbly - a couple minutes.","I liked the seasonings very much, but, while the sweet potatoes cooked to perfection, the apples were mushy. I would recommend making sure you use a firm apple like Granny Smith or Pippin.",Strong cumin taste. I will probably omit the garam masala next time. Apples & sweet potatoes were perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,Added evaporated milk to make it creamer.,"Wow, super comfort food quality! I would like to say that I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have any liquid smoke so I had to leave that out. It was very thick so I added a teaspoon of Better than Bouillon beef concentrate with a cup of water and this was made it the perfect consistency to spoon over the egg noodles.",Very easy and delicious recipe. The sauce is very thick. If you like a thinner stroganoff I think this would be good by including a little beef broth when adding the ingredients at the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"I added sliced portobello mushrooms because I love them and used Victoria White Linen Marinara. I couldn’t find the chili paste so I used red pepper flakes and chili powder. This recipe is really easy, has a lot of flavor and makes a lot of leftovers.","Really good! I made it exactly as instructed (er.... except I did 5 cloves of garlic... hehehe) since I’ve never made anything like this before and I’m a novice cook. I’m not on keto but just a wanted something tasty and healthy. I usually don’t like cauliflower but the cauliflower rice was well incorporated and didn’t bother me at all. The only thing is that I would like to find a way to make the sauce of the mixture a little bit thicker next time (maybe slightly less water or a little bit of some kind of thickener? Or let it simmer a bit longer?). Sorry my picture isn’t great, the red plates we have don’t make food the most photogenic. Anyway it was delicious and I’d definitely make it again even if I can’t thicken it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Very good, simple straightforward and delicious.","I'll admit that I did make a couple changes: I used pickle juice instead of buttermilk (didn't have it) to marinate the chicken, I didn't add any hot sauce, and I forgot to add the ranch mix to the marinade so I split it between the wet and dry coating. I was most impressed by the crunchiness of the batter! I have a go-to Chic-Fil-A copycat recipe that possibly has a slightly better flavor, due to the addition of a TB of powdered sugar in the dry batter, but it does not achieve the crust that you'll get with this recipe. I really liked the flavor! I definitely recommend marinating your chicken overnight or as long as you can before cooking.","Made this the way Chef suggested (mostly), and split the recipe two ways to make a mild version for me, and a spicy version for my husband. The breading was great, but I think next time I will use slightly less cornstarch, because I think that might be why the breading comes off the chicken when you bite into it. I didn't really care though, the overall seasoning is awesome.","This had a breading that was similar to a cross between a Mc chicken sandwich and a Chick-fil-A sandwich. I highly recommend you only use one chicken breast to make two sandwiches. If you prefer the bun a Chick-fil-A sandwich comes on, you really need to use brioche buns and be sure to toast it before assembling your sandwich. Do not be afraid to add the cayenne pepper to your breading. it doesn’t really add any heat, just flavor. I also added hot sauce to mayo. At 40 years old, this is the first fried chicken I have ever successfully made. It is super easy if you follow the recipe. Good luck and Enjoy!!","So first off I used a breast that was WAY to thick which made for some very raw chicken in the center, this meant I had to throw it into the oil for a second round. Beyond my own personal failings I actually found the breading itself to be rather basic, not terrible, not great. I generally don’t enjoy frying things since hot oil scares me so needless to say, given all that this won’t be one of the Chef’s recipes I go back to. (Luckily there are plenty of others I love to cook over and over!)",I followed this recipe and it does not have the taste of either Popeye's or Chick fil a,"wow. we've made this as ordered, but we also used the buttermilk marinade for chicken wings and are REALLY pleased with the results. We haven't been back to that... place since we started making this recipe. If you do it right, it comes out great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it tasted great but was too dry. So I doubled the sauce used a deep dish pie plate reduced the temp to 375 & baked for 45 minutes. It was perfectly moist without being runny and the pie shells were perfectly done. Absolutely fabulous! Goes without saying it is a keeper!,After reviewing several ratings I made some recommended changes. The first being I added more seasoning (garlic pepper garlic powder poultry seasoning) to the sauce and to the chicken mixture before cooking. Also I cooked the chicken and veggies in chicken stock instead of water. My husband doesn't like celery so I used potato instead and also added some corn. I used Pillsbury ready made pie crusts (so easy..just open and unroll). And after brushing with egg white baked the bottom crust for 5 minutes. I doubled the sauce and added most to the chicken mixture before putting it into the pan. I baked on 375 for 40 minutes. It looked and tasted delicious!!,I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for the way it turned out after my modifications without them I doubt it would have been as good. I took a lot of the previous suggestions and I boiled my veggies in chicken broth (just added a boullion cube) although I didn't use peas (can't stand them) and just boneless skinless breast meat. I used 3/4 cup of onion and subbed 1/2 tsp garlic powder for celery seed (didn't have any). I drained the broth from the veggies and used 2 cups in the pan and after I added everything into the crust I poured about another 1/4 cup of broth in with everything (as other reviewers complained it was too dry). Cooked for 30 min in a gas oven and it came out perfect! Will definitely make again. edited to add: I also made this with 3 small cubed potatoes and it made it even better.,Boil the chicken and veggies? For 15 minutes? And then throw the broth away? Then add canned broth? Really? Is that how to do it? I suggest sauteeing the chicken pieces celery and onion together adding the frozen veggies add the broth spices and mix the flour with a little water to add and thicken the mixture.,"This was SO delicious the best I have ever tasted. I made it with the ""Butter Flaky Pie Crust"" and it turned out perfectly flaky and wonderful. I pre-baked the bottom crust for 6 minutes doubled the black pepper added a tsp. of poultry seasoning and garlic salt and a diced potato. I added an extra 1/4 c each of milk and broth to combat any dryness. It turned out SPECTACULAR and was a huge hit with the family...they even ate it for breakfast. Will definitely make this again.","I am not a ""pot pie"" fan but made this for my guy yesterday. Took the advice of others and used a rotisserie chicken added poultry seasoning and garlic powder etc. Also used frozen deep dish pie shells. Next time I will mix the filling and gravy together before putting it in the shell. I couldn't get the liquid to seep down through which caused the filling to be a bit too dry. I also think it needed a little bit more salt so will use garlic salt rather than powder next time. It was still pretty good considering my distaste for ""pot pies"". Definitely think mixing the filling with the liquid is the answer. Update: made this again but used frozen mixed veggies in addition to a cubed potato and the onion. Made extra gravy (about 1/2 more) and mixed with the filling before putting in the pie shell. Really helped the dryness. Yet another update: Made this again using phyllo puff pastry in ramekins and wow is it good! Perfect size for the grand kids who loved it! We also froze some and took to work for lunch - takes about 5-7 minutes in the microwave! Note: I always have L.B. Jamison's chicken soup base on hand and add a spoonful to chicken & noodles chicken soup this recipe and others. Really brings out the flavor!",This was AMAZING! My family kept raving how good it was. Like others before me I boiled the veggies and the chicken in the chicken broth. When the chicken was done I saute'd it in butter with garlic onions salt and pepper. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup because I needed more gravy. There was so much meat and veggies that I put it in a 9x13 pan and topped it with two pilsbury already made dough. I brushed the top of the dough with egg white and it came out so wonderful! What a recipe. I will be making this again and again. Update - I made this with left over roast from last nights meal and it was amazing. I used beef broth and also a jar of beef gravy so we'd have extra. My kids liked it better then the chicken pot pie.,I've been making this for years now and I've adjusted the recipe as follows: 1) I double the sauce recipe as others suggest 2) I add in poultry seasoning garlic powder and chili powder to the sauce to taste 3) I just use a 16oz package of frozen mixed veggies and a diced potato. I boil these in broth with the chicken 4) After the sauce has thickened I dump the chicken and veggies (after draining) into the saucepan and stir it all together before putting it in my pie. Doubling the sauce and adding extra veggies gives me a little leftover filling when I do a regular deep dish pie (I'm ok with this though as I happily eat the filling on its own). However usually I make 2 dozen mini pies in my muffin tin cooking for 20 minutes. I love these mini pies because I'm constantly on the run and can eat them with one hand without a fork and knife!,This recipe was wonderful! It definately puts the frozen pot pies to shame. I only did one thing differently after reading others reviews saying that the bottom crust was soggy. I beat an egg white and brushed it on the bottom crust before putting in the filling. It worked great! I also brushed it on the top crust as well. It was SO delicious!,This is five stars but you need to add 1/4tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning like another reviewer suggested. This adds that missing flavor. Also I baked the bottom pie shell for 7 minutes and then added the filling. Overall yummy yummy!,Excellent! A keeper! I added cubed potato and boiled the chicken & veggies in chicken broth rather than water. I also added garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the sauce mixture. So yummy my mother-in-law couldn't stop raving!,As far as chicken pot pie recipes go this one is a winner! 1st time I made it the pie was INCREDIBLY dry the 2nd time I tripled the sauce added cubed yukon gold potates poultry seasoning and used a deep dish pie pan. Baked the bottom crust 7-10 minutes to keep it from getting soggy and absorbing all the sauce. MUCH better!!! This is also a great recipe for freezing take it out of the freezer in the morning let it defrost in the oven set your time bake and you'll have a ready home made meal when you walk in the door from work! Enjoy it's a great dish!,I made this recipe because it was almost the same as one I usually make. My family loves it but I decided to look here for something different this year. I guess pot pies are pretty much timeless and the recipes don't change much so I just went with this one. This isn't really that different from mine... LOL so I kinda followed it but used my years of experience to make it more to our liking.:) The things I changed where... I did dice and cook one medium sized potato first. Cooked drained and then put it aside. I cooked my celery with the onions in the butter. then stirred in the flour (way less than the suggested amount) and then chicken stock. I added about a 1/4 to a 1/2 of poultry seasoning (Bell's seasoning actually) to the gravy mixture. I then added the chicken and frozen veggies and simmered just until heated through. I let the mixture cool slightly before pouring into the bottom shell. The biggest complaints I've seen about this recipe is the dryness. In my opinion that's because there is way too much flour being used for the slightly more than 2 cups of liquid. I reduced the flour to about 2 1/2 or 3 TBLS and I had no problem with the recipe coming out dry. I did not have to add extra liquid. I just reduced the flour. Lastly... I made this in a 13x9 pan. I can't say how long it took to cook. I just kept an eye on it. Maybe a 1/2 hour to 45 minutes??? I just cooked it until the crust looked done:),This is a great recipe. The first time I made it exactly as described and my family really liked it. Now my favorite way to make it is with leftovers. After I roast a chicken or turkey I save the drippings to use instead of a can of broth it makes a richer gravy. I store the drippings in the fridge so that I can easily remove the fat. I use the cooked chicken or turkey and just add it to the vegetables after they are done. I always make mashed potatoes and I spread some in the bottom of the pie plate instead of using pie crust. Then I layer the vegetable/chicken mixture and cover with the gravy and finally top it with pie crust. My husband and sons devour it this way. I have to make two just to have enough.,I am rating the concept of this recipe. I was a die hard start with a whole chicken make your own broth person. This recipe made it okay for me to take short cuts. I did tweak it a bit. -Homemade pie crust. -cooked chicken and veggies in broth and saved it for sauce after. -increased butter onions and flour to 1/2c and increased broth and milk to total of 3c. Thank you for submitting a recipe that made my life a little simpler.,Amazing! Made this today and it is wonderful. It seems everyone tweaks this a tad sometimes out of necessity here's my tweaks: (most of this is all going on at the same time): I had two frozen pie crusts that I set out to thaw. Instead of boiling (I think it makes the meat too bland) I sauteed two big boneless skinless chicken breasts in a little olive oil over LOW heat I salted them and put some garlic powder and black pepper on them too. Covered them as they were cooking so the meat would be really soft almost boiled. Let the meat rest for 10 min before I shredded it. Had a bag of frozen peas/carrots/green beans/corn that I lightly boiled in just enough broth to cover them for 5 minutes. Sauteed chopped onion and 2 finely minced garlic cloves in a little olive oil for 20 min- LOW-med heat don't let that garlic burn! Baked one of my thawed out crusts (the one to be used as the bottom) for 5 minutes. And the sauce.. pretty much followed the recipe's directions to a T. Note: some people stated the mixture to be runny... let your sauce cook on low heat for awhile it can take half an hour to thicken just keep in on low heat and keep stirring. It WILL thicken. I cooked mine to the consistency of gravy. Taste your sauce it should taste as salty as you want your pie to taste if not add more salt! Note: when u put on the top crust and seal it together brush on a little melted butter it makes it brown nicely. Outstanding w/ a green salad and sweet iced tea!,Delicious - Thanks for the recipe! I followed the others suggestions reduced the heat to 375 degrees and cooked the bottom pie crust (after brushing egg white on it) for 6 minutes before filling with chicken mixture. I added cubed potatoes to my chicken/vegetables and seasoned them with seasoned salt. I then boiled them in chicken broth. I drained the chicken/vegetables after about 15 minutes but reserved the chicken broth to add to the sauce mixture. I also added creamed corn and 1/2 teaspon of garlic powder to the sauce mixture. Once the sauce was done I mixed it with the chicken/vegetable mixture and added it to the pie crust. I topped it with the pie crust brushed it with egg whites and cooked it for about 40 to 45 minutes. Awesome!,Excellent Recipe. Just what I was looking for. The only alteration I made was by adding small cubed potatoes cooked for about 8 min. before adding to mixture (just long enough to take the crunch out of them; they will cook the rest of the way in the oven). This is the only chicken pot pie recipe Ill be using from now on!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"We love this recipe and I keep finding new ways to modify it (I feel I have to, since I make it at LEAST once a week)This is how we like it: I use celery seed rather than celery salt and usually have parmesan-romano cheese blend on hand so I use that. I also add 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes. I don't add any lemon juice anymore (I used to just reduce it by half) but now use low-fat mayo that I find to be quite tangy. I also double the amount of pepper and add about 1/2 c. of bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, which creates a nice texture and keeps the topping in place. Seasoning the fish with a bit of Old Bay seasoning, as others have done, really adds to the flavor as well. Thank you for helping us eat fish on a regular basis, Phoebe!","I made some changes to this recipe to lower some of the fat content but I still think it was delicious and deserved five stars. Instead of using regular mayo and butter, I substituted fat free mayo and light butter. I also sprayed the fillets with olive oil cooking spray before placing them under the broiler. Since tilapia cooks quickly, I didn't turn them at all. I let them cook 3 or 4 minutes (oven rack on second slot from the top), added the cheese mixture, and removed them when the cheese started to brown.","I've made this several times and this is absolutely the easiest and best tilapia, or any fish, dish I have ever made. Everyone I make it for wants the recipe. I do line a broiler pan with foil and spray the foil with cooking spray. The only other thing I do differently is to sprinkle the fish with Old Bay Seasoning before putting under the broiler for the first time and then again before topping with the parmesan mix while it is out of the oven. I also make sure that I start with the side of the fish that has the dark vein running through the center facing up starting out then it should end up on the bottom when finished. Low fat mayo makes it even more healthy than it already is without making a big difference. I've found it best to follow the cooking time closely. It's quick. It's tasty. Try it!","Excellent! Hubby declared, ""best fish ever, let's have it next week""... Only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 tsp garlic powder (because we love garlic) and 1/4 tsp paprika. The paprika really gave it a nice flavor and added a wonderful color to the cheese sauce. We will definitely be making this often.","I scaled this recipe in half and went with some of the suggestions of reviewer, Shannon:) (click on ""most helpful"" and you'll see her review). I've only had tilapia once and wasn't that impressed with that fresh-water, farmed fish, so I went with rockfish (aka: red snapper in warmer waters; rockfish in colder northern waters). I added to the parmesan mixture: some garlic powder, paprika, a touch of cayenne pepper & some panko bread crumbs. This cheese mixture is really what makes the dish; it was excellent and I liked the way the bread crumbs/cheese browned lightly under the broiler. I only had to broil the fish 2 minutes on each side, plus 2 minutes with the cheese mixture. Served with steamed broccoli. Talk about an easy, quick-prep meal! Thanks, Phoebe!","I was really desperate for something to do with some recently defrosted tilapia fillets and spotted this recipe and it looked interesting. My husband loved it. Loved the texture, the zing of the parmesan and spice was just perfect. Will definitely make again for family & friends. Only issue was I made the spread and put it in the fridge for 1/2 hr. early and it melted way too fast in the broiler. Lost 1/2 the topping. My error. Don't recommend chilling spread 1st.","Have made this on several occasions trying to find the right balance of cheese mixture to fish. The first time I made the recipe exactly as stated (as a courteous nod to the submitter) and it swam in butter so I rated this at three stars (wonderful but loaded with calories). The second time, I reduced the butter again to an 1/8 cup and it was still overpowered by the butter, so try, try again to one tablespoon of butter for the perfect mixture. Wonderful flavor!!!","We're fish lovers, so maybe that's what influenced our opinion of this dish. The sauce is pungent and overpowers the delicate tilapia. It would work better on a fish with more substance and flavor to it. Tilapia is best served by lightly dressing it with olive oil, real butter and lemon juice, lightly salted and broiled. We won't want this again.",My husband and I loved this dish. It was so fast and easy. I didn't have any celery salt so I added garlic powder. I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!,I've made this twice and it is awesome and sooo easy. I would make it any day for my picky seafood eating freinds. The second time I used sour cream because we were out of mayo and it was as good if not better.,"Very easy and flavorful. Makes plenty of topping, I actually used about 1-1/2 times the amount of tilapia called for with no problems.",This recipe is great--I've already made it twice! I put each piece of fish in a foil packet (make sure you spray your foil first so the fish doesn't stick!) and then spread the topping on. Fold up the packet and grill for about 20 minutes...turns out perfectly and doesn't make the kitchen smell like fish!,"What a quick and tasty recipe! Tried this tonight, and dealing with my 3 year old ""trying to help"" me in the kitchen took me longer than the actual prep and cook...I read a lot of the reviews, and changed this about the recipe. Added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, a 1/4 of paprika and 1/2 cup of panko crumbs. I didn't have non stick spray or olive oil, so I just spritzed the foil covered cookie sheet with some butter spray, and lightly seasoned the fillets with some old bay seasoning. I broiled vein side down for 4 minutes, topped with cheese/crumb mix, and broiled for another 3...came out great and the family inhaled it! Now warning, if you don't like parmesan cheese, then don't use this recipe, it's a predominant flavor..And tilapia is a mild, somewhat delicate fish, that benefited from the stronger taste of the topping. And although I did change the origianl recipe to suit my tastes, I still give it a deserved 5 stars, for without the basis of the original recipe, I wouldn't have anything to build off of...",This recipe is similar to a halibut recipe that I make. I omitted celery salt since I didnt have any but other than that I followed recipe. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes. Perfect.,"This is a delicious tilapia recipe. I seasoned the filets on both sides with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, and seasoned salt before putting the topping on them. No need for all the mayo and butter--adjust however you want. I also added some bread crumbs to get a crispier topping.","I have similar version of this recipe that will knock your socks off! You line the bottom of a baking dish with sliced tomatoes, sprinkle about 1/2 cup of chopped Kalamata olives, add some lemon zest and squeeze lemon juice over the top and add salt and pepper. Then lay the tilapia pieces over the top and spread the mayo-parmesean mix over the fish and bake at 450 for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. It is AWESOME!",This is great. I added a 1/2 tsp. of Horseradish to kick it up.,My husband really liked it; a nice way to dress up fish.,"This is an excellent recipe. I had no celery salt, so subbed a bit of garlic salt, and used Smart Balance instead of butter. It turned out fine. Next time I will try low-fat mayo. I only had a pound of fish because there are just two of us, but made the full amount of topping -- which was great on cooked cauliflower.","I've made this recipe at least a dozen times since I first found it. It's excellent and family and friends are crazy about it! One snowy day last year, I wanted to make it but had no tilapia. I used chicken cutlets instead and it was just as good.","As if this recipe needed any more reviews. It was great. I subbed dill for basil and used garlic salt instead of celery salt and added a little old bay. My husband and I both enjoyed it. 2 year old not so much, but that is expected. update 12/14/06:I changed up a bit the second time and added a few bread crumbs on top. Much better this way and 2 yr old loved it.","This is a wonderful base recipe! As I am a cook who does not always use exact measurements I made the following adjustments: Banged up some garlic crotons, Parmesan/Romano shredded cheese blend, Tony Chachere's Seasoning, Old Bay, Miracle Whip, and a little extra butter than called for (made extra topping). Topped the fish with that magical combo (most important do not over broil) and it was delectable. In the words of the infamous Rachael Ray...YUM-O!!! Served with egg noodles tossed with the extra topping and steamed broccoli. People could not get enough of this; so now I make it all the time!","This recipe is awesome. My son loved it and so did I. I made this with about a pound of tilapia, therefore I had extra sauce. I used the extra sauce in my rice pilaf. Dinner was a wonderful eating experience.","After over a 100 sterling reviews of this tilapia my two cents doesn't seem necessary, but for the doubters I would have to agree this is pretty darn tasty. So simple. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't alter any of the ingredients. I did add a pinch extra parmesan, but really, can you ever have too much parmesan? The flavor was excellent, prep time a breeze and all diners at my house were pleased and cleaned their plates. I will make this again and recommend others try it too! Tilapia can taste so boring, but this recipe added the punch it needs without an overpowering flavor. Yummy.",Great recipe! My wife even loved it...,I have made this three times and will make it again tonight. I used 1lb. of tilapia and added a little more lemon juice. I think I will add lump crab meat to the mixture the next time.,I got to say im really a fish lover and always looking for new recipes this one is A number (1) loved it...,"I'm not a big fish eater, but the wife & kids are, so as the cook in the family I make at least one fish recipe a week. This is probably THE only way I actually ENJOY eating the fish! I make the topping as stated, but add a little extra Parmigiano-Reggiano on top of mine (I'm a huge parm fan)","This is one of the best broiled fish dishes I have had. Every Lenten Season I struggle with how to cook fish. (We don't really eat it the rest of the year. I like fish, I just don't know what to do with it.) This recipe is very fast and easy. The only thing I think it needed extra was a little more salt. The 1/8 tsp. celery salt wasn't enough for our tastes. This recipe is definately a keeper not only for Lent, but for the rest of the year as well. Thank you for submitting this recipe.","Loved it! I am doing Weight Watchers so I made the following modifications: sprinkled garlic salt directly on the tilapia and gave it a squeeze of lemon before broiling. Broiled 2 min per side, then added a lighter version of the topping: sprayed each filet with with a few shots of ""I Can't Believe it's not Butter"" spray, dabbed each piece with a bit of MIracle Whip, tossed on a scant sprinkle of fresh parmesan, added a little fresh-ground pepper and another squeeze of lemon. Broiled 2 more min for a delicious, quick, and very healthy dinner!","OH MY..this was delicious. My picky husband, who's not a big fish fan had 2 servings..and I had 2-1/2. I absolutely loved the parmesan topping. Since tilapia is a mild flavored fish, the cheese topping really came through. Will definitely be adding this into my seafood rotation. Thanks so much Phoebe.","My oven was being replaced, so I had to adjust the directions. I pan-seared the fish in a very small amt. of butter...cooked on both sides just a few minutes, then added the sauce over the fish. I then cooked only long enough for the sauce to be gently heated. My husband's comment ""this is company good!""","Modified Review. We loved this seasoning blend so much that I had to try frying the Tilapia. In a large, deep, skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and mayonnaise. Beat together one egg plus one tablespoon of water and 1/8 tsp salt. Dredge filets in egg wash, then bread/cheese mixture and place in skillet and fry, uncovered, for approximately 4 minutes per side (until fish flakes easily with fork). Remove to paper towel lined plate for a moment before placing on a platter. YUM! Original Review: Add 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/8 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, and use celery seed instead of celery salt. If you want to prepare and refrigerate the seasoning/cheese/breading mixture ahead of time, it cuts your “Ready” time – start to finish – to 10 minutes! Size of the filets will affect broil time; I used very small (2 ounce) tilapia filets, and found the perfect broil time was 6 minutes.","WoW!!!! The reviews are true, this was very very good, so good I had it sat and sun. I cooked as stated with the exception of celery salt, I used garlic powder and it work out fine. I did lightly season my fish with old bay and I did not use as much mayo as called for and it was just enough. Whatever you do cook as time states DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO COOK LONGER!!!. Oh yea I almost forgot I also lightly top my dish with Italian bread crumbs YUM!!!! DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP. UPDATE!!!! I CAN'T STOP MAKING THIS, REALLY GOOD FOLKS.","Holy smokes! Just made this tonight and it was absolutely fantastic! My husband has been indifferent to tilapia in the past while my son and I have always loved it BUT tonight we ALL loved it. Hubby is now a fan and son thinks we should have it 6 nights a week. The only changes I made were to season with Jonny's seafood seasoning before broiling, ditched the mayo in favor of non fat yogurt and cut the butter amount in half. This dish DID NOT suffer for the changes. It honestly taste like something you would get at a nice seafood restaurant. Thanks for sharing such a special recipe. It is now in permanent rotation at our house!",This was my first try at making tilapia and it was delicious! I left out the celery salt as Parmesan is salty enough already and used a bit of garlic powder instead. I served with plain egg noodles for all that extra sauce. Yum! Thank you for this great recipe!,Wow...My whole family loved this dish. My son told me I didn't make enough sauce since we used the extra to spread all over the fish and rice. This is a simple easy recipe that I will use again and again. I didn't have celery salt on hand so I substituded with celery seed and kosher salt. Very yummy!!!!,FIXED THIS FOR EASTER AS MY DAUGHTER DOES NOT EAT RED MEAT... EVERYONE LOVED THIS... COOKED OUT ON THE GRILL... THIS IS A KEEPER,Wonderful flavor! This has become a family favorite! Thanks for the great recipe,It was an okay recipe.,"This is great. I spared the spices with salt, added some smashed capers and used fresh herbs from my garden. Served over a bed of basmati rice, it looked and tasted delicious! **** Later addition to review: I've also had great success adding quartered or chopped artichoke hearts to the topping mixture. Can't get enough!",Family loved this recipe! Used grouper instead of tilapia.,"I REDEEMED MYSELF BY MAKING THIS FOR MY HUSBAND! HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! THE ONLY THING, I ONLY USED 1 LB OF TALAPIA, BUT USED ALL THE SPREAD... DEFINATELY WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!",
21,I have made this recipe at least 15 times. What I have found that the best cut of meat to use is a tri-tip roast. There is no need to brown the meat but I do recommend triming off as much fat as possible. One problem I had was that there was always too much gravy left over. I have recently discovered that this recipe comes out just as spectacular using one can of soup and half a can of water. Do use the regular amount of onion soup mix. It should be cooked to perfection in about six hours. I also have a suggestion on the type of slowcooker used. I first tried making this recipe in a small Nesco but it was not able to keep the roast completely immersed in the soup mixture. I use a Rival. It is 7 inches wide and about 5 inches deep. This is the most typical slowcooker around. Finally a word on adding vegetables. I tried adding carrots and potatoes to this recipe and for some reason the gravy was not very flavorful. For this reason I just leave them out. Good luck!,"If you are looking for the perfect roast recipe then look no further! I read pages and pages of the reviews & then took some of the suggestions and modified the recipe a bit. The result was spectacular – I will be making this dish again and again. Since there are just two of us I bought a 2.5 lb chuck roast and I lightly covered with a mixture of flour, garlic salt and dried rosemary and then seared all sides with a bit of unsalted butter. I added baby carrots, sweet onion, small red potatoes and celery. For the gravy I combined 2 cans of 99%fat free cream of mushroom soup, ½ a packet of onion soup mix, 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce, ¼ cup of red wine and 1 cup of beef broth & cooked on high for 4 hours and low for 2 hours. The meat was so tender and the gravy was absolutely delectable. It was a bit thin so I just thickened up with a bit of flour. I served with cheese risotto (Safeway brand) and French bread. I can honestly say this was one of the best meals I’ve ever made…. HIGHLY recommend.","OK.... I tried this recipe using a 4 lb. angus bottom round roast, and after reading all the reviews that said the gravy needed to be thickened. I decided to flour the roast with flour, granulated garlic, salt and pepper. Then I browned it on all sides in a little olive oil. While it was browning on the stove, I added the rest of the ingredients to the slow cooker, I also put in two 4 oz. cans of mushrooms. However, I substituded the water for beef broth (same amount) and when the roast was done browning, I put it in the slow cooker and covered it with the mixture in the slow cooker. I also cooked it on low for 4 hours then high for the rest of the time. It came out VERY tender. No need to thicken the gravy, because the flour thickened it while it was cooking. My picky 12 yr old daughter (who eats like a bird) ate some for dinner, then again when she got home that night, and my 9 yr old son asked me to make this more often. I served it with mashed potatoes and canned corn. It was the easiest pot roast I ever made!!","BADA-BING! I have been making this recipe for quite some time now, with the exception of the cream of mushroom soup. The soup adds that OOMPH to the gravy that I have been looking for! I used beef broth instead of the water, & added 2 TBSP of corn starch to thicken it up before serving. In the last 3 hours cooking in the crock pot I added fresh carrots, green beans, potatoes & sliced onions. YUM! The family LOVES it & when my neighbors find out I'm making it, they always take dibs on the leftovers! Thanks Brenda!!","I wasn't able to follow this recipe, since I didn't have the soup and onion mix. But I wanted to add a tip that makes cooking in a crockpot SO much easier. Line the crockpot with a Reynold's oven cooking bag, Turkey size, or smaller depending on the size of your crockpot. Cooking time is the same. Then the best part, clean up. Just remove the ingredients, lift out the bag, and your done! The crockpot remains clean.","Best tasting pot roast I ever had. To make it a little healthier, I cooked it all day on low and then refrigerated it. The next evening I was able to peel off over a 1"" layer of beef fat that had hardened on the top and reheat the pot roast in the oven. I realize this defeated the 'dinner ready when you get home' purpose of a crockpot but this process removed at least 1000 calories from the dish and it still tasted fantastic!",Just an additional note to say that it's important to sear the meat on all sides before adding to the crockpot- it only takes a few minutes and really helps to seal in the juices of the meat. I made it yesterday and forgot to sear the meat first. Still tasted good but not nearly as moist as when I've seared the roast first. Enjoy!,"I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, and Lawry's Seasoning Salt. I browned the roast on all sides in a hot skillet with a little olive oil in it. I transfered the roast to the slow cooker. I added the water to the skillet and scraped up all the bits and pieces of meat that have so much flavor. I substituted a package of dry ""au jus"" mix for the onion soup mix and blended this and the mushroom soup with the water in the skillet. I put sliced onions on top of the roast, added some minced garlic, and poured the liquid over the roast. The longer you cook it, the better it gets. It is a family favorite ~","This recipe is excellent and you can't really tell canned cream of mushroom soup was used for gravy. A couple of things I substitute is an envelope of pre-packaged ""pot roast"" seasoning (McCormick's Bag 'n Season) instead of onion soup mix, and red burgundy wine instead of water. I also add diced yukon gold potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and sliced onions at the bottom of the crockpot. Cooking time for a 4-lb. roast is usually 9 hours on Low and the longer the better. I thicken the gravy slightly with cornstarch and water at the very end. Overall, very very good!","This is the best!!!! The whole house had a wonderful aroma all day. It is the best roast I have ever had and probably the easiest. I did not brown the meat ,but rubbed the roast with cajun spice. I used cream of chicken and a can of french onion , 1 pkg dry beefy onion and used a coke instead of the water. I can't wait to make it again!!!!Thanks Thanks Thanks to Brenda","This is absolutely fantastic! For this recipe, I typically use about 4 to 4 1/2 lbs of Beef Chuck Pot Roast Boneless (trim off a little of the fat) and for a family of four, this makes a two-day meal. I tweaked the recipe by using two cans of Cream of Mushroon Roasted Garlic and added beef buillion to the water. For the roast itself, I patted both sides with garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, black pepper, and flour. Then, I brown it in olive oil. All the ingredients go into the crockpot and cooks on high for 2 hours, then I add one white onion (quartered) and an 8 oz package of button mushrooms (sliced thin). It then cooks on low for 4 1/2 to 5 hours. I thicken the gravy with 2 TB of cornstarch. The first night I pair half of the roast and sauce with mashed potatoes. For the next day, I take the other half of the dish and add about 1 cup of sour cream, a pound of cooked egg noodles, and 1/4 cup of chopped green onions to make a very tasty, simple, yet different dish--beef stroganoff! Absolutely delicious meals for any two nights of the week!","This is a great, tried and true, reliable recipe for slow cooker roast that I've used more times over many years than I can count...and continue to go back to. It also works equally as well with a pork roast. Variations, of course, are endless, and I'm sure everyone will come up with their favorite way to make this. I always dredge a 3-4 pound roast in flour first, salt and peppered, then brown it on all sides in about 1/4 cup of butter. This adds so much to the flavor, and gives the roast great color as well. I use one can of cream of mushroom soup, one package of the dry onion soup mix, and 1/2 cup dry white wine -- no water at all! Tender, delicious, and gives your whole house a wonderful, homey smell in the process!","I thought maybe I did something wrong when I made this and it turned out terrible, but when my mom tried it and mentioned her horrible results, I decided it wasn't just me. I don't know why the reviews are so high, but this recipe isn't that great. The only thing that's great is that it's easy and quick to assemble. The flavor is pretty weak and the gravy was awful. I would never make this again and would rather do the extra work to have a roast that tastes yummy with gravy that IS gravy.","After reading and learning from most of the reviews I changed the recipe very slighlty and WOW, what a dish!!! I made this on mother's day for my mother in law and the entire family inhaled the dish within a blink of an eye. I marinated the tip roast the night before with minced garlic, pepper, and onion powder. The next day I slighlty browned the beef on all sides to lock in the flavors. I added half a cup of red wine and half a cup of beef broth, which replaced the cup of water. I added an onion and two garlic cloves on top. Also, I let it soo on low for about 9 hours. I made 6 pounds, but had no left overs!!!! Imagine that... My husband asked me to make some more just three days later!! Thanks everyone for your many tips and suggestions!! I still can't beleive that I impressed my mother in law!","I've made this a few times and I think I've just about perfected it (for me anyway)- just thought I'd share what I do: I flour a 5lb chuck roast (with the twine on) in a mix of season-all, pepper and flour and brown it all over. Then I plop it in the slow cooker. I deglaze the pan with a splash of zinfandel (any bold red wine will do - zinfandel or cabernet), scraping up all the brownings, then add another cup of the wine, mix in the package of dry onion soup mix, throw in a can of beef broth and a can of cream of mushroom soup, pour that over the roast. Add onions, potatoes and carrots all around and on top, and throw in a few sprigs of thyme, put the lid on and let it go all day. When I get home I remove the roast and veggies, cut off the twine, throw away the thyme sprigs and cook the liquid with more of the flour blend until I get a rich gravy. I serve with buttermilk biscuits. SO SO SO FABULOUS!!!!!","I read a BUNCH of reviews, and then did this....Used 1 can of Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup. Mixed it with 1 envelope of Lipton Onion soup mix, 1/2 cup beef broth, and 2 Tbsp. worchestershire sauce. Generously sprinkled Montreal Steak seasoning all over a 5 lb. bottom round roast, then coated it in flour. Browned it on all sides, put it in the crockpot. De-glazed saute pan with 1/2 cup beef broth. Poured the onion soup mix over/around the roast, then poured the de-glazing liquid over that. Cooked on LOW for 8 hours. FABULOUS!! The roast was super-tender, but not mushy (you could still cut it into slices). Perfect amount of gravy (about 1 quart) with a nice meaty, ""brown"" flavor, with no need to thicken up with flour or cornstarch. One of the best comfort foods there is! To sum up other's suggestions...only one can of soup? YES!! GOLDEN MUSHROOM soup? YES!! Monteal Steak seasoning? YES!! Dredge roast in flour? YES!! Beef broth instead of water? YES!! Don't add veggies to this dish? YES!! Try this recipe this way (add mashed potatoes, veggies etc. seperately, keeping the meat and gravy tasting, well, like meat and gravy should!). You will love it!!","Awesome!! After reading numerous reviews, I followed the advice of others. I floured, seasoned and browned my half-frozen roast (which was 3/5 lbs.), used the same amount of gravy ingredients, also added 4 cloves minced garlic and worcestershire sauce. About half way through I added a chopped onion. I let it cook on low for about 10 hrs. It was juicy and fell apart. The gravy was fantastic (especially on garlic mashed potatoes). I'm not a huge roast fan, nor do I like mushrooms but I served this for company and everyone (including kids from 5-16 yrs.) kept raving. Thank you, this is a definite keeper!","I made this recipe for my family and they thought this was awesome, by far the best pot roast I've made. I did make some revisions, taking into account comments of previous raters. I added a 2 lb bag of baby carrots (probably could of just used 1 pound), 6 or 7 small whole red potatoes, 4 quartered onions, several chopped celery sticks, 4 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic (we LOVE garlic), 3/4 c. red wine instead of the water (DEFINITELY a good suggestion), crushed peppercorns, 3 bay leaves. I mixed the wine and soups together, poured some of the mixture over the veggies, then put the meat in, then poured the rest of the soup mixture on the meat. Finish with plenty of crushed peppercorns over the top!! I also cooked it for 6 hours. Definitely the BEST I've ever tasted.","This recipe is not only very user friendly it is delicious. It comes out nice and tender-full of flavor. Obviously you can cut recipe in half if you are not having guests. I added carrots, celery, potatoes, and mushrooms about 2 hours before serving. Just dont add them too early on or they will get mushy. :)","I've made this recipe several times, it is just that good!!!! The first time I try a recipe (especially if I rate it!!!) I always follow the recipe to a ""T"".... and the next time I modify it to suit my taste. I've rated this 5 stars ""as is"" for ease and deliciousness!!! It's fantastic as written.... I've done some things differently along the way though: I use beef broth instead of water, and I season and sear the meat before adding to the crockpot. One thing about this recipe is it makes ALOT of gravy.... So what??? I take the leftover gravy and freeze it! Our fav use for the leftover gravy is to put it in a saute pan, stir in about a 1/4 cup of sour cream, heat it up with some oven baked meatballs and serve it over egg noodles, with a salad on the side! My 9 year old eats it up! But I digress... :) Bottom line: this is wonderful as written but you can definitely tailor it to your tastes! I love recipes like that! :))","FANTASTIC POT ROAST I read through the reviews to get an idea of what I was going to do, I used a 3 1/2 lb chuck roast or O bone. I seasoned with garlic salt, pepper and onion powder. Browned the roast first before putting into crock pot. In the pan I browned the roast in I mixed two cans of cream of mushroom soup and one can of french onion soup & 2 garlic cloves. After heating through, I poured it over the roast in the crock pot put it on high until it started to boil then put on low for the balance of cooking time which was 6 hours. It shredded just like I wanted it and the gravy was awesome. Thanks Brenda","Great recipe, although I admit I monkeyed with it. I browned the meat a bit before putting it in. I also added * two onions, halved * 1 tsp marjaram * 1 tsp thyme * 1/2 tsp dried oregano leaves * 3 cloves garlic, sliced (for three lbs of meat) And I substituted a combination of red wine and beef broth for the water. I also added potatoes and baby carrots about halfway through cooking. The end result was incredibly flavorful; my husband isn't a beef fan, but went back for seconds and asked me to make it again! Thanks so much to other reviewers who suggested some of the above additions.",Based on the other reviews I changed the recipe a little to add more flavor. I omitted the water and wisked beef broth with the mushroom soup to make the gravy. I added an onion to the bottom of the pot and I season the meat with seasoning salt and pepper. I added rosemary and thyme to the gravy. The result was absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!,"Great recipe. I don't use ""cream of"" soups any longer, instead I melt 1/4 c of butter then add 1/4 c of flour and mix for about a minute then add 1 c of milk. This makes an excellent alternative to the cream of anything soups. I've used this successfully in green bean casserole as well with perfect results. (recipe stated replaces one regular sized can of cream of ""whatever"" soup.)","This was the best pot roast I've ever had. I used a 2.75 lb. chuck roast. I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Then I rolled it in flour and browned it in a skillet. While that was going, I mixed a whole packet of onion soup mix, one can of cream of mushroom soup, and 2 cups of beef bouillon in the slow cooker. Once the roast was nice and brown, I put it in and cooked it from 11:00-1:00 on high (my mom's idea) and from 1:00-5:30 on low. The roast fell apart and was super moist. I had lots of gravy, so I served it over rice. I will make this again soon!","As with others, I made changes to the recipe based upon what was available and what other reviewers wrote. There were wonderful tips from everyone which was helpful for a first time slow cooker. First, the condensed cream of mushroom soup was the 98% fat free kind. Secondly, after browning the meat (dredged in flour), I added olive oil to the ""drippings"" and sauteed fresh mushrooms, onions, garlic and celery -- added a few tblsp of white balsamic vinegar and a splash of red wine for good measure. This was poured over the meat in the slow cooker. Used the dry onion soup mix as instructed and beef broth replaced the water. Cooked on high for 2 hours and on low overnight. The roast turned out delightful. The broth/sauce was the star. Absolutely wonderful. Am saving some to bring to my dad.","My husband said that this is the best meal he's had in a very long time. The meat fell apart it was so tender. I halved the recipe because I only had a 2 1/2lb roast. I rubbed the roast with garlic salt and pepper and browned all sides in a frying pan before putting it in the slow cooker and used low fat soup instead of regular, red wine in place of half the water, and a pinch of thyme. After taking out the roast I skimmed most of the fat off the top of the soup mixture and then poured the soup mixture into a saucepan, brought it to a boil and whisked in a flour/water mixture to thicken it up. It made an incredible gravy. I served roasted potatoes and carrots with it. I will make this very often.","I'm amazed at some of the reviews that indicate others have had trouble with this--it is SO GOOD! I usually use a smaller roast because the largest I can ever find where I shop is about 3#. I also use 3 cans cream of mushroom soup (because we like lots of gravy for our mashed potatoes) and only about 1/2 of the envelope of dry soup mix so it won't be quite so salty. I think it's about a heaping 1/8 cup. Then I cut back on the water--about 2/3 cup, otherwise the gravy is too runny for my liking. I make this all the time--the family loves it!","I keep making this over and over... Amazingly easy and it makes my husband ecstatic! I use beef broth instead of water, my only change...","Delicious recipe! So tender it fell apart trying to get it out of the slow cooker! I only used 2 1/2 pounds of roast as my pot is very small. I seasoned the roast with garlic and pepper before placing into slow cooker. I cooked on high for the first 2 hours, then low for the remaining 6 hours. I went ahead and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, as I wanted plenty of gravy to completely cover the roast. I also took the advice of another reviewer and placed into pot while frozen. Hubby and boys loved it!! This is now in my recipe box! Thank you for the great, easy recipe, Brenda! I have recommended this recipe to a friend, and she's off to the store as I type!","I just made this roast today and not only was it the best roast I've ever made, I believe it was the best I've ever tasted! I followed some of the comments of some other reviewers as well as my own prior cooking experience and made the following alterations to the recipe: 1) Mix about 1/3 cup flour with plenty of salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic salt, and then coat the roast in the mixture. 2) Brown the roast in a frying pan with olive oil on medium-high heat. 3) Substitute a can of beef broth for the water and add it to the slow cooker with the mushroom soup and onion soup mix. Add 1/3 cup of (good) red wine and 1 Tbs of worcestershire sauce, then mix them all together. 4) Add the browned roast and cook on low for 8 hours. I also let it cool overnight in the refridgerator, then skimmed off the excess fat before reheating the portion for tonight's dinner. The roast was excellent and the gravy was simply amazing smothered over some homemade mashed potatoes!","I've used a variation of this recipe for many years. I use a tri-tip roast when they go on sale at the grocery store. I have found the tri-tip cooks up very tender and flakes apart in your mouth. Instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup I usually use Golden Mushroom Soup. Last night I tried the recipe with Cream of Mushroom soup and folowed the recipe exactly except I added a dash of Worchestershire sauce and reduced the water to only 1 cup and served over rice. I served it to family and friends and it was a HUGE hit! The gravy it makes is to die for! Even the kids asked for seconds and more gravy! Very simple to prepare and very, very tasty! We will be having this often at our house!","Delicious! I made this recipe for six adults and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. As a matter of fact, my husband said I could make it for him ANYTIME! I did do a couple of specific things: 1). I seasoned my chuck roast with salt, pepper and Lawry's. Then I seared it before putting it into the slow cooker for about nine hours. I think the seasoning and searing helped in sealing the flavor and juices. 2). I used the McCormick Pot Roast seasoning packet instead of onion soup mix. And I added some minced garlic. The meat was so tender and tasty. I just wished I would have made more. The recipe calls for between 4 and 5 pounds of beef. But it REALLY shrinks down. I should have used closer to 6 or 6.5 pounds. It still was delicious. Thanks for the great recipe Brenda.","I needed a quick and easy recipe for pot roast, and this one is it. The recipe listed, does not include vegetables, so I added my own potatoes, carrots, onion, and celery. I put my large 6 pound roast in a 6 qt crockpot, added the ingredients in no specific order, set the crock on high, and in about 8 hours, I had a pot roast like my Mom used to make. The flavor is quite good, even if you don't ""doctor"" it up with added spices, but if you want a really lucious gravy with your potroast, add a couple tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken it up nicely. For people who work the night shift, who are single, or for anyone who wants a quick and delicious dinner sure to impress, this is the one. For those people who have complained about the appearance of this meal...well, its POT ROAST, not pheasant under glass. I would rate this as one of the tastiest, and easiest dishes I have ever made, and will do it again, when I am needing some good comfort food. Excellent recipe.","Although my measly little review will never be viewed in the midst of these hundreds of reviews, I had to write and say THANKS! This is so easy to prepare before running out the door in the morning and I have a wonderfully delicious winter meal waiting for me when I get home from work.",I made this yesterday and it was fabulous. I used a 4 lb. chuck roast and cooked it on low for 6 hours. I think the fact that I had a really good roast helped. I should've taken the roast out about a 1/2 earlier. The sauce was very good. I didn't have the patience to make a gravy so I spooned a little on my serving of meat and potatoes. It was very tasy and the roast was extremely tender. My fussy fiance has enjoyed every recipe I've used on this site and am enjoying them myself!,,,,,,,,
22,Super Easy! I liked it but my husband didn't...figures,This recipe is AWESOME with a few modifications. I made it for my mom husband 3 year-old and 8 month old and it was a HUGE hit with all of us! My husband liked it better than his grandma's homemade chicken and dumplings and the gourmet chef who lives next door tasted it and thought it was an old family recipe.:) He loved it! First you definitly need to add spices. I used cumin parsley poultry seasoning seasoned salt and pepper. Next I only used 1 can of biscuits not 2. (I even used the reduced fat version and they tasted the same!) Thirdly I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. Instead of water I used 3/4 can of low sodium/lowfat chicken broth. At first it seemed like way to much liquid but eventually the biscuits soaked it all up! Fourthly I added 2 CANS of mixed veggies (mix of carrots peas tiny potatoes celery). I am not a fan of canned veggies by any means but they tasted great in this recipe- so tender! I did add red onion but I used only half and chopped the pieces extra small. Lastly I cooked the biscuits for almost 3 hours for a total cooking time of 6.5 hours on high. 30 minutes is just not enough time! Another tip- if you accidentally add too much chicken broth add a bit of sifted flour and the sauce thickens right up! I know that this recipe will be a winter tradition in our household for years to come!,Excellent! Only adjustments needed are as follows: Use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (as directed- don't deviate with other cream soups) cover with 1 14 oz can of chicken broth (no need to cover with water dillutes flavor). Put torn biscuit dough in roughly 90 minutes before ready to serve and make sure that you push them down into the liquid mixture a little so that they get cooked on the tops too and saturated with the chicken flavor. I made this recipe with veggies and without it was better WITHOUT because the consistency was better and the veggie flavor soaked into the dumplings. 5 hours on High is MORE than enough total cooking time. Also leave chicken partially frozen when starting out and don't tear meat until right before adding dumplings this keeps chicken moist. THIS ONE'S A WINNER!!!!,Sorry if this get long winded but I love dumplings. I cant believe how good this recipe is! Ive been raised on my Great Grandma's recipe from West Virgina and was sure this would be horrible. It was really good and I just changed a few things to make it more like Na-Na's. I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup. I added some celery tops with leaves(removed after cooking). And just so theres no confusion the biscuits will turn into dumpling (like noodles) NOT drop biscuits like you would expect. The only thing I would do differently would be to roll the dough out into small pancake sizes and cut that into strips. (The dumplings were just a little doughy-er than we are used to.)A little salt and pepper and with those changes this would be as close to the all day version as you can get. My husband could'nt tell the difference! Really good! Thank-you Janiece.,Wonderful recipe. And for all the morons who simply make a totally different recipe by their additions subtractions cooking a bit longer or shorter...try posting your own recipe and stop giving 4 stars to a perfectly good recipe. All recipes are guidelines. We all have different tastes so either like the recipe or leave it. tiny.mama,I'm giving this 5 stars for it's easiness and flavor. It tastes close enough to homemade to be really enjoyable. I used 2 cans cream of chicken 1 can chicken broth and 1 & 1/2 soupcans of water to cover 2 FROZEN (helps keep it tender) chicken breasts (just 2 of us). I added the water b/c I was worried about the salt and was glad I did. Cooked on low 8-9 hours adding 1 can biscuits 2 hrs before eating. It was very good! I'm biased b/c I was raised on the best dumplings of all time (my mom's) so of course they're not quite homemade but hubby devoured this and I liked it too! The chicken was SO TENDER I was very surprised! I think cooking on low and not cutting up the chicken into chunks before cooking is key so the juices don't just leak out... they get stored in the breast which u can pull apart later. This is great if you're learning to cook in college or just in a pinch for a great meal! Simple yummy and comforting! Thanks for a great recipe & quick lifesaver! We barely had leftovers! Leftover chicken could easily be turned into a soup or even enchiladas the next day! UPDATE 8-27-07: Veggies add water so adjust accordingly or skip water altogether. Right before adding biscuits if liquid's too watery mix a few TBSPNs of flour with cold water & stir into crock pot to thicken. Also cut biscuits into quarters. Cranking up heat to high during biscuit cooking made them cook faster and better - 1 hr instead of 2. So far Pillsbury's Grands Homestyle Buttermilk biscu,This was great! I made changes as suggested by others. I used 8 small breasts used chicken broth instead of water added a bit of white wine (less than 1/4 cup). I seasoned the chicken before cooking with seasoned pepper garlic powder chicken seasoning and paprika. I added fresh celery along with the onion. I added green peas & water & flour for thickening before I added the biscuits. I flattened the biscuits and cut into strips and seasoned with salt & pepper on both sides. Cooked an additional 2 hours on high without opening the lid and it was perfect.,It really irritates me that people give a recipe 5 starts and then proceed to change it so that it's not even the same recipe anymore. If you don't like the recipe as is then don't give it a high rating - post your own separately somewhere else! That's not only rude but it's misleading.,WONDERFUL!! I used chicken broth instead of water and did not use the onion. Did season with salt pepper and a little onion powder. I put on low in morning before going to work and let cook all day. I shredded the chicken(had used frozen chicken breasts) and turned to high and added 2 cans of biscuits each biscuit into 4 pieces. Let cook 1-11/2 hrs on high. Was absolutely the BEST!!,I finally made this recipe today for our Sunday lunch. This was very tasty with my changes. First of all I have the oblong slow cooker so I used 6 small to medium sized breasts first I poured half of a can of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker then placed the chicken that was seasoned with salt pepper poultry seasoning and paprika then I placed the onions on top then a can of cream of chicken soup can of cream of celery soup then the remaining chicken broth. One hour and 45 minutes before serving I shredded the chicken. Then I put the store brand Texas style regular biscuits that I had quartered on top. One can of 10 count biscuits was plenty! This turned out very well and not too liquidy. This will be great to add veggies to and also for cold days. My 16 year old son ate this up like he hadn't been fed in years. Thanks for the post!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
